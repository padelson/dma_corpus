recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by the
parties in writing, provided that the Arbitrator will not be an accounting firm
used by either Seller or Buyer for audit or valuation purposes. The procedures
for the arbitration shall be determined by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall
render a decision resolving the matters in dispute within 30 days following
completion of the submissions to the Arbitrator. Any item not specifically
referred to in the Notice of Disagreement shall be deemed final and binding on
Buyer and Seller in the manner set forth in the Cut-Off Date Working Capital
Statement. The Arbitrator shall determine Final Working Capital based solely on
presentations made by Seller and Buyer (and not by independent review).

            (d) The Non-Prevailing Party in any arbitration before the
Arbitrator shall pay its own expenses incurred with respect to the arbitration
and shall pay a percentage of (i) the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator plus
(ii) the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) of the other party incurred with respect to the arbitration, which
percentage shall be calculated by dividing (A) an amount equal to the difference
between the Non-Prevailing Party's determination of Final Working Capital, as
submitted to the Arbitrator, and the Arbitrator's determination of Final Working
Capital by (B) an amount equal to the difference between the parties' respective
determinations of Final Working Capital, as submitted to the Arbitrator. The
other party shall pay the remainder of the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator
and its own expenses not required to be paid by the Non-Prevailing Party
hereunder. A party is the "Non-Prevailing Party" if the Arbitrator's
determination of Final Working Capital is closer to the other party's
determination of Final Working Capital, as submitted to the Arbitrator, than it
is to that party's determination of Final Working Capital, as submitted to the
Arbitrator. In resolving any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement, the
Arbitrator shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either party.

            (e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Reference Working Capital"
means $97,603,179.

            (f) (i) If Final Working Capital exceeds Reference Working Capital,
the Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by which Final Working
Capital exceeds the Reference Working Capital. If Reference Working Capital
exceeds Final Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount
by which Reference Working Capital exceeds Final Working Capital. The Purchase
Price, as increased or decreased by the adjustment provided for in this Section
2.4(f)(i), is referred to as the "Adjusted Purchase Price."

      (ii)  If the Preliminary Purchase Price is less than the Adjusted Purchase
      Price, Buyer shall, and if the Preliminary Purchase Price is more than the
      Adjusted Purchase Price, Seller shall, within five business days after the
      Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement becomes final and binding on the
      parties, make payment to the other party of the amount of such difference,
      together with interest thereon at the Agreed Rate, calculated on the basis
      of the number of days elapsed from the Closing Date through but excluding
      the payment date.

                                       14

            (g) The term "Working Capital" means (i) the sum of the asset
accounts of the Business included in the Reference Working Capital Statement,
minus (ii) the sum of the liability accounts of the Business included in the
Reference Working Capital Statement. The computation of Working Capital will be
done in a manner consistent with the methods used in the preparation of the
Reference Working Capital Statement, and the governing principle will be that
the adjustment contemplated by this Section 2.4(g) can be appropriately measured
only when Reference Working Capital and Final Working Capital are computed on
the same basis, using the same principles and methodologies consistently
applied; provided, however, that if the Closing does not occur at the end of one
of Seller's fiscal quarters, accounts payable shall be reduced by the amount of
vendor allowances collected by Buyer or the Companies following the Cut-Off Date
with respect to the fiscal quarter in which the Closing occurs, multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed prior to the
Cut-Off Date in the fiscal quarter in which the Closing occurs, and the
denominator of which is 91 days. Following the Cut-Off Date, Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Companies to, collect vendor allowances in the ordinary course
of business consistent with the past practice of the Business. Working Capital
shall not include any liability or obligation with respect to Income Taxes.
Final Working Capital shall not include any performance bonuses accrued for
Retained Employees under the bonus programs described in item 5 of Schedule
4.16(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and set forth on Schedule 1.1(b) as
account number 409402/409602 - Accrued Bonus.

            (h) Seller shall prepare a schedule (the "Inventory Schedule") that
contains a roll forward of the July 2006 physical inventory data to the Cut-Off
Date, using Seller's standard procedures for rolling forward physical inventory
data, and promptly following the completion of the Inventory Schedule, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a copy of the Inventory Schedule. In the event that there
is any dispute regarding the Inventory Schedule prepared pursuant to this
Section 2.4(h), such dispute shall be resolved in connection with the
determination of Final Working Capital, as set forth in Sections 2.4(b) -
2.4(d).

            Section 2.5 Certain Enterprise Agreements. Exhibit H sets forth
certain agreements relating both to the Business and to other businesses or
operations of Seller and its Affiliates. The parties agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary approvals, consents and waivers so
that Buyer may use that portion of such agreements (and any applicable schedules
thereto) that relate exclusively to the Business; provided, however, that Seller
and its Affiliates shall not be required to make any payments or offer or grant
any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain any
approval, consent or waiver. If, prior to the Closing, all necessary approvals,
consents and waivers are not obtained with respect to any such agreement, then
(to the maximum extent permitted by Requirements of Law or any applicable
agreement) to the extent related to the Business, Buyer shall be responsible for
the obligations and liabilities of the Business under such agreement after the
Cut-Off Date (but not such agreement itself), and Buyer shall receive the
claims, rights and benefits of Seller arising under such agreement or resulting
therefrom after the Cut-Off Date (but not such agreement itself).

            Section 2.6 Assignment of Certain Contracts. At the Closing, Seller
agrees to, and to cause Seller's Affiliates to, assign, sell, transfer, convey
and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to acquire from Seller and its
Affiliates, all of Seller's and its Affiliates' right, title and

                                       15
<PAGE>

interest as of the Effective Time in all Contracts (excluding Seller's
agreements with each of the owners or licensors of the private brands set forth
in Exhibit K) which, although none of the Companies is the contracting party
thereto, is in each case solely related to the Business (other than with respect
to purchase orders, which shall be transferred to Buyer to the extent they
relate to the Business), together with those Contracts set forth in Exhibit F
hereto (collectively, the "Assigned Contracts"). At the Closing, Buyer shall
assume, and hereby agrees to pay, perform and observe fully and timely,
effective as of the Effective Time, all liabilities and obligations relating to
or arising out of the Assigned Contracts (collectively, the liabilities and
obligations so assumed being referred to as the "Assumed Contract Liabilities").

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

            As an inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller represents and warrants
to Buyer as follows:

            Section 4.1 Organization of Seller; Power and Authority of Seller;
Ownership of the Companies. Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Tennessee. All of
the issued and outstanding equity interests of each Company are held of record
and beneficially owned directly or indirectly by Seller. Seller is duly
qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the character of its properties owned or held under lease or the nature of
its activities, in each case in respect of the Business, makes such
qualifications necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has the corporate power and authority to
own or lease and operate its assets with respect to the Business and to carry on
the Business in the manner it was conducted immediately prior to the date of
this Agreement.

            Section 4.2 Organization; Power and Authority; Capital Structure of
the Companies. (a) Each of the Companies is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation. Each of the Companies is duly qualified to transact business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned or held under lease or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Company has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease and operate its assets and to carry on the Business in
the manner that it was conducted immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement.

            (b) The authorized capital stock of Parisian Stores, Inc. consists
of 10,000 shares of Class A common voting stock, par value $1.00 per share, of
which 7,220.50 shares are issued and outstanding, and 190,000 shares of Class B
common non-voting stock, par value $1.00 per share, of which 147,851.50 shares

value $.01 per share, of which 1,000 shares are issued and outstanding. Seller
owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Parisian
Stores, Inc., Parisian Wholesalers, Inc. and Parisian Alabama, Inc., free and
clear of all Encumbrances. All such capital stock is duly authorized, validly
issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, and free of preemptive
rights. Except for this Agreement, there are no commitments to issue or sell any
shares of capital stock or any securities or obligations convertible into or
exchangeable for, or giving any Person any right to acquire from Seller or the
Companies, any shares of capital stock of the Companies, and no such securities
or obligations are outstanding.

date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Seller has approved the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Seller has all requisite corporate
power to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller and
the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Seller and each
of the Seller Ancillary Agreements has been duly authorized by Seller. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller and (assuming the valid
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer and the
validity and binding effect of this Agreement on Buyer) constitutes the valid
and binding obligation of Seller enforceable against Seller in accordance with
its terms, and each of the Seller Ancillary Agreements, upon execution and
delivery by Seller will be (assuming the valid authorization, execution and
delivery by Buyer, where Buyer is a party, and any other party or parties
thereto) a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject, in the case of this Agreement and each of
the Seller Ancillary Agreements, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general application relating to or affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights and to general principles of equity.

            (b) Subject to Section 4.9(d) and except as set forth in Schedule

execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the Seller Ancillary
Agreements by Seller, the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated

      the filing of all necessary documents as described in Section 4.4(b)(ii),
      result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or
      constitute a default, an event of default or an event creating rights of
      acceleration, termination or cancellation or a loss of rights under, or
      result in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance upon any of the

      bylaws or similar organizational documents of Seller or the Companies, (2)
      any Business Agreement, (3) any Court Order to which Seller or the
      Companies is a party or by which Seller or the Companies is bound or (4)
      any Requirements of Law affecting Seller or the Companies, other than, in
      the case of clauses (2), (3) and (4) above, any such breaches, defaults,
      rights, loss of rights or Encumbrances that would not, individually or in
      the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or
      would not prevent the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
      hereby, or

            (ii) require the approval, consent, authorization or act of, or the
      making by Seller or the Companies of any declaration, filing or

      triggered by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (5) such
      filings as may be required in connection with the Taxes described in
      Section 7.2(a)(v), and (6) such approvals, consents, authorizations,
      declarations, filings or registrations the failure of which to be obtained
      or made would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or would not prevent the
      consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

            No representation or warranty is made as to whether any new
governmental approvals, consents, licenses, permits, orders, authorizations,
declarations, filings or registrations will be required as a result of the sale
of the Shares to Buyer in order for Buyer to continue to conduct the Business
following the Cut-Off Date in the manner in which the Business was conducted on

Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Seller to be fully
released, in each case, effective as promptly as practicable after the Cut-Off

loan, contract, lease or other obligation that is covered by an Other Guaranty
or an Identified Guaranty without providing Seller with evidence satisfactory to
Seller that Seller's Other Guaranty or Identified Guaranty has been released.
Any cash or other collateral posted by Seller or one of its Affiliates in
respect of any Other Guaranty or any Identified Guaranty shall be delivered to
Seller.

"Account Receivables" (as each such term is defined in the Program Agreement)
associated with such stores from HSBC for the price set forth in Section 9.05(b)
of the Program Agreement and (ii) pay over to Seller on the effective date of
such purchase cash in the amount equal to the difference between (x) the amount
paid to HSBC in connection with such purchase and (y) the amount equal to the
price set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of the second sentence of Section 9.06
of the Program Agreement multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall
be the sum of the Account Receivables associated with the stores of the Business
(as of the date of purchase) and the denominator of which shall be the sum of
the Account Receivables associated with all stores (including the stores of the
Business) covered by the Program Agreement (as of the date of purchase). Buyer
agrees to obtain all necessary consents and approvals from all Governmental
Bodies and to make all necessary registrations and filings in order to effect
this Section 6.9. At Buyer's request, Seller agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in complying with this Section 6.9;
provided, however, that Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required to make
any payments or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any
third party with respect to this Section 6.9.

            Section 6.10 Treatment of Specified Assets and Liabilities. (a)
Prior to the Closing, Seller shall be entitled to cause the transfer (by
dividend or otherwise) of the following assets to an Affiliate of Seller: (i)
any cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities held by the Companies (other
than Register Cash), (ii) any receivables and (iii) all furniture, fixtures,
equipment and other personal property used primarily by the employees set forth
in Exhibit J.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
receipts by and receivables of Seller or the Companies received or arising on or
before the Cut-Off Date, including cash (excluding Register Cash), checks and
bank drafts (whether cleared before or after the Effective Time), and proceeds
from third-party credit card or debit card transactions (whether posted before
or after the Effective Time) shall be excluded from the transactions
contemplated hereby, and Buyer shall cause payment in an aggregate amount equal
to such

                                       41
<PAGE>

receipts and receivables to be made by Buyer or the Companies to Seller
immediately after Seller makes demand therefor; provided, however, that (i) this
Section 6.10(b) shall not affect accounts and account receivables owned by HSBC
and (ii) Seller shall cause the Business to be in possession of the Register
Cash at the opening of the stores of the Companies on the day after the Cut-Off
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Reference Working Capital and Final Working
Capital shall be determined without giving effect to any such cash, checks, bank
drafts, proceeds or receivables.

            (c) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the Business may have cash,
checks and bank drafts on hand greater than Register Cash as of the Effective
Time. Seller will determine as soon as practicable in accordance with its
standard cash accounting procedures the actual amount of cash, checks and bank
drafts in the stores of the Business as of the Effective Time and provide Buyer
notice of such amounts. Without in any way limiting Seller's rights under
Section 6.10(b), Buyer and Seller will settle via wire transfer of immediately
available funds within two business days after such notice is given by Seller to
Buyer any variance from the Register Cash, together with interest thereon at the
Agreed Rate, calculated on the basis of the number of days elapsed from the
Effective Time through but excluding the payment date.

            (d) Seller shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Buyer Group Member from, any liability or obligation to the extent
relating to, resulting from or arising out of any former operations or
properties of any of the Companies that have been discontinued or disposed of
prior to the Effective Time.

            Section 6.11 Capital Expenditures Prior to Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller and its Affiliates may make
and undertake any work contemplated by the Capital Expenditures described on
Schedule 6.11 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "Pre-Approved
Capital Expenditures"), in addition to the Approved Capital Expenditures. Buyer
will at Closing pay to Seller the amount expended by Seller or its Affiliates on
account of all Pre-Approved Capital Expenditures and Approved Capital
Expenditures made after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, and Buyer will
assume responsibility for and release Seller from liability for all such
expenditures.

            Section 6.12 Private Brands.

            (a) During the period prior to the Effective Time, Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts so that
Buyer and its Affiliates will receive, at or prior to the Effective Time,
consents from each of the owners or licensors of the private brands set forth in
Exhibit K (collectively, the "Third Party Brand Licensors") in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Private Brands Agreement.

            (b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to enter into such agreements with third-party vendors as are necessary
to enable Seller to deliver Products (as defined in the Private Brands
Agreement) to Buyer; provided, however, that Seller and its Affiliates shall
have no obligation to pay money or grant any accommodation to any third party in
order to enter into such agreements, except to the extent that Buyer agrees to
reimburse

                                       42
<PAGE>

Seller or such Affiliate for any such payment made by Seller or such Affiliate
at the request of Buyer.

            (c) Buyer acknowledges that a draft of Schedule 1 of the Private
Brands Agreement will be delivered within 10 days of the date hereof based on
information then readily available to Seller. Schedule 1 of the Private Brands
Agreement will be finalized by Seller as of five days before the Closing to
reflect new order and fill-in orders placed (in each case, subject to Section
6.4(b)(xix)), goods received, new information obtained and other adjustments
made in the ordinary course of business between the date Schedule 1 was
originally prepared and the date Schedule 1 is finalized (regardless of expected
delivery date). At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer such finalized
Schedule 1.

            Section 6.13 No Solicitation. After the date hereof and prior to the
earlier of the Closing and the date on which this Agreement is terminated,
Seller shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Affiliates,
advisors or agents, directly or indirectly, to (a) knowingly solicit, initiate
or encourage or facilitate the making of an Alternative Proposal or (b)
participate in, engage in, knowingly encourage or facilitate any discussion or
negotiation regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to,
or knowingly take any other action to assist or facilitate any inquiries or the
making of, any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Alternative Proposal; provided, however, that nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prevent Seller or its Board of Directors from soliciting or
initiating the submission of any Seller Acquisition Proposal.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

            Section 7.1 Use of Names. (a) Seller is not conveying ownership
rights or granting Buyer or the Companies a license to use any of the trade
names, service marks or trademarks of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other
than trademarks and service marks included in the Registered Intellectual
Property identified on Schedule 4.11(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule as
being owned by the Companies) (collectively, the "Retained Names and Marks")
and, after the Closing, Buyer shall not permit the Companies or any Affiliate of
the Companies to use in any manner the names or marks of Seller or any Affiliate
of Seller or any word that is similar in sound or appearance to such names or
marks, except as provided in this Section 7.1. In the event Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer violates any of its obligations under this Section 7.1,
Seller and its Affiliates may proceed against it in law or in equity for such
damages or other relief as a court may deem appropriate. Buyer acknowledges that
a violation of this Section 7.1 may cause Seller and its Affiliates irreparable
harm which may not be adequately compensated for by money damages. Buyer
therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or threatened violation of this
Section 7.1, Seller and each of its Affiliates shall be entitled, in addition to
other remedies that they may have, to a temporary restraining order and to
preliminary and final injunctive relief against Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer
to prevent any violations of this Section 7.1, without the necessity of posting
a bond.

            (b) Buyer shall cause the Companies to cease promptly, but in no
event later than 60 days after the Cut-Off Date, using any (i) advertising or
promotional materials and (ii)

                                       43
<PAGE>

any stationery, business cards, business forms and other similar items owned by
the Companies as of the Closing Date, in each case that contain anywhere thereon
any of the Retained Names and Marks; provided, however, that Buyer shall cause
the Companies, when using items referred to in clause (ii) in the context of
entering into or conducting contractual relationships, to make reasonably clear
to all other applicable parties that Buyer or one of the Companies, rather than
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Companies), is the party
entering into or conducting the contractual relationship; and provided, further,
that Buyer shall ensure that personnel of the Companies using such items shall
not, and shall have no authority to, hold themselves out as officers, employees
or agents of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller.

            (c) Buyer shall cause the Companies to cease promptly, but in no
event later than 120 days after the Closing Date, using any packaging materials
owned by the Companies as of the Closing Date that contain anywhere thereon any
of the Retained Names and Marks, unless such materials are changed to completely
and permanently cover, delete or obliterate the Retained Names and Marks or
anything confusingly similar thereto.

            (d) Buyer shall have the right to exhaust all inventories of
finished products owned by any of them as of the Cut-Off Date that contain as
part of the physical products themselves (e.g., embroidered on a shirt or a
label on a shirt, but not product packaging covered by clause (c) above) any of
the Retained Names and Marks, provided that Buyer shall cause the Companies to
use all commercially reasonable efforts to dispose of such finished products
promptly after the Cut-Off Date.

            (e) Other than as permitted under clauses (b) through (d) above,
Buyer shall not and shall cause the Companies not to use, without the prior
written consent of Seller, any of the Retained Names and Marks (or anything
confusingly similar thereto) in any manner whatsoever.

            (f) At the Closing, Buyer will cause the Companies to enter into a
short-term trademark and trade name license agreement that grants Seller and
Affiliates of Seller the right to use the trademarks and trade names specified
on Schedule 4.11(a) in a manner similar to the manner in which Seller and
Affiliates of Seller use such trademarks and trade names as of the date of this
Agreement for a period of up to 180 days following the Cut-Off Date.

            Section 7.2 Tax Matters. (a) Liability for Taxes. (i) Seller shall
be liable for and pay, and pursuant to Article X (and subject to the limitations
thereof) shall indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Group Member against any
and all Taxes (A) imposed on any of the Companies pursuant to Treas. Reg. ss.
1.1502-6 or similar provision of state or local law solely as a result of the
Companies having been members of the Seller's Affiliated Group, (B) imposed on
any of the Companies, or for which any of the Companies may otherwise be liable,
for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Cut-Off Date and, with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
and including the Cut-Off Date, (C) any Section 338 Taxes, (D) any Income Taxes
arising from transactions outside the ordinary course of business after the
Cut-Off Date but before the Closing, (E) any Income Taxes imposed as a result of
the Companies ceasing to be members of Seller's Affiliated Group on the Closing
Date, under the intercompany transaction and excess loss account rules described
in Treasury

                                       44
<PAGE>

Regulations under Section 1052 of the Code, and (F) any Taxes imposed by reason
of the transfer of assets pursuant to Section 6.10 (the "Section 6.10 Taxes");
provided, however, that Seller shall not be liable for or pay, and does not
agree to indemnify or hold harmless any Buyer Group Member from and against, (I)
Taxes to the extent shown as a liability on the Cut-Off Date Working Capital
Statement, and (II) any Taxes (other than Section 338 Taxes) that result from
any actual or deemed election under Section 338 of the Code or any similar
provisions of state, local or foreign law as a result of the purchase of the
Shares of Parisian Wholesalers, Inc. or that result from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement otherwise being treated as a purchase or sale of
assets of any of the Companies for federal, state, local or other Tax purposes
(Taxes described in this proviso, hereinafter "Excluded Taxes"). Seller shall be
entitled to any refund of (or credit for) Taxes for which Seller is liable
pursuant to this Section 7.2, except for any refund to the extent shown as an
asset on the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement.

            (ii) Buyer shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to Article X
      (and subject to the limitations thereof) shall indemnify and hold harmless
      each Seller Group Member from and against, (A) any and all Taxes imposed
      on any of the Companies, or for which any of the Companies may otherwise
      be liable, for any taxable year or period that begins after the Cut-Off
      Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
      Straddle Period beginning immediately after the Cut-Off Date (except for
      Income Taxes described in Section 7.2(a)(i)(C), (B) Excluded Taxes, and
      (C) in the case of any Tax, the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of such
      Tax shown as a liability on the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement
      over (ii) the amount of Tax that would have been shown as a liability on
      the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement if such amount had been based
      on the actual amount of Tax paid; provided, however, that Seller shall be
      liable for all Section 6.10 Taxes. Within ten (10) days after the payment
      of any Tax shown as a liability on the Cut-Off Date Working Capital
      Statement, Buyer shall provide Seller with an officer's certificate
      stating the amount of any excess described in clause (C) of the preceding
      sentence with respect to such Tax. Except as otherwise provided herein,
      Buyer shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit for) Taxes for which
      Buyer is liable pursuant to this Section 7.2.

            (iii) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(i) and (a)(ii), whenever it is
      necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of any of the Companies for
      a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of such Company for the
      portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of
      the Straddle Period beginning after, the Cut-Off Date shall be determined
      by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or
      periods, one which ended at the close of the Cut-Off Date and the other
      which began at the beginning of the day following the Cut-Off Date, and
      items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Companies for the
      Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or
      periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of
      the Companies were closed at the close of the Cut-Off Date, and by
      assuming that the Companies ceased filing consolidated, combined or
      unitary Tax Returns with Seller's Affiliated Group as of the close of the
      Cut-Off Date; provided, however, that exemptions, allowances or deductions
      that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for
      depreciation, shall be apportioned between such two

                                       45
<PAGE>

      taxable years or periods on a daily basis. In the case of a Straddle
      Period ending on the Closing Date, the amount of Taxes (other than Income
      Taxes) for such Straddle Period that relates to the portion of the
      Straddle Period ending on and including the Cut-Off Date shall be deemed
      to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by
      a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle
      Period ending on the Cut-Off Date and the denominator of which is the
      number of days in such Straddle Period.

            (iv) If, as a result of any action, suit, investigation, audit,
      claim, assessment or amended Tax Return, there is any change after the
      Cut-Off Date in an item of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or amount
      of Tax that results in an increase in a Tax liability for which Seller
      would otherwise be liable pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7.2,
      and such change is reasonably expected to result in a decrease in the Tax
      liability of any of the Companies, Buyer or any Affiliate or successor of
      any thereof for any taxable year or period beginning after the Cut-Off
      Date or for the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Cut-Off
      Date, Seller shall not be liable pursuant to such paragraph (a) with
      respect to such increase to the extent of such decrease (and, to the
      extent such increase in Tax liability is paid to a taxing authority by
      Seller or any Affiliate thereof, Buyer shall pay Seller an amount equal to
      such decrease).

            (v) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall
      indemnify Seller and its Affiliates for any deduction allowed to Buyer or
      its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, any of the Companies)
      for compensation (including any deduction for amounts treated as
      compensation under Treas. Reg. ss. 1.83-7) paid or payable by Seller or
      any of its Affiliates (other than, after the Effective Time, the
      Companies) in cash, stock or other property.

            (vi) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall
      pay, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Group Member
      from and against any and all real property transfer or gains Taxes, sales
      Taxes, use Taxes, stamp Taxes, stock transfer Taxes, or other similar
      Taxes imposed on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
      (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), except that Seller shall pay, and agrees
      to indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Group Member from and against,
      any Transfer Taxes that are Section 6.10 Taxes.

            (b) Tax Returns. (i) Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely
filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Income
Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Companies
for taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date (in the case
of Income Taxes filed on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with Seller
or an Affiliate thereof (other than solely another Company)) and Seller shall
remit, out of its own funds, any Taxes shown to be due in respect of such Income
Tax Returns and all non-Income Tax Returns with respect to the Companies that
are due on or before the Cut-Off Date, and Seller shall cause to be remitted,
out of funds of the Companies, any Taxes shown to be due in respect of such Tax
Returns. Buyer shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained) all other Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to the Companies and Buyer shall remit
or cause to be

                                       46
<PAGE>

remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. With respect to Tax
Returns to be filed by Seller after the date hereof for non Income Taxes (I)
such Tax Returns shall be filed in a manner consistent with past practice and no
position shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent
with positions taken, elections made or methods used in prior periods in filing
such Tax Returns and (II) if requested by Buyer, such Tax Returns shall be
submitted to Buyer not later than 10 days prior to the due date for filing such
Tax Returns for review and approval by Buyer, which approval may not be
unreasonably withheld, but may in all cases be withheld if such Tax Returns were
not prepared in accordance with clause (I) of this sentence. Seller or Buyer
shall pay the other party for the Taxes for which Seller or Buyer, respectively,
is liable pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7.2 but which are payable
with any Tax Return to be filed by the other party pursuant to this paragraph
(b) upon the written request of the party entitled to payment, setting forth in
reasonable detail the computation of the amount owed by Seller or Buyer, as the
case may be, but in no event earlier than 15 business days prior to the due date
for paying such Taxes.

            (ii) None of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall cause
      or permit the Companies to) amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an
      extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return
      relating in whole or in part to the Companies with respect to any taxable
      year or period ending on or before the Cut-Off Date (or with respect to
      any Straddle Period) without the prior written consent of Seller, which
      consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

            (iii) Buyer shall promptly cause each of the Companies to prepare
      and provide to Seller a package of Tax information materials, including
      schedules and work papers (the "Tax Package") required by Seller to enable
      Seller to prepare and file all Tax Returns required to be prepared and
      filed by it pursuant to paragraph (b)(i). The Tax Package shall be
      completed in accordance with past practice, including past practice as to
      providing such information and as to the method of computation of separate
      taxable income or other relevant measure of income of each of the
      Companies. Buyer shall cause the Tax Package to be delivered to Seller
      within 45 days after the Closing Date.

            (c) Contest Provisions. (i) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in
writing upon receipt by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or the Companies of notice
of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits,
examinations or assessments which might affect the Tax liabilities for which
Seller may be liable pursuant to this Section 7.2.

            (ii) Seller shall have the sole right to represent each Company's
      interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating
      to Taxes for which Seller may be liable pursuant to this Section 7.2, and
      to employ counsel of its -- choice at its expense. In the case of a
      Straddle Period (other than a Straddle Period ending on or before the
      Closing Date), Buyer shall be entitled to participate at its expense in
      any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating (in whole or
      in part) to Income Taxes attributable to the portion of such Straddle
      Period beginning after the Cut-Off Date and, with the written consent of
      Seller, and at Buyer's sole expense, may assume the entire control of such
      audit or proceeding. None of Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any of the
      Companies may settle any claim for any Taxes for which Seller may be
      liable pursuant to

                                       47
<PAGE>

      paragraph (a) of this Section 7.2, without the prior written consent of
      Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

            (d) Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing Date, each of
Seller and Buyer shall (and cause their respective Affiliates to):

            (i) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such
      other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with
      Section 7.2(b);

            (ii) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes
      with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Companies;

            (iii) make available to the other and to any taxing authority as
      reasonably requested all information, records, and documents relating to
      Taxes of the Companies;

            (iv) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or
      threatened Tax audits or assessments of the Companies for taxable periods
      for which the other may have a liability under this Section 7.2;

            (v) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received
      from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information
      request with respect to any such Tax;

            (vi) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be
      necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise
      reduce), or file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes
      described in Section 7.2(a)(v) (relating to sales, transfer and similar
      Taxes); and

            (vii) timely provide to the other party powers of attorney or
      similar authorizations necessary to carry out the purposes of this Section
      7.2.

            (e) Election Under Section 338(h)(10). (i) In connection with the
purchase of the Shares of Parisian Wholesalers, Inc. hereunder, Seller and Buyer
shall make a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and under any
applicable similar provisions of state or local law (collectively, the "Section
338(h)(10) Elections") Seller and Buyer shall within 30 days after the
completion of the Allocation Schedule, but in no event later than 15 days prior
to the due date for filing Internal Revenue Service Form 8023, exchange
completed and executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form 8023, required
schedules thereto, and any similar state and local forms. If any changes are
required in these forms as a result of information which is first available
after these forms are prepared, the parties will promptly agree on such changes.

            (ii) Buyer and Seller shall jointly appoint an independent appraiser
      (the "Appraiser") to conduct and to deliver to Buyer and Seller, within 90
      days following the Closing Date, an appraisal (the "Appraisal") of the
      fair market value as of the Closing Date of the assets of Parisian
      Wholesalers, Inc. The cost of the Appraisal shall be paid by Buyer.

                                       48
<PAGE>

            (ii) Within 30 days following receipt of the Appraisal, Buyer and
      Seller shall negotiate and draft a schedule (the "Allocation Schedule")
      allocating the Adjusted Deemed Sales Price, as defined in Treas. Reg.
      Section 1.338-4T, for Parisian Wholesalers, Inc. among the assets of
      Parisian Wholesalers, Inc. The Allocation Schedule shall be reasonable and
      shall be prepared in accordance with Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and
      the Treasury Regulations thereunder and in accordance with the Appraisal.
      Buyer and Seller each agrees that promptly upon receiving said Allocation
      Schedule it shall return an executed copy thereof to the other party.
      Buyer and Seller each agrees to file all federal, state, local and foreign
      Tax Returns in accordance with the Appraisal and the Allocation Schedule.

            Section 7.3 Employees and Employee Benefits.

            (a) Offers of Employment. Buyer will cause the Companies to continue
the employment effective immediately after the Effective Time of all Business
Employees, including each such employee on medical, disability, family or other
leave of absence as of the Effective Time, except those Business Employees who
at the Effective Time are receiving long-term disability benefits under any
Seller Plan, which Business Employees will be offered employment by Buyer
provided that they report for active employment within six months after the date
on which they began receiving long-term disability benefits. At the Closing,
Seller will provide to Buyer a list showing the names of each then employee on
leave of absence. The continued employment immediately following the Effective
Time of each Business Employee shall in each case provide (i) at least the same
base wages, annual base salary and annual rate of bonus potential at target
performance levels (determined as a percentage of annual base salary) (other
than employee benefits, which are subject to Section 7.3(c)) as the base wages,
annual base salary and annual base rate of bonus potential at target performance
levels (determined as a percentage of annual base salary) (but excluding any
equity-based compensation) provided to each such employee on the Cut-Off Date
and (ii) with respect to any Business Employee who is a participant in the
Severance Pay Plan, employment at a location not more than fifty (50) miles from
the Business Employee's current location. The Business Employees who continue to
be employees of the Companies immediately following the Effective Time are
referred to as "Retained Employees." Nothing in this Section 7.3(a) shall
obligate Buyer or the Companies to continue the employment of any such Retained
Employee for any specific period (it being understood that Buyer and the
Companies shall be obligated to pay severance benefits pursuant to Section
7.3(d)).

            (b) Individual Employment Contracts. As of the Effective Time, Buyer
will assume, or will cause the Companies to assume or retain, as the case may
be, Seller's or the Companies' obligations under the Employment Agreements
described in items 1, 2 and 3 of Schedule 4.18(e) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, and all of the obligations as the employer under such contracts and
agreements; provided, however, that Seller shall (i) remain responsible for (A)
the obligations as the employer under such contracts and agreements set forth in
items 4 through 13 and item 15 of Schedule 4.18(e) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule and (B) any obligations under such Employment Agreements as in effect
at the Effective Time relating to or arising out of Seller's equity-based
compensation and (ii) pay as of the Closing (or promptly thereafter) all
performance bonuses accrued for each Retained Employee under the bonus

                                       49
<PAGE>

programs described in item 5 of Schedule 4.16(e) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule. Buyer shall assume Seller's responsibility to pay the retention
bonuses called for under the retention arrangements described in item 14 of
Schedule 4.18(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule when, and to the extent,
payable under the terms of such arrangements.

            (c) Buyer's Employee Benefit Plans Generally. As of the Effective
Time, Buyer shall make available to each Retained Employee employee benefits
(other than benefits under Buyer's employee benefit plan which is a defined
benefit plan within the meaning of Section 414(j) of the Code) that are at least
comparable to the benefits that are made available to an employee of Buyer who
performs comparable services or undertakes comparable responsibilities for Buyer
and who has completed the same length of service with Buyer. After the Effective
Time, except as otherwise provided in the following subsections of this Section
7.3, the following shall apply:

            (i) As of the Effective Time, Buyer will assume, or will cause the
      Companies to continue, the Parisian Associates' Assistance Plan.

            (ii) As of the Effective Time, Buyer will assume, or will cause the
      Companies or Buyer's or the Companies' Pension Plans or Welfare Plans, as
      applicable, to assume, all liabilities and obligations for benefits
      payable under each Seller Plan and employee or fringe benefit plan or
      arrangement set forth in Schedule 7.3(c)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure
      Schedule to or with - respect to (A) any Business Employee, including any
      employee on medical, disability, family or other leave of absence as of
      the Cut-Off Date, (B) any former employee of the Business who was on the
      payroll of the Companies on the date the individual's most recent
      termination of employment from Seller and all of the Affiliates of Seller
      occurred and (C) any dependent or former dependent of any such employee or
      former employee, including any dependent or former dependent entitled to
      COBRA coverage assumed by Buyer under Section 7.3(h) (collectively,
      "Covered Persons"). Such assumed liabilities include liabilities that
      relate to events occurring or expenses incurred at or prior to the
      Effective Time but that have not been paid as of the Effective Time. Any
      such benefits related to events occurring or expenses incurred after the
      Effective Time shall be determined under the terms of Buyer's Plans,
      except as provided to the contrary in the following subsections of this
      Section 7.3.

            (iii) Buyer shall give each Retained Employee service credit under
      Buyer's DC Plan and plans which provide benefits described in Section 3(1)
      of ERISA ("Buyer's Welfare Plans" and, together with Buyer's DC Plan,
      "Buyer's Plans") or personnel policies that cover the Retained Employee,
      including any vacation, sick leave and severance policies, for purposes of
      eligibility, vesting and entitlement to vacation, sick leave and severance
      benefits for the Retained Employee's service with Seller and its
      Affiliates prior to the Effective Time on the same basis as Buyer credits
      services for its own employees and, with respect to Buyer's Welfare Plans,
      shall allow such Retained Employees to participate in each such Welfare
      Plan of Buyer without regard to preexisting-condition limitations, waiting
      periods, evidence of insurability or other exclusions or limitations not
      imposed on the Retained Employee by the corresponding Welfare Plans of
      Seller in which such Retained Employee was a participant immediately

                                       50
<PAGE>

      prior to the Effective Time and shall credit the Retained Employee with
      any expenses that were paid by the Retained Employee under the Welfare
      Plans of Seller for purposes of determining deductibles, co-pays and other
      applicable limits under Buyer's Plans. To the extent any Retained Employee
      or eligible dependent of any Retained Employee is hospitalized as of the
      Effective Time under any Seller Plan providing medical benefits, such
      person will continue to be covered under the medical coverage provided by
      such Seller Plan until the date such Retained Employee or such eligible
      dependent is released from the hospital, and Buyer or the Companies shall
      reimburse Seller for any expenses associated with such extended hospital
      stay payable under any Seller Plan that are incurred after the Effective
      Time.

            (iv) No portion of the assets of any trust or other fund maintained
      by Seller (except for the Parisian Associates' Assistance Plan) for the
      purpose of paying benefits under any of the Seller Plans will be
      transferred to Buyer, the Companies or any Buyer's Plan.

            (d) Severance Benefits. If any Retained Employee who is not a
participant in the Severance Pay Plan is involuntarily terminated by Buyer or
the Companies in the fiscal year that includes the Cut-Off Date, Buyer will
cause the Companies to provide to the Retained Employee under Buyer's Plans
benefits that are at least equal to the severance pay and other benefits
specified in Schedule 4.16(f) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Buyer and
Seller agree that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
treated as if they were a "change of control" under the Severance Pay Plan. If
any Retained Employee is entitled to severance benefits under the Severance Pay
Plan pursuant to the "change of control" provisions thereunder (giving effect to
the treatment of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a "change of
control" under the Severance Pay Plan), Buyer will cause the Companies to
provide to such Retained Employee the severance pay and other benefits provided
under the Severance Pay Plan in lieu of any severance to which such Retained
Employee would be entitled under any Buyer's Plan.

            (e) Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays. Buyer shall credit to each
Retained Employee all unpaid vacation and personal holiday pay for calendar year
2006 that the Retained Employee is entitled to use for calendar year 2006 but
has not used as of the Effective Time and shall assume all liability for the
payment of such amounts pursuant to the Seller vacation and personal holiday pay
policies listed in Schedule 4.16(e) to the extent such vacation and holidays are
taken in calendar year 2006; provided, however, that no credit under this
Section 7.3(e) shall duplicate any credit under Section 7.3(c)(iii).

            (f) Disability Benefits and Leaves. (i) Seller and the Seller Plans
shall retain the liability for all long-term disability benefits payable to any
Retained Employee who is receiving or is entitled to receive long-term
disability benefits under the terms of any Seller Plan at the Effective Time and
shall continue to provide such benefits in accordance with the terms of such
plan until the Retained Employee is no longer eligible for such benefits, (ii)
Buyer or a Buyer's Plan shall provide short-term disability benefits to any
Retained Employee who is receiving or is eligible for such benefits under a
Seller Plan at the Effective Time until the date such Retained Employee would no
longer be eligible for such benefits under such Seller Plan or

                                       51
<PAGE>

the date on which the Retained Employee would (if still employed by Seller)
qualify for long-term disability benefits under a Seller Plan, whichever comes
first, and, if such a Retained Employee would (if still employed by Seller)
qualify for long-term disability benefits under a Seller Plan, Buyer shall
provide such long-term disability benefits to such Retained Employee under
Buyer's Plans and (iii) Buyer's Plans will govern the determination of what, if
any, short-term and long-term disability benefits will be paid to any Retained
Employee whose disability occurs after the Effective Time (or which reoccurs
after the Effective Time). If any Retained Employee is on any form of leave of
absence on the Effective Time (including any leave subject to the Family and
Medical Leave Act of 1993 or comparable state law), Buyer shall reinstate such
Retained Employee to active employment upon the expiration of the leave to the
extent such reinstatement is required by any applicable law or regulation or by
Buyer's personnel policies and shall satisfy any other obligation with respect
to such Retained Employee as required under any applicable law or regulation or
Buyer's personnel policies.

            (g) Medical and Dental Plan Liabilities. Buyer shall, or shall cause
the Companies or the applicable Buyer's Plan to, assume and pay any benefits or
expenses covered by the group medical and dental plans included within the
Seller Plans that were incurred with respect to services performed for Covered
Persons prior to the Effective Time but have not been paid by the Plans prior to
the Cut-Off Date. If Buyer provides such Buyer's Plans to a Retained Employee
following the Cut-Off Date, Buyer shall pay or shall cause the applicable
Buyer's Plan to assume and pay any such benefits or expenses that are incurred
with respect to services performed for the Retained Employee or the Retained
Employee's dependents after the Effective Time.

            (h) COBRA Coverage. Effective as of the Effective Time, Buyer shall
provide (or cause a Buyer's Plan to provide) all entitlements under Code Section
4980B, Part 6 or 7 of Title I of ERISA or any similar state law (collectively,
"COBRA") to Retained Employees and eligible dependents of Retained Employees
with respect to any event which requires the provision of such entitlements and
which occurs at or after the Effective Time. Seller shall provide (or cause the
applicable Seller Plan to provide) all entitlements under COBRA to Retained
Employees and eligible dependents of Retained Employees with respect to any
event which requires the provision of such entitlements and which occurs before
the Effective Time.

            (i) Flexible Spending Accounts. Buyer will, or will cause the
Companies to, credit each Retained Employee (and any former employee of the
Business or dependent or former dependent of an employee or former employee who
has COBRA rights described in Section 7.3(h) with respect to flexible spending
accounts) under a health care and dependent care flexible spending account plan
or plans maintained by Buyer or the Companies ("Buyer's Flex Plans") with a
balance (positive or negative) as of the Cut-Off Date equal to the balance
credited to the individual under the applicable health care and dependent care
flexible spending account plans included within the Seller Plans listed in
Schedule 4.16(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule ("Seller's Flex Plans") as of
the Cut-Off Date ("Aggregate Flex Plan Balances"), and will reimburse each such
individual for expenses incurred during the current plan year of such Seller
Flex Plan (whether incurred before or after the Cut-Off Date) that had not been
reimbursed under such Seller Flex Plan prior to the Cut-Off Date (to the same
extent such eligible expense

                                       52
<PAGE>

would have been reimbursable under such Seller Flex Plan). As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Cut-Off Date, Seller shall transfer assets to Buyer's
Flex Plan equal to the Aggregate Flex Plan Balances and Buyer, the Companies and
Seller will treat the arrangement described in this Section 7.3(i) as a spin-off
of the applicable portions of the Seller's Flex Plans and a merger of such
portions into Buyer's Flex Plans.

            (j) Retirement and 401(k) Plans.

            (i) Buyer will have no liability for benefits payable under the Saks
      Incorporated 401(k) Retirement Plan ("Seller's DC Plan"). Seller shall
      take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to fully vest Retained
      Employees under Seller's DC Plan and all other Seller Plans that are
      deferred compensation or supplemental retirement plans.

            (ii) Buyer currently maintains one or more qualified defined
      contribution plans ("Buyer's DC Plan") that contains all provisions
      necessary for the acceptance of direct rollovers (in the form of cash and
      notes relating to plan participant loans not in default) of "eligible
      rollover distributions" as defined in the Code and applicable regulations
      that Retained Employees are eligible to receive from Seller's DC Plan.
      Buyer's DC Plan will contain provisions to permit any such direct rollover
      to include the promissory note or notes representing any plan loans
      outstanding and not in default to the Retained Employee under Seller's DC
      Plan on the date of the direct rollover, and Buyer, the Companies and
      Seller will cooperate with each other to enable such direct rollovers to
      occur before such loans become defaulted. Seller agrees not to place any
      such loans in default for at least 90 days following the Cut-Off Date.

            (iii) If a Retained Employee is making contributions to Seller's DC
      Plan which are eligible for matching contributions by Seller immediately
      before the Effective Time, such Retained Employee shall be eligible for
      matching contributions under Buyer's DC Plan if such Retained Employee
      elects to participate in Buyer's DC Plan and Buyer (based on the advice of
      legal counsel) reasonably determines that such Retained Employee can be
      eligible for such matching contributions without jeopardizing the
      qualified status of Buyer's DC Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.

            (k) Retained Company and Seller Plans. Seller will retain any and
all liabilities and obligations with respect to benefits payable to or with
respect to any individual under the Company Plans and Seller Plans and other
employee benefit policies and practices of Seller except to the extent that such
liabilities and obligations are expressly assumed by Buyer, the Companies or any
Buyer Plan under this Section 7.3.

            (l) Workers' Compensation Liabilities. As of the Effective Time,
Buyer will cause the Companies to assume (or reimburse Seller and the other
Seller Affiliates for) all liabilities and obligations relating to compensation
and benefits under any state workers' compensation or similar law payable
following the Effective Time to or with respect to any Retained Employee, or to
any former employee of the Business, who in either case was engaged in the
Business on the date the claim arose or the incident on which the claim is based
occurred.

                                       53
<PAGE>

            (m) Credit Union. Buyer shall permit the credit union located on the
premises at 750 Lakeshore Parkway, Birmingham, Alabama 35211 to maintain its
operations consistent with past practice, including by allowing the credit union
to continue to occupy its current space in such facility and allowing employees
of Seller to transact business with the credit union for twelve (12) months
after Closing or until Seller or its Affiliate no longer continues to lease the
space from Buyer in such premises which Seller or its Affiliate is leasing at
the Effective Time, whichever comes first.

            (n) No Third Party Beneficiaries. Without limiting the generality of
Section 12.5(b), none of the preceding subsections of this Section 7.3 shall
confer any rights or remedies upon any employee or former employee of Seller,
the Companies or Buyer, any Retained Employee or upon any other Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

            Section 7.4 Securities Law Legends. Buyer agrees and understands
that the Shares have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities
Act or the securities laws of any state and that the Shares may be sold or
disposed of only in one or more transactions registered under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws or as to which an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities
laws is available. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that no Person has any right to
require Seller to cause the registration of any of the Shares. The certificates,
if any, representing the Shares shall contain a legend substantially similar to
the following and other legends necessary or appropriate under applicable state
securities laws:

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE "ACT") OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY NOT BE
SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF UNLESS A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER
THE ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SHARES IS
EFFECTIVE OR UNLESS THE COMPANY IS IN RECEIPT OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
SATISFACTORY TO IT TO THE EFFECT THAT SUCH SHARES MAY BE SOLD WITHOUT
REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT AND SUCH LAWS.

            Section 7.5 Insurance; Risk of Loss. Seller will, or will cause the
Companies to, keep insurance policies currently maintained by Seller or the
Companies, or suitable replacements therefor, in full force and effect through
the close of business on the Closing Date, and Buyer shall become solely
responsible for all insurance coverage after the Closing Date with respect to
the Business. All proceeds of insurance that may be collected by Seller (in
excess of any deductible, retention or self-insurance amount) in respect of any
damage to the properties or assets of any Company that occurs on or before the
Cut-Off Date shall (a) be retained by Seller to the extent Seller has repaired,
restored or paid for such damage, or (b) be paid over to Buyer at or following
the Closing to the extent Seller has not repaired, restored or paid for such
damage. Provided that Seller complies with Seller's obligations under this
Section 7.5, neither the occurrence of any casualty damage nor the payment,
receipt or collection of insurance proceeds shall be included or accounted for
in any way under the provisions of Section 2.4 or in the determination of Final
Working Capital. To the extent that after the Closing any party hereto

                                       54
<PAGE>

requires any information from the other party hereto in order to make any
filings with insurance carriers or insurance regulators, the other party will
promptly supply such information.

            Section 7.6 Consents. Buyer acknowledges that (i) certain consents
(including consents contingent on the fulfillment of certain conditions),
approvals, waivers, agreements, or actions of, or (with or without lapse of
time) notice to, third parties relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be required under instruments, contracts, commitments, agreements
or arrangements (the "Required Consents"), which Required Consents have not been
obtained or are themselves subject to conditions not fulfilled as of the
Closing, and (ii) certain new governmental franchises, approvals, permits,
licenses, orders, registrations, certificates, variances and similar rights may
be required in order for Buyer to conduct the Business following the Closing in
the same manner in which the Business was conducted before the Closing. Except
as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 7.6, and subject to compliance
with Section 6.3, Seller shall not have any liability whatsoever to Buyer
arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any Required Consents or any
such governmental franchises, approvals, permits, licenses, orders,
registrations, certificates, variances, or similar rights that may be required.
Subject to Seller's compliance with Section 6.3 and this Section 7.6, no
representation, warranty or covenant of Seller contained herein shall be
breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall be deemed not satisfied,
based on (A) the failure to obtain any such Required Consents or any such
governmental franchises, approvals, permits licenses, orders, registrations,
certificates, variances or similar rights, or (B) any lawsuit, action, claim,
proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any
Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such Required
Consents or any such governmental franchises, approvals, permits, licenses,
orders, registrations, certificates, variances or similar rights; provided,
however, that nothing stated herein shall supersede the conditions set forth in
Sections 8.2 and 8.3 or the obligations of Seller under Section 6.3 or this
Section 7.6. At the request of Buyer, Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, and cooperate with Buyer in any reasonable manner
in connection with Buyer obtaining, any Required Consents and any governmental
franchises, approvals, permits, licenses, orders, registrations, certificates,
variances or similar rights; provided, however, that such action shall not
include any requirement of Seller or any of its Affiliates to commence or
participate in any litigation, make any payments or offer or grant any
accommodation or undertake any liability or obligation (in each case financial
or otherwise) to any third party (including any Governmental Body), unless in
the case of any cost or expense incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates,
Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for such cost or expense arising from any
action by Seller or such Affiliate requested by Buyer.

            Section 7.7 Fees and Expenses. Except as provided in Section 7.2 or
in this Section 7.7 or as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial
advisors and accountants, shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and
expenses; provided, however, that all expenses incurred in connection with
obtaining updated title commitments shall be paid by Buyer.

            Section 7.8 Gift Cards, Etc; Return Policies. Following the Cut-Off
Date, without recourse to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Companies), Buyer shall manage

                                       55
<PAGE>

and honor, in accordance with their respective terms, all gift certificates,
gift cards, merchandise vouchers, coupons and refunds purchased, issued or
earned in connection with the Business on or before the Cut-Off Date. For the
120-day period following the Cut-Off Date, Buyer shall honor all return policies
of the Business with respect to products sold in connection with the conduct of
the Business on or before the Cut-Off Date, without recourse to Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than the Companies).

            Section 7.9 HIPAA Confidentiality. Buyer shall enter into such
confidentiality agreements with respect to all books and records of Seller
relating to the Retained Employees as may be required under the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder ("HIPAA"). Seller may withhold from Buyer any
portions of such books and records that contain protected health information on
Retained Employees or their dependents to the extent Seller reasonably
determines based on advice of counsel that disclosure of such information to
Buyer would violate HIPAA. Seller will cooperate with Buyer to the extent that,
in connection with making offers of employment to Business Employees, Buyer
seeks any release of records from any Business Employee as may be required under
HIPAA.

            Section 7.10 Non-Solicitation of Employees.

            (a) Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall (i) for a period
of one year from the Cut-Off Date, solicit the services, as employee, consultant
or otherwise, (or cause or seek to cause to leave the employ of Buyer or any of
its subsidiaries) any Retained Employee or (ii) for a period of two years from
the Cut-Off Date, solicit the services, as employee, consultant or otherwise (or
cause or seek to cause to leave the employ of Buyer or any of its subsidiaries)
any Retained Employee at or above the level of store manager in the Business;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply (x) with respect to any
Retained Employee as to whom conversations were initiated by such Retained
Employee after such Retained Employee was discharged from or resigned employment
with Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or (y) with respect to any public
advertisement or general solicitation (or any hiring pursuant thereto) that is
not specifically targeted at Retained Employees. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees
to cooperate with the other party to correct any inadvertent breach of this
Section 7.10(a) by Seller or any of its Affiliates.

            (b) Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall (i) for a period

its subsidiaries) any of Seller's or its subsidiaries' employees or (ii) for a
period of two years from the Cut-Off Date, solicit the services, as employee,
consultant or otherwise (or cause or seek to cause to leave the employ of Seller
or any of its subsidiaries), any of the Seller's or its subsidiaries' employees
at or above the level of store manager; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not apply (x) with respect to any employee as to whom conversations were
initiated by such employee after such employee was discharged from or resigned
employment with Seller or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, or (y)
with respect to any public advertisement or general solicitation (or any hiring
pursuant thereto) that is not specifically targeted at such employees. Each of
Buyer and Seller

                                       56
<PAGE>

agrees to cooperate with the other party to correct any inadvertent breach of
this Section 7.10(b) by Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

            Section 7.11 Certain Litigation. Following the Closing, Buyer shall
comply with the obligations set forth in item 3 of Schedule 4.13 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule.

            Section 7.12 Supplemental Quarterly Financial Statements.

            (a) Seller shall deliver to Buyer within 60 days after July 29, 2006
the unaudited balance sheet of the Business as of July 29, 2006 and the related
unaudited statement of income of the Business for the three-month period then
ended. Each of Seller and Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it is their
intention for such supplemental quarterly information to be prepared in
accordance with (A) GAAP on a basis consistent with the principles historically
applied by Seller and (B) the requirements of Regulation S-X.

            (b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to give to Buyer and any of its Affiliates such assistance as shall
reasonably be requested by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in connection with any
private placement or any registration or registered offering of any security or
any periodic report required by applicable Requirements of Law. Any
out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller in connection with the foregoing shall
promptly be reimbursed by Buyer.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

true and correct on the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date (or on
the date when made in the case of any representation or warranty which
specifically relates to an earlier date), except for (a) changes or transactions
therein permitted by this Agreement or resulting from any change or transaction
consented to in writing by Buyer and (b) failures of representations and
warranties to be true and correct which, individually or in the aggregate, are

                                INDEMNIFICATION

            Section 10.1 Indemnification by Seller. (a) From and after the
Closing, Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Group Member
from and against any and all Losses and Expenses incurred by such Buyer Group
Member in connection with or arising from:

            (i) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any
      representation of Seller contained in this Agreement or the certificate
      delivered by or on behalf of Seller pursuant to Section 8.5 (for purposes
      of this Section 10.1(a)(i), other than with respect to Sections 4.20 and
      4.23, such representations and warranties shall be read without reference
      to qualifications as to materiality, including the words "material" and
      "Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein);

            (ii) any breach by Seller of, or failure by Seller to perform, any
      of its covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement;

            (iii) the matters set forth as item 4 of Schedule 4.9(c) and items
      2, 4 and 5 of Schedule 4.13 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule; and

            (iv) any litigation, arbitration, administrative or other
      proceedings, pending or threatened against the Companies arising out of
      any occurrence or event prior to the Effective Time to the extent that
      such litigation, arbitration, administrative or other proceeding does not
      arise out of or relate to the Business or any of the assets of the
      Business.

provided, however, that Seller shall be required to indemnify and hold harmless
each Buyer Group Member under Section 10.1(a)(i) with respect to Losses and
Expenses incurred only to the extent that:

            (x) the amount of Loss and Expense suffered by Buyer Group Members
      related to each individual claim exceeds $25,000 (in which event, subject
      to clauses (y) and (z) below, Seller shall indemnify Buyer for the full
      amount of such Loss and Expense (including the initial $25,000));

            (y) the aggregate amount of such Losses and Expenses (other than
      Losses and Expenses excluded by clause (x) above) exceeds one and
      six-tenths percent (1.6%) of the Purchase Price (it being understood that
      such amount shall be a deductible for which Seller shall bear no
      indemnification responsibility); and

            (z) the aggregate amount required to be paid by Seller pursuant to
      Section 10.1(a)(i) shall not exceed nine and six-tenths percent (9.6%) of
      the Purchase Price.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the limitations set forth in
clauses (x), (y) and (z) above shall apply with respect to Seller's
indemnification obligations relating to Section 4.4(a).

                                       59
<PAGE>

            (b) The indemnification provided for in Section 10.1(a) shall
terminate twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (and no claims shall be made
by any Buyer Group Member under Section 10.1(a) thereafter), except that the
indemnification by Seller shall continue as to:

            (i) the covenants of Seller set forth in Sections 7.10 and 12.6,
      which shall survive for 180 days following the periods of time set forth
      in such sections;

            (ii) the representation set forth in Section 4.4(a) and the
      covenants of Seller set forth in Article II, Sections 7.2, 7.3, 7.5, 7.6,
      7.7, 7.9 and 12.12, which shall survive until the expiration of the
      relevant statutory period of limitations applicable to the underlying
      claim, giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof; and

            (iii) any Losses or Expenses of which any Buyer Group Member has
      validly given a Claim Notice to Seller in accordance with the requirements
      of Section 10.3 on or prior to the date such indemnification would
      otherwise terminate in accordance with this Section 10.1(b), as to which
      the obligation of Seller shall continue solely with respect to the
      specific matters in such Claim Notice until the liability of Seller shall
      have been determined pursuant to this Article X, and Seller shall have
      reimbursed all Buyer Group Members for the full amount of such Losses and
      Expenses that are payable with respect to such Claim Notice in accordance
      with this Article X.

            Section 10.2 Indemnification by Buyer. (a) From and after the
Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Group Member
from and against any and all Losses and Expenses incurred by such Seller Group
Member in connection with or arising from:

            (i) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any
      representation of Buyer contained in this Agreement or the certificate
      delivered by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant to Section 9.5 (for purposes
      of this Section 10.2(a)(i), such representations and warranties shall be
      read without reference to qualifications as to materiality, including the
      words "material" and "Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein);

            (ii) any breach by Buyer of, or failure by Buyer to perform, any of
      its covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement;

            (iii) the Assumed Contract Liabilities; and

            (iv) any liability or obligation arising out of or relating to the
      Business (other than those items for which Buyer is entitled to
      indemnification from Seller under Section 10.1(a)).

provided, however, that Buyer shall be required to indemnify and hold harmless
under Section 10.2(a)(i) with respect to Losses and Expenses incurred by Seller
Group Members only to the extent that:

            (x) the amount of Loss and Expense suffered by Seller Group Members
related to each individual claim exceeds $25,000 (in which event, subject to
clauses (y) and (z)

                                       60
<PAGE>

below, Buyer shall indemnify Seller for the full amount of such Loss and Expense
(including the initial $25,000));

            (y) the aggregate amount of such Losses and Expenses (other than
Losses and Expenses excluded by clause (x) above) exceeds one and six-tenths
percent (1.6%) of the Purchase Price (it being understood that such amount shall
be a deductible for which Buyer shall bear no indemnification responsibility);
and

            (z) the aggregate amount required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to
Section 10.2(a)(i) shall not exceed nine and six-tenths percent (9.6%) of the
Purchase Price.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the limitations set forth in
clauses (x), (y) and (z) above shall apply with respect to Buyer's
indemnification obligations relating to Section 5.2(a).

            (b) The indemnification provided for in Section 10.2(a) shall
terminate twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (and no claims shall be made
by any Seller Group Member under Section 10.2(a) thereafter), except that the
indemnification by Buyer shall continue as to:

            (i) the covenants of Buyer set forth in Section 12.6, which shall
      survive for 180 days following the periods of time set forth in such
      sections;

            (ii) the representation set forth in Section 5.2(a), the covenants
      of Buyer set forth in Article II, Sections 6.7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.6, 7.7,
      7.8, 7.9, 7.11 and 12.12 which shall survive until the expiration of the
      relevant statutory period of limitations applicable to the underlying
      claim, giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof;

            (iii) the obligations of Buyer pursuant to Sections 10.2(a)(iii) and
      10.2(a)(iv), which shall survive indefinitely; and

            (iv) any Losses or Expenses of which any Seller Group Member has
      validly given a Claim Notice to Buyer in accordance with the requirements
      of Section 10.3 on or prior to the date such indemnification would
      otherwise terminate in accordance with this Section 10.2(b), as to which
      the obligation of Buyer shall continue solely with respect to the specific
      matters in such Claim Notice until the liability of Buyer shall have been
      determined pursuant to this Article X, and Buyer shall have reimbursed all
      Seller Group Members for the full amount of such Losses and Expenses that
      are payable with respect to such Claim Notice in accordance with this
      Article X.

            Section 10.3 Notice of Claims. Any Buyer Group Member or Seller
Group Member seeking indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") shall
give promptly to the party obligated to provide indemnification to such
Indemnified Party (the "Indemnitor") a notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification
hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or
the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the
provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument
executed hereunder or in connection

                                       61
<PAGE>

herewith upon which such claim is based; provided, however, that a Claim Notice
in respect of any action at law or suit in equity by or against a third Person
as to which indemnification will be sought shall be given promptly after the
action or suit is commenced.

            Section 10.4 Determination of Amount. (a) In calculating any Loss or
Expense there shall be deducted any insurance recovery in respect thereof (and
no right of subrogation shall accrue hereunder to any insurer). Each party
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to make any such insurance
recovery. Buyer and Seller agree that, for purposes of computing the amount of
any indemnification payment under this Article X, any such indemnification
payment shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes. If Seller is required to indemnify a Buyer Group Member pursuant to
the provisions of Section 10.1, and the cost, expense or liability for which the
indemnification is sought under Section 10.1 has provided any Buyer Group Member
with a Tax benefit actually saved or recovered, the amount of such Tax benefit
that has been realized or received, after taking into consideration all costs
and expenses incurred in obtaining such Tax savings, shall reduce Seller's
liability to indemnify a Buyer Group Member under Section 10.1.

            (b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant to Section 10.3,
the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled
under this Article X shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of
any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a
court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired
and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been
finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof in
establishing the amount of Losses and Expenses suffered by it.

            Section 10.5 Third Person Claims. (a) Any party seeking
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of
or involving a claim or demand made by any third Person against the Indemnified
Party shall notify the Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the
third Person claim within five business days after receipt by such Indemnified
Party of written notice of the third Person claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified
Party shall deliver to the Indemnitor, within 10 business days after the
Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the third
Person claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should a party be physically served
with a complaint with regard to a third Person claim, the Indemnified Party
shall notify the Indemnitor with a copy of the complaint within five business
days after receipt thereof and shall deliver to the Indemnitor within seven
business days after the receipt of such complaint copies of notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to
the third Person claim. The failure to give notice as provided in this Section
10.5 shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the
extent it shall have been prejudiced by such failure.

            (b) In the event any legal proceeding shall be threatened or
instituted or any claim or demand shall be asserted by any Person in respect of
which payment may be sought by one party hereto from the other party under the
provisions of this Article X, the Indemnified

                                       62
<PAGE>

Party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any such claim of
which it has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the
Indemnitor. Any notice of a claim by reason of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement shall contain a reference to
the provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument
executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based, the
facts giving rise to an alleged basis for the claim and the amount of the
liability asserted against the Indemnitor by reason of the claim. In the event
of the initiation of any legal proceeding against the Indemnified Party by a
third Person, the Indemnitor shall have the sole and absolute right after the
receipt of notice, at its option and at its own expense, to be represented by
counsel of its choice and to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any proceeding, claim, or demand which relates to any loss,
liability or damage indemnified against hereunder; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party may participate in any such proceeding with counsel of its
choice and at its expense. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each
other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such
legal proceeding, claim or demand. To the extent the Indemnitor elects not to
defend such proceeding, claim or demand, and the Indemnified Party defends
against or otherwise deals with any such proceeding, claim or demand, the
Indemnified Party may retain counsel, at the expense of the Indemnitor, and
control the defense of such proceeding. Neither the Indemnitor nor the
Indemnified Party may settle any such proceeding which settlement obligates the
other party to pay money, to perform obligations or to admit liability without
the consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld;
provided, that, if the Indemnitor wishes to settle any such proceeding and the
Indemnified Party does not consent to such settlement, the Indemnitor shall not
have any liability or obligation in excess of the proposed settlement amount.
After any final judgment or award shall have been rendered by a court,
arbitration board or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and the
time in which to appeal therefrom has expired, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall arrive at a
mutually binding agreement with respect to each separate matter alleged to be
indemnified by the Indemnitor hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to
the Indemnitor notice of any sums due and owing by it with respect to such
matter and the Indemnitor shall pay all of the sums so owing to the Indemnified
Party by wire transfer, certified or bank cashier's check within 30 days after
the date of such notice.

            (c) To the extent of any inconsistency between this Section 10.5 and
Section 7.2(c) (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of Section 7.2(c)
shall control with respect to Tax contests.

            Section 10.6 Limitations. (a) In any case where an Indemnified Party
recovers from third Persons any amount in respect of a matter with respect to
which an Indemnitor has indemnified it pursuant to this Article X, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount so
recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by
it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount
previously so paid by the Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in
respect of such matter and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnitor in
pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter.

                                       63
<PAGE>

            (b) EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH THIRD-PERSON CLAIMS, IN NO EVENT SHALL
ANY PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS
OF REVENUES OR PROFITS), EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ARISING UNDER ANY LEGAL
OR EQUITABLE THEORY, ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ALL OF
WHICH ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED BY AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR
NOT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

            (c) Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law and
injunctive and provisional relief (including, but not limited to, specific
performance), if the Closing occurs, this Article X shall be the exclusive
remedy of the parties hereto for breaches of this Agreement (including any
covenant, obligation, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement) or otherwise in respect
of the sale of the Shares contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action of such party
against the other party arising under this Agreement or under any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement as a matter of equity or under or based
upon any federal, state, provincial, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance,
rule or regulation (including those relating to Environmental Laws) or arising
under or based upon common law or otherwise, except that this Section 10.6(c)
shall not limit the remedies of a party with respect to a claim based on fraud.

            Section 10.7 Mitigation. Each of the parties agrees to take all
reasonable steps to mitigate their respective Losses and Expenses upon and after
becoming aware of any event or condition which could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any Losses and Expenses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                                   TERMINATION

            Section 11.1 Termination. Anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing Date:

            (a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

            (b) by Seller upon 15 business days' notice to Buyer if any of the
conditions in Article IX shall have become incapable of fulfillment at the
Closing, and shall not have been waived in writing by Seller; provided, that,
Seller's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1(b)
shall not be available to Seller if Seller's failure to fulfill any of its
obligations contained in this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in,
the failure of the conditions of Article IX to be capable of fulfillment at the
Closing;

            (c) by Buyer upon 15 business days' notice to Seller if any of the
conditions in Article VIII shall have become incapable of fulfillment at the
Closing, and shall not have been

                                       64
<PAGE>

waived in writing by Buyer; provided, that, Buyer's right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1(c) shall not be available to Buyer if
Buyer's failure to fulfill any of its obligations contained in this Agreement
has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the conditions of Article
VIII to be capable of fulfillment at the Closing;

            (d) by Buyer or Seller if any court or other Governmental Body
having jurisdiction over Buyer or Seller shall have issued a final and
non-appealable order, decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the purchase and sale of the Shares; or

            (e) by Buyer or Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before November 27, 2006 (or such later date as may be agreed to in writing to
Buyer and Seller); provided, however, that either party may by written notice to
the other party delivered on or before November 27, 2006 extend such date until
any date prior to April 2, 2007 if the failure of the Closing to have occurred
on or before November 27, 2006 shall have resulted from the failure of the
condition set forth in Sections 8.1 and 9.1; provided, further, that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1(e) shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any of its obligations contained
in this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to have occurred on or prior to the aforesaid dates.

            Section 11.2 Notice of Termination. Any party desiring to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1 shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party to this Agreement.

            Section 11.3 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to this Article XI, all further obligations of the parties under this
Agreement shall terminate without any liability to the other party (other than
this Section 11.3 (Effect of Termination), Section 7.7 (Fees and Expenses), and
Article XII (Miscellaneous), which provisions shall each survive such
termination; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 11.3 shall relieve
any party from any liability for a willful breach of this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE XII

warranties shall terminate and the parties shall have no rights or remedies
thereafter with respect to any breach of such representations or warranties.

            Section 12.2 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflicts of

without the approval of the other, make any press release or other public
announcement concerning the

                                       65

however, that the foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures
necessary to implement the provisions of this Agreement or to comply with SEC
disclosure obligations or the rules of any United States or foreign stock

            Section 12.8 Interpretation. Articles, titles and headings to
sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The schedules and exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with
and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set
forth verbatim herein. Disclosure of any fact or item in any schedule hereto
referenced by a particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have
been disclosed with respect to every other section in this Agreement. Neither
the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any
schedule hereto is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and no
party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the
inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as
to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in
any Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Unless this
Agreement specifically provides otherwise, neither the specification of any item
or matter in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply that
such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary
course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the
inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the
parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or
included in any schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business for
purposes of this Agreement. Seller may, from time to time prior to or at the
Closing, by notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, supplement,
amend or create any schedule, in order to add information or correct previously
supplied information. No such amendment shall be evidence, in and of itself,
that the representations and warranties in the corresponding section are no
longer true and correct in all material respects. It is specifically agreed that
such schedules may be amended to add immaterial, as well as material, items
thereto. No such supplemental, amended or additional schedule shall be deemed to
cure any breach for purposes of Section 8.3, unless Buyer does not object to
such supplemental, amended or additional schedule within five business days
after receipt thereof.

            Section 12.9 Waivers. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party,
it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The
failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any
way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of
any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any
breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach.

            Section 12.10 Partial Invalidity. Wherever possible, each provision
hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating
the remainder of

                                       68
<PAGE>

such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other
provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be unreasonable.

            Section 12.11 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an
original instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to Seller and Buyer.

            Section 12.12 Further Assurances. On and after the Closing Date each
party hereto shall take such other actions and execute such other documents and
instruments of conveyance and transfer as may be reasonably requested by the
other party hereto from time to time to effectuate or confirm the transfer of
the Shares to Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, on and after the Closing Date, at the
request of Seller, Buyer and its Affiliates (including for purposes of this
Section 12.12, the Companies) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
transfer to Seller and its Affiliates (i) any assets of the Companies that do
not arise out of or relate to the Business, (ii) any assets relating primarily
to the operation of the Club Libby Lu business and (iii) all Contracts that
relate to businesses of Seller other than the Business (except for the Assigned
Contracts).

            Section 12.13 Disclaimer of Warranties. Seller makes no
representations or warranties with respect to any projections, forecasts or
forward-looking information provided to Buyer. There is no assurance that any
projected or forecasted results will be achieved. EXCEPT AS TO THOSE MATTERS
EXPRESSLY COVERED BY THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE CERTIFICATE DELIVERED BY SELLER PURSUANT TO SECTION 3.4(d), SELLER IS
SELLING THE SHARES (AND THE BUSINESS AND ASSETS OF THE COMPANIES REPRESENTED
THEREBY) ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND SELLER DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER
WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTEES WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. SELLER
MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO FITNESS, NONINFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES
WHATSOEVER. Buyer acknowledges that neither Seller nor any of its
representatives or any other Person has made any representation or warranty,
express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any memoranda, charts
or summaries heretofore made available by Seller or its representatives to Buyer
or any other information which is not included in this Agreement or the
schedules hereto, and neither Seller nor any of its representatives or any other
Person will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer
or any other Person resulting from the distribution of any such information to,
or use of any such information by, Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any of their
agents, consultants, accountants, counsel or other representatives.

            Section 12.14 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United

States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

            Section 12.15 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto waives the
right to a trial by jury in any litigation, proceeding or other legal action in
connection with or relating to this Agreement, any Seller Ancillary Agreement or

                          TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

            This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of
[ ], 2006 and effective as of [ ], 2006 (the "Effective Date"), is made by and
between [ ] Incorporated, a [ ] corporation ("Seller"), and [ ] a [ ]
corporation ("Buyer").

                                    RECITALS

            WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as
of [ ], 2006, by and between Seller and Buyer (the "Purchase Agreement"), Seller
has agreed to sell, or cause to be sold, to Buyer the Shares, and Buyer has
agreed to purchase the Shares as provided therein; and

            WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement, Buyer and Seller desire that Seller provide Buyer with
certain transition services relating to the Business as set forth in this
Agreement.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

            1. TRANSITION SERVICES.

            (a) During the term of this Agreement as set forth in Section 7 (the
"Transition Period"), and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
Seller shall provide, or cause one or more of its Affiliates to provide, to
Buyer (with respect to the Business) each of the services specified on Annex A
hereto (each of the nine (9) categories described on Annex A, a "Service" and,
collectively, the "Services") from the Effective Date and for the specific
period of time described on Annex A with respect to each such Service, which
shall be provided in a manner consistent in all material respects with that
provided by Seller or one or more of its Affiliates to the Business during the
twelve (12) month period immediately prior to the Effective Date. Buyer shall
purchase and pay for such Services as provided for herein. The quantity of each
Service shall be that which Buyer reasonably requires for the operation of the
Business in the ordinary course consistent in all material respects with the
operation of the Business during the twelve (12) month period immediately prior
to the Effective Date. The Services shall only be made available for, and Buyer
shall only be entitled to utilize the Services for the benefit of the stores
operated by or in development by the Companies immediately prior to the
Effective Date. Annex B hereto contains a description of each of the Services
specified on Annex A.

            (b) The fees payable by Buyer to Seller for each Service are set
forth on Annex A and are substantially consistent with the costs allocated by
Seller to the Business during the 12 month period immediately prior to the
Effective Date; provided, that, if, after the Effective Date, Seller upgrades or
otherwise changes any of the Services provided to its Affiliates, Seller shall
provide Buyer with prior written notice at least 30 days prior to such upgrade
or change to any Services. Seller

<PAGE>

shall offer such upgraded or changed Service to Buyer for a fee at a rate equal
to the fee rate Seller charges its Affiliates for such upgraded or changed
Service, and Annex A shall be amended to reflect such fees. Buyer acknowledges
that some of the Services to be provided hereunder require instructions and
information from Buyer, which Buyer shall provide to Seller in sufficient time
for Seller or its Affiliates to provide or procure such Services. Buyer shall
pay any additional costs or expenses resulting from any failure of Buyer to
provide such instructions or information.

            (c) The parties shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of any licensors of Software or any other third
party that may be required in connection with the provision of any of the
Services hereunder; provided, however, that Seller shall have no obligation to
pay money or grant any accommodation to any third party in order to obtain any
such consents, except to the extent Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for any
such payment made by Seller at the request of Buyer. If any such third party
requires a payment in order to make the Services available to Buyer hereunder,
each party shall promptly notify the other party of this additional cost and the
parties shall discuss any viable work-around solution. In any such case, Buyer
shall have the option to elect (i) to pay any amounts that are required to be
paid to any third party to obtain the consent of such third party in order to
receive the Services hereunder or (ii) to terminate any of the Services
associated with the required consent. Under the circumstances contemplated by
clause (ii) of this Section 1(c), Buyer shall not be required to pay the monthly
residual cost contemplated by Section 7(e).

            (d) With respect to any error or defect in the provision of any
Services, Seller will, at Buyer's request and to the extent practicable, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to correct such error or defect or re-perform
such Services as promptly as practicable without the payment of any further fees
with respect to such defective Services.

            (e) On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of each month during the
term of this Agreement, Seller will prepare and deliver to Buyer one or more
reports reflecting the performance of Seller with respect to the target metrics
set forth in Annex C (the "Target Performance Metrics") during the immediately
preceding month. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, such
report or reports shall be provided for informational purposes only and, except
as otherwise expressly provided herein, Seller shall incur no liability for any
failure to meet such Target Performance Metrics.

            2. LIMITATION ON SERVICES. Except as provided in Section 1(b),
Seller shall have no obligation to upgrade, enhance or otherwise modify any
computer hardware, Software or network environment currently used in the
Business or to provide any support or maintenance services for any computer
hardware, Software or network environment that has been upgraded, enhanced or
otherwise modified from the computer hardware, Software or network environments
that is currently used in the Business.

            3. ADDITIONAL SERVICES. If Buyer reasonably determines that
additional transition services of the type previously provided by Seller to the
Business ("Additional Services") are necessary to complete the transition,
Seller will consider in good faith providing such services to Buyer.
Representatives of Seller and Buyer will meet to discuss the terms and

                                       -2-
<PAGE>

conditions (including cost) upon which such Additional Services will be
provided. Any such Additional Services mutually agreed to and the fees thereof
shall be effective as of the date of execution of an amendment to this Agreement
by duly authorized representatives of the parties hereto. It is understood and
agreed that Seller shall be under no obligation to provide or procure any such
Additional Services requested by Buyer.

            4. SUBCONTRACTORS. Seller may, directly or through one or more
Affiliates, hire or engage one or more subcontractors or other third parties
(each, a "Subcontractor") to perform any or all of its obligations under this
Agreement; provided, that: (a) Seller remains ultimately responsible for
ensuring that the obligations with respect to the nature, quality and standards
of care set forth in Section 1 are satisfied with respect to any Service
provided by any Subcontractor; (b) the use of any Subcontractor will not
increase any fees payable by Buyer hereunder; (c) the use of any Subcontractor
will not adversely affect the quality or timeliness of delivery of any Service
provided to Buyer and (d) if Seller plans to use any company primarily engaged
in the operation of retail department stores as a Subcontractor for particular
Services pursuant to this Section 4, Seller shall provide Buyer with thirty (30)
days' prior written notice of its intent to use such Subcontractor and Buyer
may, in its sole discretion, elect to terminate those Services rendered by such
Subcontractor pursuant to Section 8.

            5. TITLE TO SELLER EQUIPMENT; MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL.

            (a) All procedures, methods, systems, strategies, tools, equipment,
facilities and other resources (except for the assets of the Business and any
other procedures, methods, systems, strategies, tools, equipment, facilities and
other resources owned by Buyer) used by Seller, any of its Affiliates or any
Subcontractor in connection with the provision of Services hereunder
(collectively, the "Seller Equipment") shall remain the property of Seller, its
Affiliates or such Subcontractor and, except as otherwise provided herein, shall
at all times be under the sole direction and control of Seller, its Affiliates
or such Subcontractor.

            (b) Except as otherwise provided herein, management of, and control
over, the provision of the Services (including the determination or designation
at any time of the Seller Equipment, employees and other resources of Seller,
its Affiliates or any Subcontractor to be used in connection with the provision
of the Services) shall reside solely with Seller. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, all labor matters relating to any employees of
Seller, its Affiliates and any Subcontractor shall be within the exclusive
control of such parties, and Buyer shall take no action affecting, or have any
rights with respect to, such matters. Seller shall be solely responsible for the
payment of all salary and benefits and all income tax, social security taxes,
unemployment compensation, tax, workers' compensation tax, other employment
taxes or withholdings and premiums and remittances with respect to employees of
Seller and its Affiliates used to provide Services.

            (c) In connection with any obligations of Seller or any of its
Affiliates to a third party, Seller shall not permit any lien or other
encumbrance to be placed upon any assets or other materials owned by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates that are transported, shipped, warehoused or otherwise
held in the custody of Seller or any of its Affiliates on behalf of Buyer.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

            6. BILLING AND PAYMENT.

            (a) Buyer shall promptly pay any bills and invoices that it receives
from Seller or any of its Affiliates for Services provided under this Agreement,
subject to receiving, if requested, any appropriate support documentation for
such bills and invoices. Such charges shall be billed at the end of each
calendar month. Unless otherwise provided herein or on Annex A, Buyer shall pay
all invoices by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with
the instructions provided by Seller or any of its Affiliates (in writing to
Buyer), as applicable, not later than fifteen (15) days following receipt by
Buyer of Seller's or any of its Affiliates' invoice. Buyer shall not offset any
amounts owing to it by Seller or any of Seller's Affiliates against amounts
payable by Buyer hereunder or under any other agreement or arrangement. Should
Buyer dispute any portion of any invoice, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in
writing of the nature and basis of the dispute.

            (b) If Buyer fails to pay the full amount of any invoice (except to
the extent of any invoiced amounts reasonably disputed by Buyer in good faith
and of which dispute Buyer has notified Seller in accordance with the
requirements of this Agreement) within thirty (30) days after the relevant
payment date, such failure shall be considered a material breach of this
Agreement and if at any time the aggregate amount of such overdue unpaid
invoices (except to the extent of any invoiced amounts reasonably disputed by
Buyer in good faith and of which dispute Buyer has notified Seller in accordance
with the requirements of this Agreement) exceeds $250,000, Seller may, without
liability, suspend its obligations hereunder to provide any and all of the
Services to Buyer until such time as such invoices have been paid in full
(except to the extent of any invoiced amounts reasonably disputed by Buyer in
good faith and of which dispute Buyer has notified Seller in accordance with the
requirements of this Agreement). The remedy provided to Seller by this Section
6(b) shall be without limitation of any other applicable provisions of this
Agreement, including Sections 6(d) and 7.

            (c) All charges and fees to be paid by Buyer to Seller and its
Affiliates under this Agreement are exclusive of any applicable taxes required
by law to be collected from Buyer (including withholding, sales, use, excise or
services taxes, which may be assessed on the provision of the Services
hereunder). If a withholding, sales, use, excise or services tax is assessed on
the provision of any of the Services provided under this Agreement, Buyer shall
pay directly, reimburse or indemnify Seller and its Affiliates for such tax. The
parties shall cooperate with each other in determining the extent to which any
tax is due and owing under the circumstances, and shall provide and make
available to each other any resale certificate, information regarding
out-of-state use of materials, services or sale, and other exemption
certificates or information reasonably requested by the other party.

            (d) All payments required to be made pursuant to this Agreement
shall bear interest from and including the date fifteen (15) days after such
payment is due to but excluding the date of payment at an annual rate equal to
the average daily one-month LIBOR rate in effect during the period, plus 150
basis points (except to the extent of any invoiced amounts reasonably disputed
by Buyer in good faith in accordance with this Agreement, in which case no late
fee shall be payable by Buyer in respect of any portion of such disputed amount
resolved in Buyer's favor). Such interest shall be payable at the same time as
the payment to which it relates.

                                       -4-
<PAGE>

            (e) Throughout the Transition Period and for one year thereafter, no
more than once during each six month period, Seller shall, subject to Seller's
site safety, confidentiality and security procedures, provide to such auditors
(including third-party auditors and Buyer's internal audit staff) as Buyer may
designate in writing, access to: (i) any facility at which the Services are
being performed; (ii) appropriate Seller management personnel and
Subcontractors; and (iii) the data and records (and other documentation
reasonably requested by Buyer) maintained by Seller with respect to the Services
solely for the purpose of: (A) performing its tax filings and reports, end of
the month, end of fiscal quarter and end of fiscal year financial closing
process, and to prepare the related financial statements and accounting reports,
or to revise any financial statements and accounting reports for any prior
periods; (B) performing audits and inspections of Buyer and its businesses
(including any audits necessary to enable Buyer to meet its applicable
regulatory requirements, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
("SOA")); (C) enabling Buyer's auditors to attest to and report on the
assessment of Buyer's management as to the effectiveness of its internal control
structure and procedures for financial reporting relating to the Services within
the meaning of Section 404 of the SOA; or (D) demonstrating to any third party
as reasonably necessary Buyer's compliance with applicable laws or regulations.
The scope of such audits may include, without limitation, to the extent
reasonably necessary, (x) Seller's practices and procedures, (y) the adequacy of
general controls (e.g., organizational controls, input/output controls, system
modification controls, processing controls, system design controls and access
controls) and security practices and procedures, and (z) the adequacy of
disaster recovery and back-up procedures. Any such audits will be conducted at
Buyer's expense.

            7. TERM OF AGREEMENT; TERMINATION.

            (a) This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall
continue (unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof) for the period
during which Seller is providing Services hereunder, or such shorter period as
may be specified on Annex A with respect to any particular Service. In the event
that Buyer desires to renew any Services beyond the date at which they terminate
pursuant to Section 1(a), Buyer shall notify Seller of such desire to renew any
such Services at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the initial
service period for such Services as set forth on Annex A. Buyer shall be
entitled to renew any particular Service in monthly increments for a renewal
period not to exceed 50% of the initial service period set forth on Annex A;
provided, however, that with respect to information technology Services, the
renewal period shall be identical to the initial service period. Neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to provide Services on behalf of
Buyer following the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement or any
particular Service.

            (b) Buyer may terminate this Agreement at any time upon thirty (30)
days' prior written notice to Seller in the event of a material breach of this
Agreement by Seller. If Seller cures the breach within thirty (30) days
following receipt of such notice, this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect.

            (c) Seller may terminate this Agreement at any time upon thirty (30)
days' prior written notice to Buyer in the event of a material breach of this
Agreement by Buyer. If Buyer cures the breach within thirty (30) days following
receipt of such notice, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect;
provided, that if such breach relates to the non-payment by

                                       -5-
<PAGE>

Buyer of any fees or expenses under Section 6, then termination under this
Section 7(c) shall be effective fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of
notice of breach from Seller unless all unpaid fees or expenses have been paid
in full within such 15-day period (except to the extent of any invoiced amounts
reasonably disputed by Buyer in good faith and of which dispute Buyer has
notified Seller in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement).

            (d) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller
upon a Change in Control of Seller at any time within 60 days following the
Change in Control. Any such termination shall be effective upon Seller's receipt
of Buyer's termination notice unless otherwise agreed by the parties. A "Change
in Control" means the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) any
"person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("the Exchange Act")) becomes the "beneficial
owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly,
of securities of Seller representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total
voting power represented by Seller's then outstanding voting securities; (ii)
the consummation of the sale or disposition by Seller of all or substantially
all of Seller's assets to an unaffiliated third party (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, a sale-leaseback transaction or similar financing
transaction); or (iii) the consummation of a merger or consolidation of Seller
with any other entity, other than a merger or consolidation which would result
in the voting securities of Seller outstanding immediately prior thereto
continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted
into voting securities of the surviving entity or its parent) at least fifty
percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of
Seller or such surviving entity or its parent outstanding immediately after such
merger or consolidation.

            (e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, (i) if this Agreement is terminated for any reason, Buyer shall remain
liable for the payment of fees and expenses accruing for the period prior to
termination even though such fees may not become due until after termination and
(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Seller or any particular Service is
terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section 8, Buyer shall remain liable for 50% of
the monthly fees associated with all of the Services (in the case of a
termination of the Agreement) or 50% of the monthly fees associated with any
particular Service (in the case of a partial termination pursuant to Section 8),
in each case as specified on Annex A, from the termination date through the end
of the initial service period or the renewal period, as the case may be.
Further, in the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7, Sections 5(a), 6(a), 6(c)-(d), 7, 9-11, 13, 14 and 16 through 25 shall
continue in full force and effect.

            (f) Provided that Buyer has met and continues to meet its
obligations set forth in Section 6, prior to the termination of this Agreement,
Seller shall cooperate with Buyer as reasonably requested by Buyer to effect an
orderly transition of the Services provided hereunder and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Buyer to complete the transition as promptly as
practicable. In addition, Seller will facilitate and support Buyer in the
conversion of all necessary systems from Seller's systems to Buyer's systems,
including support of the mapping and transferring of files. The parties agree to
cooperate in good faith and to use their commercially reasonable efforts to
mutually develop a conversion plan to effect the orderly transition of the
Services from Seller's systems to Buyer's systems. In connection therewith, the
parties will in good faith consider modifications to the initial service
periods. Buyer agrees to

                                       -6-
<PAGE>

pay Seller for such conversion services on the basis of Seller's direct costs,
administrative support costs and costs associated with special requests.

            8. PARTIAL TERMINATION. Subject to Section 7(e), Buyer may terminate
any or all of the Services, effective as of the last day of an accounting month
of Seller, at any time prior to the expiration of the period specified on Annex
A (including any renewal period) upon at least sixty (60) days' prior written
notice to Seller. As soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of any
such notice, Seller shall advise Buyer in writing as to whether termination of
such Services shall reasonably require the termination or partial termination
of, or otherwise affect the provision of, any other Services. If such is the
case, Buyer may withdraw its termination notice in writing within five (5) days
of being so advised by Seller. Otherwise, such termination shall be final.

            9. COST ADJUSTMENT FACTOR. The fee for each Service specified on
Annex A may be increased every six months during the Service Period to pass
along the Business's proportionate share, on the basis of the Business's
relative utilization of the affected Service(s), of increases (if any) to the
core costs (including, but not limited to payroll, utilities, health and welfare
benefits, third party service contracts and materials) of providing such
Services. Seller will provide advance notice and reasonable support
documentation to Buyer of any such fee increase.

            10. CERTAIN ADVANCE PAYMENTS. Any obligations or liabilities of
Buyer that would require an out-of-pocket expenditure from Seller or its
Affiliates in order for Seller to perform the Services (e.g., payroll and
accounts payable, to the extent Buyer directs Seller and Seller agrees to pay
such amounts from accounts of Seller or its Affiliates) shall be advanced to
Seller by Buyer in a manner specified in a notice to Buyer from Seller from time
to time, it being understood that Seller shall have no obligation to make or
commit to make any such expenditure until such time as the applicable advance
has been received by Seller.

            11. CONFIDENTIALITY. Each party shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates and each of its and their officers, directors and employees to, hold
all information relating to the business of the other party disclosed to it by
reason of this Agreement (the "Confidential Information") confidential, and
shall not disclose or permit to be disclosed any such Confidential Information
to any third party unless legally required to disclose such information;
provided, however, that to the extent that a Person receiving Confidential
Information hereunder may receive the written advice of outside counsel that
disclosure of any Confidential Information is required in order that such Person
not commit a violation of law, such Person: (a) to the extent not inconsistent
with such Person's obligation to disclose, will give the other party hereto
prompt notice of such request so that such party may seek an appropriate
protective order: (b) may only disclose such information if it shall first have
used commercially reasonable efforts to, and, if practicable, shall have
afforded the other party the opportunity to, obtain an appropriate protective
order or other satisfactory assurance of confidential treatment for the
information required to be so disclosed; and (c) if such protective order or
other remedy is not obtained, or the other party waives such Person's compliance
with the provisions of this Section 11, shall only furnish that portion of the
Confidential Information which is legally required to be so disclosed. As used
herein, "Confidential Information" does not include any information that: (i) is
or becomes generally available to the public or the retail industry other than
as a result of a

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

disclosure by the party receiving the Confidential Information in violation of
this Agreement; (ii) was available to the receiving party on a non-confidential
basis prior to its disclosure by the disclosing party; (iii) becomes available
to the receiving party from a Person other than the disclosing party or its
Affiliates who is not, to the receiving party's knowledge, subject to any
legally binding obligation to keep such information confidential; or (iv) such
party demonstrates is or was independently developed by or on behalf of such
party without the direct or indirect use of any of the other party's
Confidential Information. In the event Buyer terminates this Agreement upon the
occurrence of a Change in Control pursuant to Section 7(d), Seller shall, at the
request of Buyer, promptly redeliver to Buyer all copies of documents containing
Confidential Information of Buyer and will promptly destroy all memoranda,
notes, writings and other material (in any format, including, without
limitation, electronic) prepared by Seller or any of its officers, directors,
employees or advisors based upon, in whole or in part, any Confidential
Information of Buyer. In addition, Seller will certify to Buyer its compliance
with this Section 11.

            12. THIRD PARTY NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS. To the extent that any
third party proprietor of information or Software to be disclosed or made
available to Buyer in connection with performance of the Services hereunder
requires a specific form of non-disclosure agreement as a condition of its
consent to use of the same for the benefit of Buyer or to permit Buyer access to
such information or Software, Buyer shall execute (and shall cause Buyer's
employees to execute, if required) any such form in substantially the same form
executed by Seller (if required).

            13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; DISCLAIMER; INDEMNITY.

            (a) Neither party nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be
liable to the other party, its Affiliates or any third party for any special,
incidental, consequential (including loss of revenues or profits), exemplary or
punitive damages arising from any claim relating to this Agreement or any of the
Services to be provided hereunder or the performance of or failure to perform
such party's obligations under this Agreement, whether such claim is based on
warranty, contract, tort (including negligence or strict liability) or
otherwise, all of which are hereby excluded by agreement of the parties
regardless of whether or not any party to this Agreement has been advised of the
possibility of such damages. In addition, neither party nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall be liable to the other party, its Affiliates or any
third party for any direct damages arising from any claim relating to this
Agreement or any of the Services to be provided hereunder or the performance of
or failure to perform such party's obligations under this Agreement, except to
the extent that such direct damages are caused by the fraud, negligence or
willful misconduct of such party or its respective Affiliates. EXCEPT AS
SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH HEREIN, SELLER SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF
ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller's cumulative
aggregate liability to Buyer and its Affiliates under this Agreement shall not
exceed the amount of fees paid by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this Agreement
during the six (6) months prior to the date of such failure; provided, that, if
the date of such failure occurs prior to the first 6-month anniversary of the
date of this Agreement, Seller's aggregate liability shall not exceed an amount
equal to the good faith estimate of the fees

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

to be paid during the first six (6) months of this Agreement unless such failure
arises from fraud or willful misconduct of Seller, which estimate shall be based
on the aggregate amount of fees received by Seller pursuant hereto at the time
of such failure. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
limitations set forth in this Section 13(a) shall not apply with respect to any
breach of Section 11.

            (b) Buyer shall indemnify Seller and each of its Affiliates against
all Losses attributable to any third party claims arising from or relating to
the provision of Services under this Agreement to the extent that such Losses
arise from the fraud, negligence or willful misconduct of Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective employees, officers or directors.

            (c) Seller shall indemnify Buyer and each of its Affiliates against
all Losses attributable to any third party claims arising from or relating to
the provision of Services under this Agreement to the extent that such Losses
arise from the fraud, negligence or willful misconduct of Seller, any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective employees, officers or directors.

            (d) All claims for indemnification pursuant to this Section 13 shall
be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sections 10.3 and 10.5 of
the Purchase Agreement.

            14. RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES. Except as specifically provided herein,
neither party shall: (a) act or represent or hold itself out as having authority
to act as an agent or partner of the other party; or (b) in any way bind or
commit the other party to any obligations or agreement. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture,
agency, trust, fiduciary relationship or other association of any kind, each
party being individually responsible only for its obligations as set forth in
this Agreement. The parties' respective rights and obligations hereunder shall
be limited to the contractual rights and obligations expressly set forth herein
on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

            15. FORCE MAJEURE. If Seller, any of its Affiliates or any
Subcontractor is prevented from or delayed in complying, either totally or in
part, with any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement by reason of fire,
flood, storm, strike, walkout, lockout or other labor trouble or shortage,
delays by unaffiliated suppliers or carriers, shortages of fuel, power, raw
materials or components, any law, order, proclamation, regulation, ordinance,
demand, seizure or requirement of any governmental authority, riot, civil
commotion, war, rebellion, acts of terrorism, nuclear accident or other causes
beyond the reasonable control of any such Person or other acts of God, or acts,
omissions or delays in acting by any governmental or military authority or
Buyer, then upon notice to Buyer, the affected provisions and/or other
requirements of this Agreement shall be suspended during the period of such
disability and Seller shall have no liability to Buyer, it Affiliates or any
other Person in connection therewith. Seller and Buyer shall make commercially
reasonable efforts to remove such disability within thirty (30) days after
giving notice of such disability; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 15 will be construed to require the settlement of any strike, walkout,
lockout or other labor dispute on terms which, in the reasonable judgment of
Seller, are contrary to its interest. It is understood that the settlement of a
strike, walkout, lockout or other labor dispute will be entirely within the
discretion of Seller. If Seller is unable to provide any of the Services due to
such a disability,

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

each party shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperatively seek
a solution that is mutually satisfactory. In addition, upon becoming aware of a
disability causing a delay in performance or preventing performance of any
obligations of Seller under this Agreement, Buyer shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to engage subcontractors to perform such obligations for the
duration of the period during which such disability delays or prevents the
performance of such obligation by Seller.

other party hereto.

            17. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The rights of either party under this
Agreement shall not be assignable by such party hereto (except by operation of
law in connection with a merger involving, or sale of substantially all of the
assets of, such party) without the prior written consent of the other party.
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any
Person other than the parties and successors and assigns permitted by this
Section 17 any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

            18. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENTS. This Agreement and the annexes
referred to herein and the documents delivered pursuant hereto contain the
entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter
contained herein or therein, and supersede all other prior representations,
warranties, agreements, understandings or letters of intent between or among any
of the parties hereto (it being understood, however, that the Purchase Agreement
and agreements contemplated thereby set forth certain additional understandings
between Seller and Buyer regarding their relationship after the Closing Date).
This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except by a
written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each of the parties
hereto.

            19. PARTIAL INVALIDITY. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating
the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions
or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be
unreasonable.

            20. WAIVERS. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived,
or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party,
it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The
failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any
way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of
any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any
breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach.

            21. EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument,
but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall

parties hereto and delivered to Seller and Buyer.

in accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflicts of law
provisions) of the State of New York.

IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

            24. INTERPRETATION. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not

Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement: (a) the words "include," "includes"

document means such agreement, instrument or other document as amended,
supplemented and modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the
provisions thereof and by this Agreement. Headings of Sections are inserted for
convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed a part of or to affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. This Agreement shall be construed

interpretation against the party drafting an instrument or causing any
instrument to be drafted.

integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if it was set forth
verbatim herein.

                           SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

            This SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of
[__________][-], 2006 (the "Effective Date"), is made between Saks Incorporated,
a Tennessee corporation (the "Licensor"), and [_____________], a [___________]
corporation (the "Licensee").

                                    RECITALS

            WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as
of [__________][-], 2006, by and between Licensor and Licensee (the "Purchase
Agreement"), Licensor has agreed to sell, or cause to be sold, to Licensee the
Shares, and Licensee has agreed to purchase the Shares as provided therein; and

            WHEREAS, under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Licensor agreed
to grant to Licensee and its respective Affiliates a non-exclusive, perpetual
license to use certain of the proprietary software of Licensor used in the
Business prior to the Effective Time.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, including the
consideration set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are acknowledged, the Licensor and Licensee agree as follows:

            1. LICENSE.

            (a) Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, Licensor grants
to Licensee and its Affiliates, and Licensee hereby accepts, a royalty-free,
non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as expressly provided herein),
irrevocable (except by termination of this Agreement as expressly provided
herein), fully paid-up and worldwide right and license (without any right to
sublicense) to: (i) load, reproduce and use the proprietary software (in object
and source code forms) identified on Exhibit A hereto as such software exists on
the Effective Time, as such software is modified, upgraded, improved or enhanced
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, dated as of [__________][-],
2006, by and between Licensor and Licensee, through the date of the termination
of the information technology services in the Transition Services Agreement (the
"Software") on an unlimited number of servers, mainframe, and mid-range
computers or client workstations within the organization of Licensee and its
Affiliates; (ii) modify, enhance, upgrade, create derivative works based upon
and otherwise maintain and support the Software; and (iii) reproduce the
Software for archival or back-up purposes only. All of the foregoing activities
shall be conducted solely with respect to the Business in connection with the
internal business operations of Licensee and its Affiliates and not for the
purpose of providing services to a third party.

<PAGE>

            (b) As applicable from time to time upon the reasonable request of
Licensee, Licensor will provide to Licensee copies of the Software in object
code and source code form, in the same form and medium as such Software was used
or maintained by Licensor prior to the Effective Time, including all changes to
the Software if modified, upgraded, improved or enhanced pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement prior to the date of termination of the
information technology services in the Transition Services Agreement; provided,
that, prior to any such delivery, all amounts due and owing to Licensor under
the Transition Services Agreement shall have been paid in full by Licensee.

            2. CONSIDERATION. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement,
Licensor agrees to grant the licenses contained in this Agreement without
additional compensation from Licensee.

            3. OWNERSHIP RIGHTS.

            (a) Except as provided in Section 3(b), all intellectual or other
property rights in or related to the Software are and will remain the exclusive
property of Licensor, whether or not specifically recognized or perfected under
applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee will not take any action
that jeopardizes Licensor's proprietary rights or acquire any right in the
Software, except the limited rights and licenses specified in Section 1.

            (b) All rights in new applications, improvements, new software,
data, derivative works or any other addition, alteration or improvement to the
Software or other materials developed or created by or for either party shall
belong to the party that develops or creates the same.

            (c) Each party will obtain, at the other party's request, the
execution of any instrument that the other party may request to give full effect
to their respective rights under this Section 3.

            4. CONFIDENTIALITY.

            (a) Licensee acknowledges that the Software incorporates
confidential and proprietary information. Licensee shall take all necessary
precautions to safeguard the confidentiality of the Software, including (i)
those taken by Licensee to protect its own confidential information; and (ii)
those Licensor may reasonably require from time to time; provided, however, that
under no circumstances shall the Licensee use less care than what is used to
protect its own confidential and proprietary information. Licensee will not
allow the removal or defacement of any confidentiality or proprietary notice
placed on the Software, and will reproduce such notices on each copy of the
Software that it makes. The placement of copyright notices on these items will
not constitute publication or otherwise impair their confidential nature.

                                       2
<PAGE>

            (b) Licensee will not disclose, in whole or in part, any portion of
the Software to any individual, entity or other person; provided nothing herein
shall prevent Licensee from disclosing the Software to those of its employees or
consultants who: (i) require access for any authorized use of the Software; and
(ii) agree to comply with the use and non-disclosure restrictions applicable to
the Software under this Agreement. Licensee acknowledges that any unauthorized
use or disclosure of the Software may cause irreparable damage to Licensor. If
Licensee becomes aware of an unauthorized use or disclosure, Licensee shall
immediately notify Licensor. Licensee shall take, at its expense, all reasonable
steps which may be available to recover the Software, and to prevent its
subsequent unauthorized use or dissemination. Licensee shall be responsible for
any breach of this Agreement by its employees or consultants.

            (c) A confidentiality obligation will not exist for Licensee with
respect to any portion of the Software that: (i) Licensee lawfully obtained from
a third party without a confidentiality obligation; (ii) became available to the
public other than as a result of any act or omission by Licensee or any of its
employees or consultants; or (iii) is independently developed by Licensee or its
Affiliates after the Effective Time by persons not having access or any

            (d) If Licensee is ordered to disclose any confidential or
proprietary information incorporated in the Software of Licensor, whether in a
legal or regulatory proceeding, Licensee shall provide Licensor with prompt
notice of such order and any opportunity to prevent such disclosure. In the
event of any disclosure under this provision, Licensee shall disclose only that
portion of the confidential or proprietary information that it is ordered to
disclose pursuant to such legal or regulatory proceeding. Any such disclosure
shall not be a breach of this Agreement.

            5. DISCLAIMER OF ALL WARRANTIES ON SOFTWARE.

NON-INFRINGEMENT) ARE HEREBY OVERRIDDEN, EXCLUDED AND DISCLAIMED.

notify Licensor in writing. Licensor shall at all times have the right, but not
the obligation, to take whatever steps it deems necessary or desirable to

litigation that ensues with respect to such infringement when and as reasonably
requested by Licensor, and at Licensor's expense, including Licensee's
reasonable costs.

AGREEMENT REPRESENT THE EXPRESS AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE
ALLOCATION OF RISKS AMONG THE PARTIES INCLUDING: (i) THE FACT THAT LICENSOR
DEVELOPED THE SOFTWARE FOR ITS OWN INTERNAL USE; (ii) THE SOFTWARE IS NOT

hereto.

shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating
the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions
or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be

sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party,
it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The
failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this

subsequent breach.

or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument,
but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall

in accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflicts of law
provisions) of the State of New York.

            18. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY

HEREBY.

                              Dated as of [ ], 2006

      This Club Libby Lu Licensed Departments Agreement (this "AGREEMENT") is
between Parisian Stores, Inc., an Alabama corporation ("LICENSOR"), and Club

                              TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      Licensor and Licensee agree as follows:

      1. LOCATIONS. Licensee operates a department (each a "DEPARTMENT" and
together the "DEPARTMENTS") for the sale of specialty merchandise targeting
pre-teen girls and directly related items and related services (the "SPECIALTY
MERCHANDISE") at each of Licensor's department stores listed on Schedule A (each
listed department store a "LOCATION" and together the "LOCATIONS"). Licensor
will provide Licensee with the floor space currently being utilized by Licensee
at each of the Locations in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to and in
accordance with Section 17(g), Licensor may close any Location. Licensee will
operate all Departments for the sale of the Specialty Merchandise at each
Location in accordance with this Agreement.

      2. TERM. The term of this Agreement will begin at the date hereof and,

indefinite period subject to termination by either party by providing the other
party with not less than 90 days prior written notice of termination.

      3. LICENSE FEE.

            (a) AMOUNT. Licensee will pay to Licensor a license fee equal to 10%

            (b) NET SALES. "NET SALES" means the total amount, in dollars, of
all sales of every kind made by or for Licensee at or from the Departments,
after deducting the following: (i) refunds and credits to purchasers for
returned goods; (ii) adjustments because of price differences on the exchange of
goods; (iii) allowances for unsatisfactory services and merchandise where such
allowances are not replaced or paid by the merchandise manufacturer or supplier;

procedures established by Licensor from time to time. Receipts will be deemed
received as follows: (i) cash receipts will be deemed received on the date
actually received by Licensor; (ii) properly authorized credit card sales will

and all payments and collections on account

<PAGE>

solely to it; and (iii) properly authorized check receipts will be deemed
received for the full price on the date registered in the POS terminal and all
collections on account of check receipts will become the property of Licensor
and payable solely to it.

            (d) SETTLEMENT. All Receipts will be held by Licensor until an
accounting is made as provided in this Agreement. On or before the twentieth
(20th) day following the end of each Monthly Period during the term of this
Agreement, Licensor will deliver to Licensee a written statement of Receipts
held by Licensor for the Monthly Period most recently ended and an accounting

Fee; (ii) Licensor's actual costs for third-party bank credit card charges;

amount of unapproved credit charges, chargebacks by credit card issuers, and
checks which were not properly authorized and returned without payment for any
reason, including insufficient funds or fraud; (v) any amount to be paid by
Licensor to any taxing authorities with respect to taxes (other than income
taxes or capital gains taxes) on the License Fee payable to Licensor under this
Agreement; and (vi) any Adjustments pursuant to Section 3(g). Items (ii) through
(v) above are referred to herein collectively as the "LICENSOR DEDUCTIONS."

            (e) INSPECTION OF RECORDS. Licensee will keep at its address
identified in this Agreement for communications all books, invoices, records,
and accounts relating to its business conducted under the terms of this
Agreement, which will show among other things, all of Licensee's sales (for
goods and services) in or from the Departments. Licensor will have the right to
inspect such records at reasonable times during regular business hours. Licensor
will keep at its address identified in this Agreement for communications all
books, invoices, records, and accounts relating to the information contained in

books, invoices, records, and accounts relating to the information contained in
any Settlement Statement for at least two years from the end of the Weekly
Period to which they relate.

            (f) MONTHLY PERIOD. "MONTHLY PERIOD" means a fiscal period
consisting of approximately thirty (30) consecutive calendar days, beginning and
ending pursuant to Licensor's published fiscal calendar.

            (g) ADJUSTMENTS. Licensor may adjust and settle disputes between
Licensee and its customers (an "ADJUSTMENT") to the extent such Adjustment is
equal to or less than the value of the goods or services that are the subject of
such dispute. In no event shall Licensor approve an Adjustment that exceeds the
value of the goods or services that are the subject of such dispute without the

      4. ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF LICENSEE.

            (a) PERMITTED USE. The Departments will be used and occupied for the

            (b) COVENANT OF CONTINUOUS OPERATION. Licensee will continuously and
uninterruptedly occupy and use the Departments for the purpose of selling the
Specialty Merchandise at all hours that the Locations are open. Licensee will

this Agreement.

            (c) EMPLOYEES; INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. Licensee will employ
competent and sufficient management and selling employees who will be
responsible for the efficient operation of the Departments, including without
limitation competent managerial personnel at each Location. All Persons employed
by Licensee in the operation of the Departments will be the employees of
Licensee only. Licensee alone will determine the terms and conditions of such
employment. Licensee's employees will be hired, paid, supervised, directed,
controlled and fired solely by Licensee. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 4, Licensee will remove from the Departments
any Person who knowingly violates any of Licensor's procedures, policies, rules,
or regulations.

            (d) OPERATING NAME. All sales, services, and other contact with

will pay for such purchases on or before the date they are due. The parties
acknowledge and agree that Licensee may use Licensee's trademark "Club Libby Lu"
in sign toppers and other advertising. Licensor hereby consents and agrees that
Licensee is permitted, for identification and location purposes, to reference
the name under which the Location is operated (i.e., "Parisian" or any other
name under which the Location is operated from time to time).

            (e) CLOSE-OUT SALES. Licensee will not conduct or permit at the
Departments any going-out-of-business, bankruptcy, fire, auction, or similar
sale.

            (f) ADVERTISING. If Licensee uses Licensor's name or the name under
which the Location is being operated in an advertisement for any reason other
than to indicate the location of Licensee's Department, then such advertisement
shall be subject to the prior written approval of Licensor (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) as to, without limitation, drawings,
photographs, cuts, art work, typography and signage. Licensee will cause all of
such advertising to comply with applicable law. All such advertising shall be at
Licensee's sole cost

                                       3
<PAGE>

and expense. Licensee shall submit any such advertising to Licensor for approval
not less than one (1) week prior to the time such advertising is to be
published.

            Licensor may advertise Licensee's goods and services and use
Licensee's name or the name under which the Department is being operated in the
trading areas in which the Locations are located in furtherance of the sale of
the Specialty Merchandise, subject in each case to the prior written approval of
Licensee (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of all advertising
materials, including, without limitation, drawings, photographs, cuts, art work,
typography and signage. Licensor will cause all such advertising to comply with
applicable law. All such advertising shall be at Licensor's sole cost and
expense. Licensor shall submit all such advertising to Licensee for approval not
less than one (1) week prior to the time such advertising is to be published.

            (g) PRICING. In the event a Location is in a mall or other shopping
center which contains another Club Libby Lu store, Licensee agrees to offer the
same or similar products or services at such Location and the other location in
the same mall or shopping center at the same prices.

      5. TERMINATION AND SURRENDER OF SPACE. All attachments and fixtures in or
about the Departments, except only free-standing trade fixtures, are Licensor's
property and will remain upon the Locations at the termination of this
Agreement. Licensee will remove all of its free-standing trade fixtures and
other personal property from the Department upon termination of this Agreement,
leave each Department and the surrounding area in a clean and orderly condition,
and repair any damage caused by the removal of such trade fixtures and personal
property. In addition, if requested by Licensor, Licensee will remove any
fixtures installed in the Department in connection with Licensee's operations
and repair any damage to the Department caused by such removal.

      6. SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT TO BE PROVIDED BY LICENSOR. Licensor at its
expense will furnish to the Departments the following: (a) electricity, heat,
air conditioning, and ventilation; (b) carpeting (as to each Department, only if
the remainder of the selling floor in the Location is carpeted); (c)
point-of-sale terminals; (d) permanent fixtures; (e) Licensor's standard credit
card, check, and cash handling services; and (f) if requested by Licensee,

charges including toll calls and additional phone installation, including toll

Licensee will furnish and install, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, all fixtures, furniture and equipment necessary to operate each

      9. SALES TAXES. Licensee will be responsible for and will pay all license
and franchise fees and taxes which may be imposed on the business at the
Departments. For the convenience of Licensee, Licensor will remit all sales
taxes imposed on the Licensee's sales at the Departments reported to Licensor.
If any examination of tax returns discloses tax deficiencies attributable to
Licensee, such amount will be charged to Licensee's account and may be deducted
from the proceeds due Licensee pursuant to the next Settlement Statement.

      10. RELOCATION OR RECONFIGURATION. Licensor may change any floor space
occupied by Licensee in a Location to another floor space in the Location or
redecorate or rearrange any existing floor space occupied by Licensee, in each
case only (i) upon 30 days' prior written notice to Licensee, (ii) if the new or
reconfigured floor space is of approximately the same area, size, and
desirability as the original floor space and (iii) with the prior written
consent of Licensee, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If
any floor space in a Location is relocated, redecorated, or rearranged pursuant
to this Section 10, this Agreement and all of its terms, covenants and
conditions will remain in full force and effect and be deemed applicable to such
new floor space and such new floor space will thereafter be deemed to be
included as part of the Locations. The cost of all relocations, redecorating,
and rearrangements will be borne by Licensor, but Licensee will be required to
pay the cost of any additional or replacement trade fixtures Licensee requests
that Licensor install in the relocated, redecorated, or rearranged floor space.

      11. ALTERATIONS. Licensee will not make any alteration in or addition to
the Departments or do any nailing, boring, or screwing into the ceilings, walls,
or doors without Licensor's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). Unless otherwise agreed by Licensor and Licensee in
writing, all such work will be performed either by or under the direction of
Licensor, but at Licensee's expense. Licensee will, at Licensee's sole cost and
expense, either (a) discharge of record any contractor's lien filed against the
Locations for work furnished to Licensee within 10 days after filing or (b) post
a surety bond or other security with Licensor in a form and amount reasonably
satisfactory to Licensor. Upon completion of any alteration or addition,
Licensee will furnish Licensor with contractors' affidavits and full and final
waivers of liens for all labor and materials expended and used in connection
with the alterations and additions. All alterations and additions will comply
with all insurance requirements and all governmental ordinances and regulations.
All alterations and additions will be constructed in a competent manner, and new
materials of good grade will be used.

      12. DAMAGE BY FIRE OR OTHER CASUALTY. If a Department, in the reasonable
judgment of Licensor, is made wholly or partially untenantable by fire or other
casualty, Licensor will elect in its sole discretion, by written notice to
Licensee within 30 days after the date of such fire or casualty, to (a)
terminate this Agreement with respect to the Department as of the date of the
fire or casualty, or (b) to proceed with all due diligence to repair, restore or
rehabilitate the Department to a reasonably tenantable condition within a
reasonable time. If this Agreement is

                                       5
<PAGE>

terminated as a result of such fire or other casualty, Licensee will pay the
License Fee up to the date of the fire or other casualty. A casualty loss at one
Department will not affect Licensee's or Licensor's obligations pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to the other Departments.

      13. CONDEMNATION. If all of a Location is lawfully taken or condemned,
then the term of this Agreement with respect to the Location will end on the
date of the taking of possession by the condemning authority. No money or other
consideration will be payable by Licensor to Licensee upon the termination, and
Licensee will have no right to share in the condemnation award or in any
judgment for damages resulting from the condemnation.

      If only a part of the Location is taken or condemned, Licensor will have
the right to terminate this Agreement only with respect to the affected Location
by giving Licensee notice of termination. Condemnation as to one Location will
have no effect on the obligations of Licensor and Licensee pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to the other Locations.

      14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION.

            (a) LIMITATION. Neither party nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall be liable to the other party, its Affiliates or any third party for any
special, incidental, consequential (including loss of revenues or profits),
exemplary or punitive damages arising from any claim relating to this Agreement
or the performance of or failure to perform such party's obligations under this
Agreement, whether such claim is based on contract, tort (including negligence
or strict liability) or otherwise, all of which are hereby excluded by agreement
of the parties regardless of whether or not any party to this Agreement has been
advised of the possibility of such damages. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, the limitations set forth in this Section 14 shall not
apply with respect to the costs specified in Section 10 (unless Licensor makes
replacement space available so that Licensee is not required to be closed during
normal business hours) or any breach of Section 26.

            (b) BY LICENSEE. Licensee agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold
harmless Licensor and its subsidiaries and Affiliates and their respective
agents, contractors, attorneys, employees, directors, sublessees,
concessionaires, licensees (other than Licensee), business invitees, successors,
and assigns (together, the "LICENSOR INDEMNITEES") against and from any and all
out-of-pocket losses, costs, settlement payments, awards, judgments, fines,
penalties, damages, expenses, deficiencies or other charges (collectively,
"LOSSES") (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' and expert
witnesses' fees incurred by the Licensor Indemnitee with respect to any such
damage, cost, or expense) arising from or in connection with the operation of
the Departments by Licensee, including without limitation for any (i) property
loss and personal injury, (ii) breach or default on the part of Licensee in the
performance of any agreement on the part of Licensee to be performed pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, (iii) violation of law by Licensee, or (iv) other
action of, or failure to act by, Licensee, its agents, contractors, employees,
sublessees, concessionaires, licensees or business invitees (excluding
customers) unless such Losses resulted from the negligence or willful misconduct
of any Licensor Indemnitee.

            (c) BY LICENSOR. Licensor agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold
harmless Licensee and its subsidiaries and Affiliates and their respective
agents, contractors, attorneys,

                                       6
<PAGE>

employees, directors, business invitees, permitted successors, and permitted
assigns (together, the "LICENSEE INDEMNITEES") against and from any and all
Losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' and expert
witnesses' fees incurred by the Licensee Indemnitee with respect to any such
damage, cost, or expense) arising from or in connection with the operation of
Licensor's business at the Locations, including without limitation for any (i)
property loss and personal injury, (ii) breach or default on the part of
Licensor in the performance of any agreement on the part of Licensor to be
performed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (iii) violation of law by
Licensor, or (iv) other action of, or failure to act by, Licensor, its agents,
contractors, employees, sublessees, concessionaires, licensees or business
invitees (excluding customers) unless such Losses resulted from the negligence
or willful misconduct of any Licensee Indemnitee.

            (d) PROCEDURE. All claims for indemnification pursuant to this
Section 14 shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in
paragraphs (e) and (f) of this Section 14. Neither party shall be entitled to
recover on any claim hereunder unless suit is instituted within one year after
such party becomes aware of the facts giving rise to such claim.

            (e) NOTICE OF CLAIMS. Any Licensor Indemnitee or Licensee Indemnitee
seeking indemnification hereunder (the "INDEMNIFIED Party") shall give promptly
to the party obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the
"INDEMNITOR") a notice (a "CLAIM NOTICE") describing in reasonable detail the
facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification hereunder and shall include
in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method of computation of
the amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision of this Agreement
upon which such claim is based; provided, however, that a Claim Notice in
respect of any action at law or suit in equity by or against a third Person as
to which indemnification will be sought shall be given promptly after the action
or suit is commenced.

            (f) THIRD PERSON CLAIMS.

                  (i) Any party seeking indemnification provided for under this
Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by
any third Person against the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnitor in
writing, and in reasonable detail, of the third Person claim within five
business days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the
third Person claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnitor, within 10 business days after the Indemnified Party's receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the Indemnified Party relating to the third Person claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, should a party be physically served with a complaint with regard to a
third Person claim, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnitor with a
copy of the complaint within five business days after receipt thereof and shall
deliver to the Indemnitor within seven business days after the receipt of such
complaint copies of notices and documents (including court papers) received by
the Indemnified Party relating to the third Person claim. The failure to give
notice as provided in this paragraph (f)(i) of this Section 14 shall not relieve
the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have
been prejudiced by such failure.

                  (ii) In the event any legal proceeding shall be threatened or
instituted or any claim or demand shall be asserted by any Person in respect of
which payment may be

                                       7
<PAGE>

sought by one party hereto from the other party under the provisions of this
Section 14, the Indemnified Party shall promptly cause written notice of the
assertion of any such claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this
indemnity to be forwarded to the Indemnitor. Any notice of a claim shall contain
a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document
or instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim
is based, the facts giving rise to an alleged basis for the claim and the amount
(including the method of computation of the amount) of the liability asserted
against the Indemnitor by reason of the claim. In the event of the initiation of
any legal proceeding against the Indemnified Party by a third Person, the
Indemnitor shall have the sole and absolute right after the receipt of notice,
at its option and at its own expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice
and to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
proceeding, claim, or demand which relates to any loss, liability or damage
indemnified against hereunder; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may
participate in any such proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its
expense. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in
connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such legal
proceeding, claim or demand. To the extent the Indemnitor elects not to defend
such proceeding, claim or demand, and the Indemnified Party defends against or
otherwise deals with any such proceeding, claim or demand, the Indemnified Party
may retain counsel, at the expense of the Indemnitor, and control the defense of
such proceeding. Neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnified Party may settle any
such proceeding which settlement obligates the other party to pay money, to
perform obligations or to admit liability without the consent of the other
party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. After any final
judgment or award shall have been rendered by a court, arbitration board or
administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and the time in which to appeal
therefrom has expired, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall arrive at a mutually binding
agreement with respect to each separate matter alleged to be indemnified by the
Indemnitor hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the Indemnitor
notice of any sums due and owing by it with respect to such matter and the
Indemnitor shall pay all of the sums so owing to the Indemnified Party by wire
transfer, certified or bank cashier's check within 30 days after the date of
such notice.

      15. ASSIGNMENT. Licensee will not, without the prior written consent of
Licensor (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) assign this
Agreement or any interest under this Agreement; provided, that, the written
consent of Licensor shall not be required in connection with (x) an assignment
to an Affiliate or (y) an assignment relating to a sale of all or substantially
all of the Club Libby Lu assets (by merger, consolidation, purchase or
otherwise). This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns.

      16. CERTAIN RIGHTS RESERVED TO LICENSOR. Licensor reserves the right to
take any and all measures, including inspections, repairs, alterations,
decorations, additions, and improvements to the Locations, as may be reasonably
necessary (a) in the operation of, or (b) for the safety, protection, or
preservation of, the Locations or any building of which the Locations are a
part. Licensor may enter the Locations and Departments and may exercise any or
all of the foregoing rights hereby reserved without (w) being deemed guilty of
an eviction or disturbance to Licensee's use or possession, (x) being liable in
any manner to Licensee, (y) abatement of the License Fee, or (z) affecting any
of Licensee's obligations under this Agreement.

                                       8
<PAGE>

      17. REMEDIES. All rights and remedies in this Agreement will be cumulative
and do not exclude any other right or remedy allowed by law.

            (a) If any involuntary action or proceeding under any section of any
bankruptcy or debtor relief act in any court or tribunal will adjudge or declare
Licensee insolvent or unable to pay Licensee's debts, or if any voluntary
petition or similar proceeding under any section of any bankruptcy or debtor
relief act will be filed by Licensee in any court or tribunal to declare
Licensee insolvent or unable to pay Licensee's debts, then any such event will
be deemed a repudiation by Licensee of its obligations under this Agreement and
this Agreement will be automatically terminated without releasing Licensee. Upon
such termination, Licensor will have the immediate right to enter the
Departments and to remove all Persons and property. Upon such termination, this
Agreement will not be treated as an asset of Licensee's estate and neither
Licensee nor anyone claiming by, through, or under Licensee by virtue of any law
or any order of any court will be entitled to the possession of or to remain in
possession of the Departments. Upon such termination of this Agreement, and
notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Licensor will be
entitled to recover damages in the maximum amount provided by law.

            (b) If any of the following occur:

                  (i) if Licensee defaults in the payment of any required
amount(s), and Licensee does not cure the default within 15 days after written
demand for payment of such amount(s);

                  (ii) if Licensee defaults under Sections 4(a) or 4(b) (it is
the intention of the parties that Licensee's performance of these Sections is of
the essence of this Agreement and that any breach by Licensee will result in
immediate default without Licensee having any right to cure); or

                  (iii) if Licensee defaults in the prompt and full performance
of any other provision of this Agreement, and Licensee does not cure the default
within 30 days after receipt by Licensee of written notice, or if not able to be
cured within said 30-day period, significant steps to cure have been taken by
Licensee within the period; provided; however, that if the default involves a
hazardous condition, it will be cured immediately if reasonably possible;

then Licensor may elect with notice, but without further demand upon Licensee to
cure, (x) to terminate this Agreement and Licensee's right to possession of the
Departments, or (y) to convert the remaining term of this Agreement to a
month-to-month term that may be terminated by either party upon not less than 30
days' prior written notice to the other.

            (c) If any involuntary action or proceeding under any section of any
bankruptcy or debtor relief act in any court or tribunal will adjudge or declare
Licensor insolvent or unable to pay Licensor's debts, or if any voluntary
petition or similar proceeding under any section of any bankruptcy or debtor
relief act will be filed by Licensor in any court or tribunal to declare
Licensor insolvent or unable to pay Licensor's debts, then any such event will
be deemed a repudiation by Licensor of its obligations under this Agreement and
this Agreement

                                       9
<PAGE>

will be automatically terminated without releasing Licensor. Upon such
termination, this Agreement will not be treated as an asset of Licensor's estate
and neither Licensor nor anyone claiming by, through, or under Licensor by
virtue of any law or any order of any court will be entitled to the possession
of the Departments. Upon such termination of this Agreement, and notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement, Licensee will be entitled to recover
damages in the maximum amount provided by law.

            (d) If any of the following occur:

                  (i) if Licensor defaults in the payment of any required sum,
and Licensor does not cure the default within 15 days after written demand for
payment of such amounts;

                  (ii) if Licensor defaults under Sections 3(d) or 6 (it is the
intention of the parties that Licensor's performance of these Sections is of the
essence of this Agreement and that any breach by Licensor will result in the
immediate default without Licensor having any right to cure); or

                  (ii) if Licensor defaults in the prompt and full performance
of any other provision of this Agreement, and Licensor does not cure the default
within 30 days after receipt by Licensor of written notice, or if not able to be
cured within said 30-day period significant steps to cure have been taken by
Licensor within the period; provided, however, that if the default involves a
hazardous condition, it will be cured immediately if reasonably possible;

then Licensee may elect with notice, but without further demand upon Licensor to
cure, (x) to terminate this Agreement, or (y) to convert the remaining term of
this Agreement to a month-to-month term that may be terminated by either party
upon not less than 30 days' prior written notice to the other.

            (e) Upon any termination of this Agreement by Licensor, Licensee
will promptly surrender possession, vacate the Departments, and deliver
possession of the Departments to Licensor.

            (f) Upon any termination of this Agreement by Licensor, all property
that may be removed from the Departments by Licensor pursuant to the authority
of this Agreement or of law, to which Licensee is or may be entitled, may be
handled, removed, and stored by Licensor at the risk, cost, and expense of
Licensee, and Licensor will in no event be responsible for the value,
preservation, or safekeeping of the property. Licensee will pay to Licensor,
upon demand, all reasonable expenses incurred in the removal and all storage
charges against the property while it remains in Licensor's possession or under
Licensor's control.

            (g) If Licensor elects to close any Location in accordance with
Section 1, it will give Licensee not less than 90 days' prior written notice of
the closing. This Agreement will terminate as to the subject Department as of
the date of the closing. No money or other consideration will be payable by
Licensor to Licensee upon the termination, and this Agreement will continue in
full force and effect as to all remaining Departments from and after the
termination.

                                       10

      18. SUBORDINATION. This Agreement, at Licensor's option, will be
subordinate to any mortgage, now or hereafter placed upon the Locations and to
any and all advances made on the security of the mortgage and to all renewals,
modifications, consolidations, replacements, and extensions thereof.
Notwithstanding such subordination, Licensee's right to quiet possession of the
Departments pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will not be disturbed if
Licensee is not in default under this Agreement, unless this Agreement is
otherwise terminated pursuant to its terms. If any mortgagee elects to have this
Agreement prior to the lien of its mortgage and will give written notice thereof
to Licensee, this Agreement will be deemed prior to such mortgage, whether this
Agreement is dated prior to or subsequent to the date of the mortgage or the
date of its recording. Licensee agrees to execute any documents required to
effectuate an attornment or subordination or to make this Agreement prior to the
lien of any mortgage. Licensee's failure to execute such documents within 20
days after written demand will constitute a material default by Licensee under
this Agreement.

      19. ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE. Either party shall, at any time and from time to
time upon not less than thirty (30) days' prior written request from the other
party hereto, at its own expense, execute, acknowledge and deliver to the
requesting party, a certificate, in recordable form, stating (if such be the
case) that this Agreement is in full force and effect and that there are no
defenses or offsets thereto, or stating those claimed by Licensor or Licensee,
as applicable, and the then-current status of the License Fee payments.

      20. NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT. Neither Licensor nor Licensee shall, without
the approval of the other, make any press release or other public announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the
extent that any such party shall be so obligated by law, in which case the other
party shall be advised and the parties shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not preclude communications or
disclosures necessary to implement the provisions of this Agreement or to comply
with Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure obligations or the rules of
any United States or foreign stock exchange.

      21. NOTICES; CONSENTS.

            (a) All notices or other communications required or permitted

maintain the following insurance:

                  (i) Public liability insurance (including liability under any
applicable safe place statute) insuring Licensee against all claims on account
of personal injury or death and personal property damage for which Licensee may
become liable as a result of the use or occupancy of the Departments in at least
the following amounts: $1,000,000.00 for death or injuries to any one Person,
$1,000,000.00 for any one occurrence, and $50,000.00 for personal property
damage;

                  (ii) Workers compensation insurance as required by law;

                  (iii) Products liability insurance in an amount not less than
the amounts required in this Agreement for public liability insurance.

            (b) Upon request by Licensor, Licensee will deposit with Licensor
certificates evidencing the existence of such insurance. All such insurance will
be through insurers reasonably acceptable to Licensor and will name Licensor as
an additional insured.

            (c) Licensor agrees, from and after the date of this Agreement, to
maintain property insurance and general liability insurance policies that are
commercially reasonable and customary for the retail department store industry.

      23. POLICIES, REGULATIONS AND LAWS. Licensee will comply in all material
respects with all of Licensor's policies and procedures pertaining to customers
and employees generally. Each of Licensor and Licensee will comply with all
laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations, federal, state, county or municipal,
now or hereafter in force, applicable to the Locations or to their respective
operations, as the same may be changed, modified or amended from time to time.
Each of Licensor and Licensee will, at its own cost and expense, procure and
maintain each and

                                       12
<PAGE>

every permit, license, certificate or other authorization and any renewals,
extensions or continuances required in connection with the lawful and proper
operation of their respective businesses. Licensor retains the right to issue,
from time to time, reasonable written rules and regulations, and alterations and
modifications, and additions thereto, applicable to the Locations generally.
These rules and regulations will constitute and will be made a part of this
Agreement 30 days after they have been provided to Licensee by Licensor.

      24. REINSTATEMENT. No receipt of money by Licensor from Licensee after (a)
the termination of this Agreement, (b) the service of any notice, or (c) the
commencement of any suit or after final judgment for possession of the
Departments, will reinstate, continue or extend the term of this Agreement or
affect any such notice, demand or suit.

      25. LICENSOR'S RIGHT TO PERFORM LICENSEE'S DUTIES. If Licensee fails
timely to perform any of its material duties under this Agreement (excluding any
payment obligations), Licensor will have the right (but not the obligation),
after the expiration of any grace period expressly granted to Licensee in this
Agreement for the performance of such duty, to perform such duty on behalf and
at the expense of Licensee without further prior notice to Licensee. All
out-of-pocket sums expended or out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by
Licensor in performing such duty will be due and payable immediately upon demand
by Licensor.

      26. CONFIDENTIALITY.

            (a) CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. By transacting business in the
Departments, Licensee may have access to information contained in or upon
Licensor's proprietary credit cards (collectively the "LICENSOR CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION"). Licensor Confidential Information will not include information in
the public domain, information of Licensor known to the Licensee by lawful means
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and information lawfully
obtained from a third party by Licensee.

            (b) LIMITATION ON USE OF LICENSOR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Licensor
Confidential Information will be used by Licensee solely to process sales
transactions under this Agreement and for no other purpose. Licensee will not
(i) retain any Licensor Confidential Information after a sale transaction is
completed or (ii) sell, assign, rent, barter, exchange, or otherwise transfer in
any form or by any means any Licensor Confidential Information; provided,
however, that to the extent that Licensee may become legally compelled to
disclose any Licensor Confidential Information, it: (a) may only disclose such
information if it shall first have used commercially reasonable efforts to, and,
if practicable, shall have afforded Licensor the opportunity to, obtain an
appropriate protective order or other satisfactory assurance of confidential
treatment for the information required to be so disclosed; and (b) if such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or Licensor waives such
Licensee's compliance with the provisions of this Section 26, shall only furnish
that portion of the Licensor Confidential Information which is legally required
to be so disclosed. Licensee will be responsible, and will assume all liability,
for all disclosures and uses of Licensor Confidential Information by its
Affiliates, advisors, directors, officers, and employees that violate this
Section 26.

            (c) OWNERSHIP OF LICENSOR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Licensee
acknowledges and agrees that all Licensor Confidential Information, in whatever
form, is

                                       13
<PAGE>

exclusively the property of Licensor. Upon the request of, and as directed by,
Licensor, Licensee will either return to Licensor, or destroy, any Licensor
Confidential Information in Licensee's possession. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, any information obtained by Licensee directly
from a customer (i.e., not from information contained in or upon Licensor's
proprietary credit cards), in whatever form, is exclusively the property of
Licensee.

            (d) BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Each party shall, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates and each of its and their officers, directors and
employees to, hold all information relating to the business of the other party
disclosed to it by reason of this Agreement (the "Business Confidential
Information") confidential, and shall not disclose or permit to be disclosed any
such Business Confidential Information to any third party unless legally
required to disclose such information; provided, however, that to the extent
that a Person receiving Business Confidential Information hereunder may become
legally required to disclose any Business Confidential Information, such Person:
(a) may only disclose such information if it shall first have used commercially
reasonable efforts to, and, if practicable, shall have afforded the other party
the opportunity to, obtain an appropriate protective order or other satisfactory
assurance of confidential treatment for the information required to be so
disclosed; and (b) if such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or
the other party waives such Person's compliance with the provisions of this
Section 26, shall only furnish that portion of the Business Confidential
Information which is legally required to be so disclosed. As used herein,
"Business Confidential Information" does not include any information that: (i)
is or becomes generally available to the public or the retail industry other
than as a result of a disclosure by the party receiving the Business
Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement; (ii) was available to
the receiving party on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by the
disclosing party; (iii) becomes available to the receiving party from a Person
other than the disclosing party or its Affiliates who is not, to the receiving
party's knowledge, subject to any legally binding obligation to keep such
information confidential; (iv) such party demonstrates is or was independently
developed by or on behalf of such party without the direct or indirect use of
any of the other party's Business Confidential Information; or (v) Licensor
Confidential Information (which information is covered by paragraphs (b) and (c)
above).

            (e) REMEDIES. Each of the parties acknowledges that all Licensor
Confidential Information and Business Confidential Information is considered to
be proprietary and of competitive value, and constitutes in many instances trade
secrets. Because of the unique nature of the Licensor Confidential Information
and Business Confidential Information, (a) any breach of this Agreement by
either party or any of its respective Affiliates would cause the other party
irreparable harm and money damages and (b) other remedies available at law in
the event of a breach would not be adequate to compensate the other party for
any such breach. Accordingly, upon a breach of this Section 26, each other party
will be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security,
to equitable relief, including without limitation injunctive relief and specific
performance, as a remedy for any such breach, in addition to, and not in lieu
of, all other remedies available at law or in equity.

      27. TITLE. Licensor's title to the Locations is and always will be
paramount to the title of Licensee, and nothing in this Agreement will empower
Licensee to do any act which will or may encumber Licensor's title.

be inconsistent with any provision of the Prime Lease, the provisions of this

            (b) Nothing contained in this Sublease shall be construed so as to
create privity of estate or of contract between Subtenant and Prime Landlord.

            (c) Sublandlord covenants that it will perform all of Sublandlord's
duties and obligations as tenant under the Prime Lease and agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless Subtenant against and from all Losses, (including, but not

obligations hereunder.

            (g) Sublandlord shall not do or cause to be done or suffer or permit
to be done any default or breach under the Prime Lease which causes the Prime
Lease or the rights of Sublandlord as tenant thereunder to be terminated.
Subtenant shall not do or cause to be done or suffer or permit to be done any
act or thing which would or might constitute a default under the Prime Lease or
cause the Prime Lease or the rights or benefits of Sublandlord as tenant

<PAGE>

      amount of not less than Five Million and No/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00)

                  (ii) Insurance covering the Building to the extent of its full
      replacement cost under broad form standard fire and extended coverage
      insurance, including, without limitation, vandalism and malicious mischief

            (b) Subject to reasonable deductibles, Subtenant shall procure and

            (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Sublease to the
contrary, whenever (i) any Losses resulting from fire, explosion or any other
casualty or occurrence is incurred by either of the parties to this Sublease, or
anyone claiming by, through, or under such party in connection with the
Subleased Premises, Building or Real Property, and (ii) such party is then
covered in whole or in part by insurance with respect to such Losses, or is
required under this Sublease to be so insured, then the party so insured (or so
required) hereby waives any claims against and releases the other party from any
liability the other party may have on account of such Losses (including, without
limitation, any indemnity obligation set forth in this Sublease) to the extent
of any amount recovered by reason of such insurance (or which could have been
recovered had such insurance been carried as so required); provided that such
waiver of claims or release of liability shall not be operative in any case
where the effect thereof is to invalidate such insurance coverage or increase
the cost thereof (except that in the case of increased cost, the other party
shall have the right, within thirty (30) days following written notice, to pay
such increased cost, thereby keeping such release or waiver in full force and
effect). Sublandlord and Subtenant each agree to give written notice of the
waiver of claims and subrogation rights contained in this Section (d) to each
insurance company which has issued, or in the future may issue policies of
insurance which would be affected by such waiver, and to have such policies

provided by such policies by reason of such waiver.

Building is destroyed by fire, explosion or other casualty, then either
Sublandlord or Subtenant shall have the right to terminate this Sublease by
written notice thereof to the other party, in which event this Sublease shall
terminate effective as of the date of the delivery of such notice. In the event
the Subleased Premises is damaged by fire, explosion or other casualty such
that: (i) twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Subleased Premises is
rendered untenantable, (ii) access to the Subleased Premises is lost or
materially diminished, or (iii) Subtenant reasonably estimates that the time to
complete any restoration of the Subleased Premises will exceed one hundred
twenty (120) days from the occurrence of such casualty, then, in any of the
foregoing cases, Subtenant or Sublandlord may elect to terminate this Sublease
by written notice thereof to the other party, and this Sublease shall terminate
effective as of the date of the delivery of such notice. In the event the damage
to the Subleased Premises is not so extensive, or if Subtenant and/or
Sublandlord elects not to exercise its termination rights pursuant to the
foregoing sentence, Sublandlord shall commence the repair, restoration or
rebuilding of the Building and Subleased

                                       8

<PAGE>

Premises within thirty (30) days after such damage and shall complete such
restoration, repair or rebuilding within one hundred twenty (120) days after
such damage. If Sublandlord fails to timely complete repairs or restoration as
provided in the foregoing sentence, Subtenant shall have the right to terminate
this Sublease by written notice to Sublandlord. In any event, in the event of
fire or other casualty, Rent shall be proportionately abated from the date of
casualty based on the area of the Subleased Premises rendered unsuitable for
Subtenant's general office use.

      15. CONDEMNATION. If the entire Building or a substantial part thereof, or
any part thereof affecting a portion of the Subleased Premises (or any other

services, access or parking to the Subleased Premises), shall be taken or
condemned for a public or quasi-public use or purpose by a competent authority
(whether permanently or temporarily), then Subtenant shall have the right to
terminate this Sublease by written notice to Sublandlord, such termination to be
effective as of the date of taking. In the event Subtenant does not terminate
this Sublease, Base Rent shall be proportionately reduced based on the portion
of the Subleased Premises and/or Real Property taken. All proceeds from any
taking or condemnation of any part of the Building, including but not limited to
the Subleased Premises, shall belong to and be paid to Sublandlord. Sublandlord
shall be entitled to receive the entire award in any proceeding with respect to
any taking without deduction for any estate vested in Subtenant by this Sublease
and Subtenant shall receive no part of such award; provided, however, that
Subtenant shall have the right to file a claim in any condemnation proceeding
for damages relating to relocation costs, loss of property or any alterations or
improvements made by Subtenant.

      16. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING. Subtenant may not (i) assign, transfer,
mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or encumber this Sublease or any interest under
it, or (ii) sublet or permit any other Person to use the Subleased Premises or
any part thereof without the prior written consent of Prime Landlord, if
required under the Prime Lease, and Sublandlord (which consent Sublandlord may
grant or withhold in Sublandlord's sole and absolute discretion).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the foregoing sentence,
Subtenant shall have the right, without Sublandlord's consent (but subject to
obtaining Prime Landlord's consent, if required under the Prime Lease), to
assign this Sublease or sublet all or any portion of the Subleased Premises to:
(a) an Affiliate of Subtenant, (b) any entity in which Subtenant has a

terms and conditions of this Sublease. No assignment or subletting shall release
Subtenant from its duties, obligations and liabilities under this Sublease.

      17. INDEMNITY.

            (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 13(d), above, Subtenant
will protect, indemnify and save Sublandlord harmless from and against all
Losses imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against Sublandlord by reason of
any accident, injury to or death of persons or loss of or damage to property
occurring on or about the Subleased Premises and resulting from any act or
omission of Subtenant or anyone claiming by, through or under Subtenant. In case
any action, suit or proceeding is brought against Sublandlord by reason of any
such occurrence, Subtenant will, at Subtenant's expense, by counsel approved by
Sublandlord (in its reasonable discretion), defend such action, suit or
proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no
event shall Subtenant be required to protect, indemnify, save harmless or defend
Sublandlord from or against any Losses to the extent that such Losses result
from the negligence or intentional misconduct of Sublandlord.

accident, injury to or death of persons or loss of or damage to property
occurring on or about the Real Property other than the Subleased Premises or
resulting from any act or omission of Sublandlord or anyone claiming by, through
or under Sublandlord. In case any action, suit or proceeding is brought against
Subtenant by reason of any such occurrence, Sublandlord will, at Sublandlord's

            (a) Upon the termination of this Sublease, whether by lapse of time
or otherwise, or upon termination of Subtenant's right to possession of the
Subleased Premises, Subtenant will surrender and deliver up the Subleased
Premises, to Sublandlord, in substantially the same condition and repair as the
Subleased Premises was in on the date possession thereof was delivered to
Subtenant, reasonable wear and tear, casualty damage, condemnation, acts and
omissions of Sublandlord and Alterations approved by Sublandlord excepted.

            (b) Upon the termination of this Sublease by lapse of time or
cancellation, Subtenant shall remove Subtenant's personal property from the
Subleased Premises and shall repair any injury or damage to the Subleased
Premises which may result from any such removal.

      19. DEFAULT BY TENANT.

            (a) Subtenant agrees that any of the following events shall be
considered events of default as said term is used herein (any such default,
following expiration of the stated notice and cure period, being referred to
herein as a "Default"):

                  (i) Subtenant shall fail to pay any Rent or other payment due
      hereunder within ten (10) days following receipt of notice from
      Sublandlord that the same is past due; or

                  (ii) Subtenant shall fail to keep, observe or perform any of
      its other covenants or agreements herein contained and such failure shall
      continue for thirty (30) days after notice thereof in writing to Subtenant
      from Sublandlord (or such longer time as may be reasonably necessary in
      the event the failure cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days
      provided Subtenant commences the cure within such thirty (30) day period
      and thereafter diligently pursues such cure to completion).

            (b) Upon the occurrence of a Default, Sublandlord at its election,
may either: (i) terminate this Sublease, or (ii) terminate Subtenant's right of
possession of the Subleased Premises without terminating this Sublease, or (iii)
Sublandlord may collect and sue Subtenant from time to time for the amount of
any Rent or other amounts then owing by Subtenant to Sublandlord pursuant to
this Sublease; or (iv) Sublandlord may do whatever Subtenant is obligated to do
under the terms of this Sublease, in which event Subtenant shall reimburse
Sublandlord on demand for any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by
Sublandlord in carrying out Subtenant's duties and obligations under this
Sublease. Upon termination of this Sublease (or Subtenant's right of possession
of the Subleased Premises), Subtenant shall surrender possession of the
Subleased Premises to Sublandlord in the condition required under this Sublease,
and hereby grants to Sublandlord the right, upon reasonable advance notice to
Subtenant, to enter into and upon the Subleased Premises and in such event to
repossess the Subleased

                                       10

<PAGE>

Premises as Sublandlord's former estate and to expel or remove Subtenant and any
others who may be occupying or within the Subleased Premises without
relinquishing Sublandlord's rights to Rent or any other right given to
Sublandlord hereunder or by operation of law.

            (c) Sublandlord's forbearance in pursuing or exercising one or more
of its remedies shall not be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of any
default or any remedy, and no waiver by Sublandlord of any right or remedy on
one occasion shall be construed as a waiver of that right or remedy on any
subsequent occasion or as a waiver of any right or remedy then or thereafter
existing. No failure of Sublandlord to pursue or exercise any of its rights or
remedies or to insist upon strict compliance by the Subtenant with any term or
provision of this Sublease, and no custom or practice at variance with the terms
of this Sublease, shall constitute a waiver by Sublandlord of the right to
demand strict compliance with the terms and provisions of this Sublease.

            (d) Sublandlord shall in all cases use reasonable efforts to
mitigate its damages under this Sublease.

      20. DEFAULT BY SUBLANDLORD. In the event that Sublandlord fails to keep,

failure shall continue for thirty (30) days after notice thereof in writing to
Sublandlord (or such longer time as may be reasonably necessary in the event the
failure cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days provided Sublandlord
commences the cure within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently
pursues such cure to completion), then in addition to any other right or remedy
existing hereunder or at law or in equity (including, without limitation, the
right to terminate the Sublease), Subtenant shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to perform such covenant or agreement on behalf of Sublandlord and
the costs and expenses incurred by Subtenant in such performance shall be
payable by Sublandlord to Subtenant on demand, and in the absence of such
payment, shall be deducted from the Rent due hereunder.

      21. HOLDOVER. If Subtenant retains possession of the Subleased Premises at
the expiration of the Term, Subtenant shall be deemed to be a tenant at
sufferance subject to immediate eviction, and shall pay Rent equal to one
hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Base Rent applicable for the final month of

recordable form, any reasonable instrument of subordination requested by
Sublandlord to confirm such subordination provided that the holder of any such
mortgage or deed of trust executes and delivers with Subtenant a non-disturbance
agreement and attornment, in commercially reasonable form.

      23. STORAGE SPACE. Subtenant shall have the right, at no additional cost
to Subtenant, to lease storage space in its current location [as depicted in

location, size and

                                       11

<PAGE>

character of the Signage shall be subject to Sublandlord's approval, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

      25. SPECIAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            (a) During the Term, Sublandlord shall provide Subtenant, free of

                  (ii) Subtenant shall install the Additional Communications

      practicable thereafter and, in any event, within thirty (30) days after
      receipt of Sublandlord's notice. The cost of relocating the Additional
      Communications Equipment shall be borne by Subtenant if such relocation
      shall be necessary due to any interference with other installations
      existing on the date the Additional Communications Equipment was installed
      or any Legal Requirements or any act or omission of Subtenant (other

                                       12

      than mere use). If the relocation shall be required for any other reason,

                  (vi) Subtenant hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Sublandlord
      and their respective agents, employees, contractors and representatives,
      harmless from and against any and all cost, claims, damages (including,

      Sublandlord's property), causes of action and liability which may arise by
      reason of any occurrence attributable to or arising out of Subtenant's
      installation, maintenance, repair, operation or removal of any of the
      Existing Communications Equipment and Additional Communications Equipment,
      including without limitation, any claim or cause of action for injury to
      or death of any person or damage to any property arising therefrom, and
      Subtenant agrees to defend any claim or demand against Sublandlord, its
      agents or employees arising out of any such occurrence.

                  (vii) Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this
      Sublease, Subtenant may, at its option, remove the Existing Communications
      Equipment and Additional Communications Equipment and repair all damage to
      the Building caused thereby.

                  (viii) Sublandlord shall not unreasonably withhold, condition
      or delay its approval with respect to any approval right set forth in this

      interfere with Subtenant's use of its Existing Communications Equipment or
      Additional Communications Equipment.

            (b) Sublandlord acknowledges that Subtenant operates its own fiber
optic network for communications, and agrees that Subtenant shall have the right
to maintain Subtenant's existing fiber feed across locations on the Real

to use pursuant to this Sublease).

            (c) Subtenant shall have the right to use existing riser spaces for

            (d) Subtenant shall have the right to continue to use the cable TV
service, and to bring additional cable TV service into the Building in a manner
acceptable to Subtenant and approved by Sublandlord (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

            (e) Subtenant shall have the right to install in the Subleased
Premises and the Building such other additional conduit, cabling, communications
equipment, backup power and other facilities and equipment as may be required,
from time to time, for their intended use subject to the prior written approval
of Sublandlord (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

      26. TERMINATION OPTION. Subtenant shall have the continuing option to
terminate this Sublease upon not less than 60 days' written notice to
Sublandlord.

      27. CONTRACTION RIGHT. Subtenant shall have the continuing right

than thirty (30) days after the date of Subtenant's written notice ("Contraction
Right Notice"), upon and subject to the terms set forth in this Section 27.

      Any Subtenant's Contraction Right Notice shall, once given, be

            reduced to reflect the deletion of the Contraction Space;

            (iv) If Sublandlord or Subtenant so requests, the parties shall
            execute a written amendment to this Sublease, in a form reasonably
            satisfactory to the parties, to reflect such exercise; and

            (v) If the Contraction Space is less than eighty percent (80%) of
            the original Subleased Premises, Subtenant's Contraction Right shall
            apply again to the reduced Subleased Premises and the same
            procedures shall be followed as provided herein for any subsequent
            exercise(s) of the Contraction Right by Subtenant.

      28. MISCELLANEOUS.

            (a) No Waivers of Remedies. The failure of either party to enforce
at any time any provision of this Sublease shall not be construed to be a waiver
of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Sublease or any

provision. No waiver of any breach of this Sublease shall be held to constitute
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

            (i) Relationship of Parties. None of the terms and provisions of
this Sublease shall be deemed to create a partnership between or among the

                                    RECITALS

            WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as
of [        ] [ ], 2006, by and between Seller and [        ] (the "Purchase

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

            1. SCOPE.

shall be a Vendor of On Order Products and Replenishment Merchandise.

            (b) Subject to obtaining any necessary consents or approvals from
Vendors or the owners or licensors of any applicable Third Party Brands, Buyer's
obligations to purchase Inventory Products and On Order Products shall be firm
and not subject to modification or cancellation.

            (c) Buyer acknowledges that: (i) Seller is entering into this
Agreement as an accommodation to Buyer so that Buyer will have sources of supply
for Products and may continue to offer to sell Products bearing Third Party
Brands ("Third Party Branded Products") to retail customers in its stores for up
to six (6) months following the expiration or termination of this Agreement as
more fully set forth herein; (ii) Seller is not a manufacturer of the Products;

Merchandise and Direct Order Merchandise from Vendors; (iv) Seller has agreed
that Buyer may enter into direct business relationships with Vendors of
Replenishment Merchandise and Direct Order Merchandise for the purposes of
acquiring such merchandise; and (v) Buyer will receive the benefits of Seller's
business relationships with Vendors and the owners or licensors of the Third
Party Brands.

            (d) With respect to Third Party Branded Products, Buyer acknowledges
that: (i) Seller does not own the Third Party Brands; (ii) Seller has entered
into license agreements with third parties that impose upon Seller certain
obligations and restrictions with respect to the use of Third Party Brands and
the sale and marketing of the Third Party Branded Products; (iii) Seller must
obtain the consent of the owners or licensors of the Third Party Brands in order
to permit the transfer or sale to Buyer of Third Party Branded Products, and the
resale of the Third Party Branded Products to customers in Buyer's retail
stores; (iv) it shall be necessary for Buyer to take certain actions with
respect to Third Party Branded Products in order to prevent Seller from being in
breach or default of its obligations under its license agreements for the Third
Party Brands; and (v) agreements relating to Third Party Brands may terminate
prior to the expiration or termination of this Agreement (in which case Seller
shall be under no obligation to make such Third Party Branded Products available
to Buyer).

            (e) Subject to any obligations under the license agreements for
Third Party Brands, except for seasonal merchandise and mark-downs for clearance
in the ordinary course of business, and except for Buyer's Products remaining in
Buyer's inventory during the last ninety (90) days of the sell-off period
applicable to such products pursuant to Section 6(d), Buyer will promote, market
and sell the Third Party Branded Products in the Business in the same manner and
to the same extent as the Third Party Branded Products were promoted, marketed
and sold by

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

Buyer prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Buyer shall be responsible for its proportionate share of any
advertising or promotional obligations set forth in any license agreement
between Seller and the owner or licensor of any Third Party Brand in effect as
of the Effective Time and any such license agreement entered into after the
Effective Time with the consent of Buyer with the owner or licensor of a Third
Party Brand. Subject to the consent of the owner or licensor of each Third Party
Brand, Buyer shall sell the Third Party Branded Products to retail customers in
the ordinary course of business only in the retail department stores operated by
Buyer. When and as requested (subject to reasonable notice) by Seller, Buyer
shall take any action deemed reasonably necessary by Seller to protect the
image, reputation and goodwill represented by the Third Party Brands, to enable
Buyer to remain in compliance with its obligations under this Agreement with
respect to the promotion, marketing and sale of Third Party Branded Products,
and to enable Seller to remain in compliance with Seller's obligations under any
license agreement in effect as of the Effective Time and any such license
agreement entered into after the Effective Time with the consent of Buyer with
the owner or licensor of a Third Party Brand. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, when and as requested by Seller, Buyer shall: (i) deliver to
Seller copies of advertising or promotional material for Third Party Branded
Products; and (ii) modify or discontinue any advertising or promotional material
or other activity or practice with respect to the Third Party Branded Products
that is not in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement or Seller's
license agreements for the Third Party Brands.

            (f) Buyer shall not alter any Third Party Brand on any Third Party
Branded Product, apply or use any Third Party Brand on other goods or with
respect to any services, or relabel, retag (to the extent of modifying any
Private Brand or tradename on a tag), modify or repackage the Third Party
Branded Products in any manner. Seller's obligation to deliver or sell to Buyer
any Seller Sourced Products under this Agreement or the Purchase Agreement, or
Buyer's right to purchase from Vendors Replenishment Merchandise or Direct Order
Merchandise, shall be conditioned upon the receipt by Seller of any consent or
approval required under an agreement between Seller and a Vendor or the owner or
licensor of any Third Party Brand. Seller hereby agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain from any Vendors or the owners or licensors of any
applicable Third Party Brand any consents necessary for Seller to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and for Buyer to sell all Third Party Branded
Products in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the requirements
of the license agreements for the Third Party Brands, provided Seller shall not
be obligated to pay any money or provide other consideration to a Vendor or the
owner or licensor of a Third Party Brand in order to obtain any such consent.
The delivery or sale of Third Party Branded Products to Buyer shall not be
deemed to be a grant to Buyer of any right, title, interest or license in and to
the Third Party Brands or other intellectual property rights in the Third Party
Branded Products other than the limited right to promote, market and sell the
Third Party Branded Products in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Buyer shall not seek to register or otherwise contest the ownership of any Third
Party Brand used on the Products.

            (g) Buyer acknowledges that: (i) Seller's agreement with AMC ("AMC
Agreement"), a Vendor of Seller Sourced Products and Replenishment Merchandise,
contains an annual minimum service charge requirement with respect to Seller
Sourced Products to be purchased under this Agreement and Replenishment
Merchandise to be purchased directly by Buyer; and (ii) Seller's license
agreement with the owner or licensor of certain Third Party Brands

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

contain annual minimum royalty obligations with respect to the Retail Sales (as
hereinafter defined) of certain Third Party Branded Products. The quantities of
Seller Sourced Products to be purchased under this Agreement by Seller from AMC
and Replenishment Merchandise to be purchased by Buyer directly from AMC
represent a substantial portion of the goods to be purchased by Seller under the
AMC Agreement. The royalties attributable to certain Third Party Branded
Products to be purchased under this Agreement represent a significant portion of
the Seller's minimum royalty obligations under the applicable license agreements
for the Third Party Brands. Accordingly, Buyer shall be responsible for its
share of any shortfall in meeting the applicable minimums if, in the case of the
AMC Agreement, Buyer's purchases of Seller Sourced Products purchased by Seller
from AMC or Replenishment Merchandise purchased by Buyer from AMC, or in the
case of the license agreements, royalties from Retail Sales of the affected
Third Party Branded Products, fail to meet the minimum amounts set forth on
Exhibit B for the periods indicated; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be
responsible for any portion of the shortfall to the extent that any portion of
such shortfall is attributable to the failure of Seller to obtain from any
Vendors or the owners or licensors of the affected Third Party Brands any
consents or approvals required under any agreement between Seller and a Vendor
or such owner or licensor. Subject to the foregoing, the Buyer's share of a
shortfall shall be: (A) in the case of the AMC Agreement, the amount, if any, by
which the minimum set forth on Exhibit B exceeds the service charges payable to
AMC attributable to the Buyer's actual purchases of Seller Sourced Products and
Replenishment Merchandise sourced through AMC; and (B) in the case of each of
the affected Third Party Branded Products, the amount, if any, by which the
minimum set forth on Exhibit B exceeds the royalties actually paid by Seller
based upon Buyer's Retail Sales of such Third Party Branded Products. For the
purposes of this Agreement, "Retail Sales" shall mean Buyer's gross retail sales
price of the Third Party Branded Products, less amounts granted for returns or
allowances to retail customers who purchase the Third Party Branded Products.
Retail Sales shall not include any sales or use taxes collected by Buyer from a
retail customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be obligated to
pay any shortfall for an applicable period if Seller is not obligated to pay a
shortfall with respect to its contracted minimum to AMC or the owner or licensor
of a Third Party Brand.

            (h) Buyer acknowledges that Seller's license agreement with the
licensor of the Laura Ashley Brands ("Laura Ashley License") expires on December
31, 2007, and that Seller has an obligation for minimum royalties through such
date. On or prior to the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Buyer
shall enter into a sublicense agreement or similar arrangement with Seller under
the terms of which Buyer will be licensed to source Laura Ashley branded
merchandise from third parties, will be obligated to pay the royalties on the
Retail Sales of such merchandise, and will be obligated to pay its proportionate
share of the minimum royalties of Seller determined in accordance with the
principles set forth in Section 1(g). The sublicense will contain such other
terms and conditions as are required under the Laura Ashley License and as are
customary for an agreement of this nature. The sublicense shall be subject to
the consent of the licensor under the terms of the Laura Ashley License.(1)

----------
(1) Seller is planning to negotiate with the licensor of the Laura Ashley Brands
the terms of the sublicense or similar arrangement so Buyer may enter into the
sublicense or similar arrangement prior to the Closing. If that occurs, Section
1(h) as presently drafted will not be applicable.

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

            (i) Buyer shall establish a direct business relationship with each
Vendor of Replenishment Merchandise and Direct Order Merchandise. Seller shall
provide Buyer such information as Buyer may reasonably require to place orders
for Replenishment Merchandise and Direct Order Merchandise and to manage its
relationship with the Vendors of Replenishment Merchandise and Direct Order
Merchandise. The commercial terms for the acquisition of Replenishment
Merchandise and Direct Order Merchandise shall be established between Buyer and
the Vendors, provided such terms shall not create any liability or other
obligation on Seller. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all
orders for Replenishment Merchandise and Direct Order Merchandise shall be
placed by Buyer directly with each Vendor, with invoices for the Replenishment
Merchandise and Direct Order Merchandise to be issued by each Vendor to Buyer,
and payment to be made by Buyer directly to each Vendor. Replenishment
Merchandise and Direct Order Merchandise bearing Third Party Brands shall be
subject to the royalty obligations under Section 2(c). Replenishment Merchandise
purchased from AMC shall be credited against Buyer's portion of the Seller's
annual minimum service charge obligation to AMC under Section 1(g). In
connection therewith, within ten (10) days following the end of each month,
Buyer shall submit to Seller a written report identifying the quantity, Buyer's
fully landed cost and first cost of Replenishment Merchandise purchased from AMC
and delivered to Buyer during the preceding month, and such other information as
Seller may reasonably require.

            (j) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT STATE THE ONLY TERMS
AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SELLER SHALL SELL TO BUYER, AND BUYER SHALL PURCHASE
FROM SELLER, THE SELLER SOURCED PRODUCTS.

            2. PRICE AND SALES REPORTS.

            (a) The price for Inventory Products has been established and shall
be deemed to be subsumed within the purchase price for the Shares purchased
under the Purchase Agreement.

            (b) The price for On Order Products shall be Seller's fully landed
cost for such Products (including the invoice price from each Vendor of On Order
Products, all freight (air, ocean or land), insurance, duties, brokers or agents
fees or commissions, imposts, levies, taxes or other amounts paid by Seller with
respect to the procurement of On Order Products) plus a load factor allocated to
the Products. The load factor shall be fifteen (15%) of the fully landed cost of
the On Order Products, and has been established to enable Seller to recover its
administrative costs applicable to such Products.

            (c) Seller shall pay when due all royalties payable by Seller to the
owners or licensors of the Third Party Brands. Within fifteen (15) days
following the end of a calendar quarter (i.e., each three (3) month period
ending on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year) Buyer
shall submit to Seller a written sales report signed and certified as accurate
in all material respects by an officer of Buyer identifying the Retail Sales of
each category of Third Party Branded Products sold by Buyer during the
applicable quarter. Such report shall be required even if no sales of a
particular Third Party Branded Product have been made in such quarter. In no
event shall Seller's receipt of Buyer's report be deemed to be a

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

waiver of Seller's right to challenge (on behalf of itself or the owner or
licensor of a Third Party Brand) the accuracy of any report or the amount of any
payment due from Buyer.

            3. DELIVERY, TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS.

            (a) Inventory Products shall be deemed to be delivered to Buyer at
the Effective Time. On Order Products shall be deemed to be delivered to Buyer
at such time as the On Order Products are delivered to Seller by a Vendor under
the applicable purchase order or other agreement between Seller and the Vendor.

            (b) Freight, insurance and other costs attributable to the delivery
and sale of On Order Products shall be determined in accordance with Seller's
past practices.

            (c) Title and risk of loss for Inventory Products shall be deemed to
pass to Buyer at the Effective Time. Title and risk of loss for On Order
Products shall be deemed to pass automatically from Seller to Buyer at such time
as title and risk of loss passes from the Vendor to Seller pursuant to the
applicable purchase order or other agreement between Seller and the Vendor.

            (d) Upon receipt Buyer shall have the right to reject any delivery
of On Order Products that is shipped late or that is non-conforming, provided
Buyer pays Seller in full for such Products and indemnifies Seller with respect
to all claims that may arise with respect to such rejection without regard to
any limitations set forth in Section 10(a).

            4. BILLING AND PAYMENT.

            (a) (a) Buyer shall at all times maintain and update on a weekly
basis an irrevocable trade letter(s) of credit ("LOC") for the benefit of Seller
in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller, on behalf of Buyer and its
subsidiaries, branches and divisions receiving On Order Products under this
Agreement from time to time, at such banks or other financial institutions as
are reasonably acceptable to Seller, according to such terms as may be
reasonably designated by Seller from time to time, and in an amount equal to the
total of: (i) the price of the On Order Products determined in accordance with
Section 2(b); plus (ii) the accrued and unpaid royalties due with respect to
Retail Sales of Third Party Branded Products in previous quarters and the
estimated royalties due with respect to actual and projected Retail Sales of
Third Party Branded Products delivered in the current quarter. Seller shall
issue a commercial invoice for payment of the purchase price of On Order
Products after delivery to Buyer of the On Order Products pursuant to Section
3(a) and shall be entitled to draw down on each LOC upon presenting the invoice
to the issuing bank. In addition, in the event that Buyer fails to pay when due
the royalties with respect to Retail Sales of Third Party Branded Products,
Seller shall be entitled to draw down on each LOC upon presenting an invoice for
any such amounts that are due but unpaid to the issuing bank with a copy of such
invoice delivered to Buyer. Buyer shall: (A) provide to Seller the original of
each LOC and amendment thereto; (B) provide to Seller a copy of each notice or
other communication to the bank(s) or other financial institution(s) with
respect to any change, modification, amendment or cancellation of the LOC(s);
(C) notify Seller immediately of any cancellation or modification of the terms
of an LOC; (D) cause each bank or other financial institution to cooperate with
Seller in collecting amounts drawn on the LOC(s) and

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

otherwise provide such information as Seller may reasonably require from time to
time; (E) pay all fees, costs and expenses in connection with the LOC(s); and
(F) provide such other information with respect to Buyer and the LOC(s) as
Seller may reasonably request from time to time. Failure to maintain the LOC(s)
in effect in accordance with this Section 4(a), or to comply with the other
requirements of this Section 4(a), shall constitute a material breach of this
Agreement and Seller may, without liability and in addition to its other
remedies under this Agreement, suspend its obligations hereunder with respect to
all outstanding Purchase Orders for On Order Products until such time as Buyer
complies with the requirements of this Section 4(a) to Seller's reasonable
satisfaction. Seller may issue invoices for On Order Products upon delivery of
such Products to Buyer under the second sentence of Section 3(a).

            (b) Unless paid as provided in Section 4(a), Buyer shall promptly
pay Seller's invoices and other amounts due under this Agreement. Seller will
provide reasonable additional information requested by Buyer in writing
supporting Seller's invoices. Unless directed otherwise by Seller, Buyer shall
pay all invoices or other amounts due, as applicable, in the case of invoices,
not later than fifteen (15) days following receipt by Buyer of Seller's invoice,
or, in the case of other amounts, on the due date. Buyer shall not be entitled
to offset any amounts owing to it by Seller or any of Seller's Affiliates
against amounts payable by Buyer hereunder or under any other agreement or
arrangement. Should Buyer reasonably and in good faith dispute any portion of an
invoice, Buyer shall pay the undisputed portion of the invoice in accordance
with this Section 4(b) and promptly notify Seller in writing of the nature and
basis of the dispute.

            (c) If a bank or other financial institution fails to honor any
amount drawn on an LOC, such failure shall be considered a material breach of
this Agreement (except to the extent of any invoiced amounts reasonably disputed
by Buyer in good faith and of which dispute Buyer has notified Seller and
supported with sufficient information in accordance with the requirements of
this Agreement) and Seller may, without liability, suspend its obligations
hereunder with respect to all undelivered On Order Products until such time as
such invoices have been paid in full. The remedy provided to Seller by this
Section 4(c) shall be without limitation of any other applicable provisions of
this Agreement, including Sections 6(e) and 7. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller shall be entitled to draw the full face amount of any LOC, in prepayment
of the applicable purchase orders, if such LOC: (i) is scheduled to expire
within thirty (30) days; and (ii) has not been replaced with a substitute LOC
that complies with the requirements of Section 4(a).

            (d) All charges and fees to be paid by Buyer to Seller under this
Agreement are exclusive of any applicable taxes required by law to be collected
from Buyer (including withholding, sales, use, excise or services taxes, which
may be assessed on the provision of any services hereunder). If a withholding,
sales, use, excise or services tax is assessed on the delivery or sale of Seller
Sourced Products or the provision of any other services under this Agreement,
Buyer shall pay directly, reimburse or indemnify Seller and its Affiliates for
such tax. The parties shall cooperate with each other in determining the extent
to which any tax is due and owing under the circumstances, and shall provide and
make available to each other any resale certificate, information regarding
out-of-state use of materials, services or sale, and other exemption
certificates or information reasonably requested by the other party.

            (e) All payments required to be made pursuant to this Agreement
shall bear interest from and including: (i) the date ten (10) days following
receipt by Buyer of Seller's

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

invoice for undisputed invoiced amounts (but only in cases in which Buyer has
not paid within ten (10) days following receipt by Buyer of Seller's invoice);
or (ii) the due date with respect to other amounts, in each case to but
excluding the date of payment at a rate equal to one percent (1%) per month, or
such higher rate as Seller may be obligated to pay to an owner or licensor under
a license agreement for a Third Party Brand, or to a Vendor under an applicable
agreement or purchase order. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as
the payment to which it relates is made and shall be calculated on the basis of
the number of days (excluding the payment date) by which the payment date
follows the date such payment is due.

            (f) In order to facilitate the billing and payment provisions of
this Agreement, prior to the completion of the shipment, delivery and payment
for all Products delivered under this Agreement: (i) Seller shall be entitled to
use the payable system of Seller for the tracking of shipments and processing of
all payments for Products; and (ii) Buyer shall provide to Seller the same type
and quality of information with respect to Products that Seller had access to
and utilized prior to the Closing. Buyer shall be responsible for dealing
directly with Vendors concerning invoicing, pricing, quality, quantity and other
matters with respect to Products delivered to Buyer; provided if any such matter
results in a change in an open purchase order between Seller and a Vendor or a
replenishment commitment related thereto, Buyer shall inform Seller of that fact
and provide such information as Seller may require with respect thereto.

            5. BOOKS AND RECORDS; AUDITS.

            (a) Buyer shall prepare and maintain complete and accurate books of
account and records (specifically including without limitation the originals or
copies of documents supporting entries in the books of account and records)
covering all transactions arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Seller
and its duly authorized representatives (or in the case of Third Party Branded
Products, the owner or licensor of the Third Party Brand), upon appropriate
advance notice to Buyer, shall have the right, during regular business hours,
for the duration of this Agreement, and for a term of one (1) year following the
early termination or expiration of this Agreement, to audit said books of
account and records and examine all other documents and materials in the
possession of, or under the control of, Buyer with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement. All such books of account, records and documents shall be
kept available by Buyer for at least one (1) year after the early termination or
expiration of this Agreement.

            (b) If, as a result of any audit of Buyer's books and records, it is
shown that with respect to any calendar quarter during the Term (as hereafter
defined), royalties or minimums paid by Buyer to Seller were: (i) less than the
amounts which should have been paid, Buyer immediately shall pay such shortfall
to Seller together with the interest due under Section 4(e) with respect to the
shortfall; and (ii) greater than the amounts which should have been paid, Seller
shall refund such overpayment to Buyer to the extent Seller is entitled to, or
obtains after utilizing commercially reasonable efforts without incurring any
cost or expense, a refund of the overpayment from a Vendor or the owner or
licensor of a Third Party Brand. If the amount of a shortfall is equal to or
more than the percentage in the applicable license agreement for a Third Party
Brand of the payment actually due Seller, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for the
cost to Seller of such audit.

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

            (c) In addition to any inspection or audit by Seller or an owner or
licensor of a Third Party Brand of the books and records of Buyer under Section
5(a), Buyer shall permit the owner or licensor of a Third Party Brand, as
applicable, to inspect the facilities and operations where Buyer conducts
business activities with respect to Products to the extent required by the
agreement relating to the applicable Third Party Brand.

            6. TERM OF AGREEMENT; TERMINATION.

            (a) This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Time and shall
continue (unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof) through January
31, 2007 ("Term"). This Agreement shall not be subject to renewal.

            (b) Buyer may terminate this Agreement at any time upon written
notice to Seller in the event of a material breach of this Agreement by Seller.
Such termination shall become effective thirty (30) days from the date of
Seller's receipt of such notice unless the breach is cured.

            (c) Seller may terminate this Agreement at any time upon written
notice to Buyer in the event of a material breach of this Agreement by Buyer.
Such termination shall become effective thirty (30) days from the date of
Buyer's receipt of such notice unless the breach is cured; provided, that if
such breach relates to the non-payment by Buyer of any amount due under Section
4, then termination under this Section 6(c) shall be effective twenty (20) days
from the date of receipt of notice of breach from Seller unless all unpaid fees
or expenses that are in payment default have been paid in full within such
20-day period.

            (d) Following the expiration of this Agreement under Section 6(a) or
the termination of this Agreement by Buyer under Section 6(b), but subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Seller shall continue to deliver any
previously undelivered On Order Products. Following any termination of this
Agreement by Seller under Section 6(c), but subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, Seller may elect to continue to deliver any previously
undelivered On Order Products, provided under no circumstances shall Seller be
obligated to do so. Buyer shall continue to maintain the LOC(s) required under
Section 4(a) until Buyer has paid for all Seller Sourced Products delivered by
Seller following the expiration or termination of this Agreement. Subject to
Sections 1(c) through 1(h), Section 1(j), Section 2(c) and Section 4, Buyer
shall have six (6) months following the expiration or termination of this
Agreement to sell off its inventory of Third Party Branded Products, or such
longer or shorter period as may be permitted under an applicable license
agreement for the Third Party Brand.

            (e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, whether this Agreement expires or is terminated by Seller or Buyer, or
whether this Agreement is subject to a partial termination under Section 7,
Buyer shall remain liable for the payment of all amounts due with respect to
Products delivered under the terms of this Agreement, even though Products may
not be delivered or sold until after such expiration or termination. Further, in
the event of expiration or termination of this Agreement, Sections 1(e) through
1(i), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11 and 13 through 22 shall continue in full force
and effect; provided that Sections 1(g) and 1(h) shall not survive if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6(b).

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

            7. PARTIAL TERMINATION. Subject to Section 6(d), this Agreement
shall automatically terminate with respect to: (i) any category of Third Party
Branded Product upon the expiration or termination for any reason of the
applicable license agreement between Seller and the owner or licensor of the
Third Party Brand; or (ii) any other Product affected by the expiration or
termination of a purchase order, sourcing or other agreement between Seller and
a Vendor of the Product.

            8. CONFIDENTIALITY. Each party shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates and each of its and their officers, directors and employees to, hold
all information relating to the business of the other party disclosed to it by
reason of this Agreement (the "Confidential Information") confidential, and
shall not disclose or permit to be disclosed any such Confidential Information
to any third party unless legally required to disclose such information;
provided, however, that to the extent that a Person receiving Confidential
Information hereunder may receive the written advice of outside counsel that
disclosure of any Confidential Information is required in order that such Person
not commit a violation of law, such Person: (a) to the extent not inconsistent
with such Person's obligation to disclose, will give the other party hereto
prompt notice of such request so that such party may seek an appropriate
protective order; (b) may only disclose such information if it shall first have
used commercially reasonable efforts to, and, if practicable, shall have
afforded the other party the opportunity to, obtain an appropriate protective
order or other satisfactory assurance of confidential treatment for the
information required to be so disclosed; and (c) if such protective order or
other remedy is not obtained, or the other party waives such Person's compliance
with the provisions of this Section 8, shall only furnish that portion of the
Confidential Information which is legally required to be so disclosed. As used
herein, "Confidential Information" does not include any information that: (i) is
or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by the party receiving the Confidential Information in violation of
this Agreement; (ii) was available to the receiving party on a non-confidential
basis prior to its disclosure by the disclosing party; (iii) becomes available
to the receiving party from a Person other than the disclosing party or its
Affiliates who is not, to the receiving party's knowledge, subject to any
legally binding obligation to keep such information confidential; or (iv) such
party demonstrates is or was independently developed by or on behalf of a party
without the direct or indirect use of any of the other party's Confidential
Information.

            9. THIRD PARTY NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS. To the extent that any
information disclosed under this Agreement requires a specific form of
non-disclosure agreement under the terms of an applicable license agreement for
a Third Party Brand as a condition of its disclosure or use, Buyer shall execute
(and shall cause Buyer's employees to execute, if and to the extent required)
any such form in substantially the same form executed by Seller (if required).
To the extent Buyer reasonably requires information with respect to a license
agreement for a Third Party Brand, Seller will use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide such information, subject to obtaining any necessary consent
from the licensor. Buyer acknowledges that a licensor may grant or withhold any
such consent in its sole discretion.

            10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; DISCLAIMER; INDEMNITY.

            (a) Neither party nor their respective Affiliates shall be liable to
the other party and its Affiliates or any third party for any special,
incidental, consequential (including loss

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

of revenues or profits), exemplary or punitive damages arising from any claim
relating to this Agreement or any of the Products to be provided hereunder or
the performance of or failure to perform such party's obligations under this
Agreement, whether such claim is based on warranty, contract, tort (including
negligence or strict liability) or otherwise, all of which are hereby excluded
by agreement of the parties regardless of whether or not a party to this
Agreement has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Any of the
foregoing categories of damages Seller is required to pay a third party on
account of or attributable to Buyer's conduct shall be deemed to be direct
damages of Seller and not subject to the previous sentence. SELLER SPECIFICALLY
DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARISING OUT OF OR
related to this Agreement, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller's cumulative aggregate liability to Buyer and its Affiliates under this
Agreement shall not exceed the amount paid for the Products giving rise to the
claim unless such claim arises from fraud or willful misconduct of Seller or its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
limitations set forth in this Section 10(a) shall not apply with respect to any
breach of Section 8.

            (b) Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates against all
Losses attributable to: (i) third party claims arising from or relating to the
activities contemplated by this Agreement to the extent that such Losses arise
from the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective employees, officers or directors; and (ii)
product liability claims involving personal injury or property damage arising
out of the use of any Product. With respect to product liability claims, nothing
in the foregoing indemnity shall preclude Buyer from seeking recourse against
the manufacturer of any Product giving rise to the claim.

            (c) Seller shall indemnify Buyer and each of its Affiliates against
all Losses attributable to any third party claims arising from or relating to
the activities contemplated by this Agreement to the extent that such Losses
arise from the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller, any of
its Affiliates or any of their respective employees, officers or directors.

            (d) All claims for indemnification pursuant to this Section 10 shall
be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sections 10.3 and 10.5 of
the Purchase Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10
or any provision set forth in the Purchase Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not be limited in any recovery of Losses under this Agreement by any
provision set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and any Losses paid by Seller to
Buyer or its Affiliates under this Agreement shall not be counted for purposes
of any aggregate damage limitations set forth in the Purchase Agreement. In
addition, for the avoidance of doubt, no Loss suffered by Buyer or its
Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement shall be counted for purposes of
satisfying the deductibles set forth in the proviso to Section 10.1(a) of the
Purchase Agreement.

            (e) At their expense, Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, shall each procure and maintain in full force and effect at all
times during which the Products are being sold by Buyer, and for a period of one
(1) year thereafter, with responsible insurance carriers acceptable to the other
party at least Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) of products

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

liability insurance coverage with respect to their sale of the Products. Such
insurance coverage shall name the other party and the owner or licensor of each
Third Party Brand as an additional insured and shall provide for a minimum of
twenty (20) days prior written notice to the other party in the event that the
insurance carrier intends to cancel or substantially reduce the insurance
coverage. Such insurance coverage may be obtained in conjunction with a policy
of product liability insurance which covers other products manufactured and/or
sold by a party. Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall
each also procure and maintain during the Term of this Agreement and for a
period of one (1) year thereafter, at least the minimum business insurance
coverages, including but not limited to bodily injury, property damage, workers
compensation, business interruption and general liability that are required by
the laws and regulations of any jurisdiction in which Seller or Buyer sell the
Products. Upon request, Seller and Buyer shall furnish or cause to be furnished
to the other party a certificate(s) of insurance evidencing the maintenance of
the insurance coverages required by this Section 10(e).

            11. RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES. The contractual relationship between
the parties established under this Agreement is solely that of seller and
purchaser. Except as specifically provided herein, neither party shall: (a) act
or represent or hold itself out as having authority to act as an agent or
partner of the other party; or (b) in any way bind or commit the other party to
any obligations or agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
construed as creating a partnership, joint venture, agency, trust, fiduciary
relationship or other association of any kind, each party being individually
responsible only for its obligations as set forth in this Agreement. The
parties' respective rights and obligations hereunder shall be limited to the
contractual rights and obligations expressly set forth herein on the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

            12. FORCE MAJEURE. If Seller, any of its Affiliates or any Vendor is
prevented from or delayed in complying, either totally or in part, with any of
the terms or provisions of this Agreement by reason of fire, flood, storm,
strike, walkout, lockout or other labor trouble or shortage, delays by
unaffiliated suppliers or carriers, shortages of fuel, power, raw materials or
components, any law, order, proclamation, regulation, ordinance, demand, seizure
or requirement of any governmental authority, riot, civil commotion, war,
rebellion, acts of terrorism, nuclear accident or other causes beyond the
reasonable control of any such Person or other acts of God, or acts, omissions
or delays in acting by any governmental or military authority or Buyer, then
upon notice to Buyer, the affected provisions and/or other requirements of this
Agreement shall be suspended during the period of such disability and Seller
shall have no liability to Buyer, its Affiliates or any other Person in
connection therewith. Seller and Buyer shall make commercially reasonable
efforts to remove such disability within thirty (30) days after giving notice of
such disability; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 12 will be
construed to require the settlement of any strike, walkout, lockout or other
labor dispute on terms which, in the reasonable judgment of Seller, are contrary
to its interest. It is understood that the settlement of a strike, walkout,
lockout or other labor dispute will be entirely within the discretion of Seller.

            13. NOTICES. All notices or other communications required or
permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally, by
facsimile or sent by private courier or by registered or certified mail, and
shall be deemed given when so delivered personally, by facsimile or by private
courier or, if mailed, two business days after the mailing,

            14. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The rights under this Agreement shall
not be assignable by Buyer and the duties shall not be delegated by Buyer
without the prior written consent of Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. Except
for the rights afforded owners or licensors of Third Party Brands expressly set
forth herein, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended or
shall

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

be construed to confer upon any Person other than the parties and successors and
assigns permitted by this Section 14 any right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement.

            15. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENTS. This Agreement and the Exhibits
attached hereto and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto contain the
entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter
contained herein or therein, and supersede all other prior representations,
warranties, agreements, understandings or letters of intent between or among any
of the parties hereto (it being understood, however, that the Purchase Agreement
and agreements contemplated thereby set forth certain additional understandings
between Seller and [_______] regarding the relationship between Seller and Buyer
after the Effective Time). This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or
supplemented except by a written instrument signed by an authorized
representative of the parties hereto.

            16. PARTIAL INVALIDITY. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating
the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions
or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be
unreasonable.

            17. WAIVERS. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived,
or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party,
it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The
failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any
way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of
any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any
breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach.

            18. EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument, but all
of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to Seller and Buyer.
