Article 2 
 [Intentionally omitted]

  



  



  

Article 3 
 THE MERGER

  



  

Section 3.01. _The Merger_. (a) Upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged (the
"Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law,
whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

  



  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 10, the closing of the Merger
(the "Closing" and the date on which the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date")
shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell
LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 at 10:00 a.m. New York
time, on the third Business Day after the satisfaction or (to the extent
permissible) waiver by the party or parties entitled

  



    

15

 

    

to the benefit thereof of the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those
conditions at the Closing); provided, that notwithstanding the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 10, Parent shall not be
required to effect the Closing until the earlier of (i) a date during the
Marketing Period specified by Parent on no less than three Business Days'
prior written notice to the Company (provided, that the Closing on such date
may be postponed by Parent to another date during the Marketing Period (or on
or before the second Business Day following the final day of the Marketing
Period) to permit the contemporaneous consummation of the Financing), and
(ii) the second Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period
(as it may be extended pursuant to the definition of "Marketing Period")
(subject, in each case, to the satisfaction or waiver in writing of all of
the conditions set forth in Article 10 as of the date determined pursuant to
this Section 3.01(b)), or at such other place, at such other time or on such
other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree.

  



  

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall file a certificate
of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Delaware Secretary of State
and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time
(the "Effective Time") as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be specified in the
Certificate of Merger).

  



  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware Law.

  



  

(e) At the Closing, all indebtedness and other amounts of any kind owing
as of the Closing Date under the Credit Agreement will be fully repaid with
immediately available funds in accordance with the Payoff Letter.

  



  

Section 3.02. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time:

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.02(b) or Section 3.04, each
share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company (collectively, the
"Shares") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $29.25 per
Share (such amount, the "Merger Consideration") without interest. As of the
Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each of
them shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock (other than Shares
in a Company Plan) or owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto (the

  



    

16

 

    

"Cancelled Shares"). Each Share held by any Subsidiary of the Company (or any
Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub)) immediately prior to the
Effective Time, if any, shall be converted into such number of shares of stock
of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same
percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Converted Shares" and
together with the Cancelled Shares, the "Excluded Shares").

  



  

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation (except for
any such shares resulting from the conversion of Converted Shares, if any,
pursuant to Section 3.02(b)).

  



  

Section 3.03. _Surrender and Payment_. (a) Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited, with a
nationally recognized financial institution selected by Parent with the
Company's prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the Company's stockholders
(other than holders of Dissenting Shares or Excluded Shares), a cash amount
in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make
payments contemplated by Section 3.02(a) (such cash being referred to as the
"Exchange Fund"). With respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall only be
required to deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent
funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such Dissenting Shares if the holder thereof fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or losses its appraisal rights under the DGCL. The
Paying Agent shall also act as the agent for the Company's stockholders for
the purpose of receiving and holding the stockholders'(i) certificates
representing Shares (the "Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated Shares
represented by book-entry (the "Uncertificated Shares") but shall acquire no
rights or interests in Shares represented thereby. The Paying Agent agreement
pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall be in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent. The Paying Agent
shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange
Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section 3.02(a)
shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation. The Paying Agent
shall make delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration out of the
Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) (i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within two
(2) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate representing
Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal in
customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section

  



    

17

 

    

3.08) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree,
and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.08) in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.08) to the Paying
Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.07) equal to
(x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.08) _multiplied_ by (y) the
Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the
case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent
after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder
of Uncertificated Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
3.02(a). In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Uncertificated
Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's
message" in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in respect of each such
Share, and the Uncertificated Shares of such holder shall forthwith be
cancelled.

  



  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 3.

  



  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying
Agent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that

  



    

18

 

    

remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares twelve months after the Effective
Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has
not exchanged such Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Section 3.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable
to any holder of Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  



  

Section 3.04. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 3.02, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder
who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and
who has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares ("Dissenting Shares") in
accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to
appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. As of the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to seek appraisal under Delaware
Law. The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and right to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of
Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to
settle or settle, any such demands. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost its rights under Section 262 of
Delaware Law with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares
shall thereupon be treated as though they had been converted into the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 3.02(a).

  



  

Section 3.05. _Treatment of Equity Awards_. Except as otherwise agreed in
writing between Parent and a holder of an option to purchase Shares
granted under any Company Plan (each, a "Company Option"), each Company
Option, whether vested or unvested and whether subject to time-based or
performance-based vesting, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder of such Company Option, become fully vested and exercisable as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be cancelled in exchange
for the right to receive a cash payment from Parent to the holder thereof,
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
less the applicable per share exercise price of such Company Option
_multiplied by_ (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Company Option,
payable at the next practicable payroll of the Company following the
Effective Time.

  



    

19

 

    

(b) Except as otherwise agreed in writing between Parent and a holder of a
restricted stock unit, performance stock unit or similar right granted under
any employee or director plans or arrangements payable in Shares or the value
of which is determined with reference to the value of Shares granted under
any Company Plan (each, a "Company Stock Unit") which is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which has vested (or by its terms
is scheduled to vest) as of or prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Vested
Company Stock Unit")) shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder of such Vested Company Stock Unit, be cancelled in exchange for the
right to receive a cash payment from Parent to the holder thereof equal to the
product of (i) the Merger Consideration _multiplied by_ (ii) the number of
Shares underlying such Vested Company Stock Unit, payable at the next
practicable payroll of the Company following the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise agreed in writing between Parent and a holder of a
Company Stock Unit, at the Effective Time, each Company Stock Unit which is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and which has not
vested as of or prior to the Effective Time (each, an "Unvested Company Stock
Unit") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of such Unvested Company Stock
Unit, be cancelled, and in substitution thereof, such holder will be eligible
to receive a cash payment from Parent (the "RSU Payment") equal to the
product of (i) the Merger Consideration _multiplied by_ (ii) the number of
Shares underlying such Unvested Company Stock Unit, which, for any Unvested
Company Stock Unit subject to satisfaction of performance criteria, shall be
calculated assuming satisfaction of such criteria at target achievement. The
RSU Payment shall initially be unvested, and (i) to the extent such payment
relates to an Unvested Company Stock Unit that was subject to time-based
vesting, shall vest, subject to continued employment or service, based on the
same vesting schedule applicable to such cancelled Unvested Company Stock
Unit, and (ii) to the extent such payment relates to an Unvested Company
Stock Unit that was subject to performance-based vesting, shall vest, subject
to continued employment or service, on the last day of the performance period
applicable to such cancelled Unvested Company Stock Unit, in each case
subject to any applicable vesting of such Unvested Company Stock Units upon a
termination of the holder's employment under the applicable Company Plan and
award agreement relating to the original Unvested Company Stock Unit.

  



  

(d) The Company shall take all actions necessary to provide for the
continuation of, and shall not cause or permit the termination prior to the
Closing of, the OncoMed Specialty 2014 Phantom Stock Plan, the Amerita, Inc.
2013 Stock Appreciation Rights Plan, such that all awards issued thereunder
shall remain outstanding and no acceleration of vesting with respect to any
such awards occurs as a result of the transactions contemplated herein.

  



  

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board or committee
thereof, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that
are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.05.

  



    

20

 

    

Section 3.06. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class (including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange or readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record
date during such period, but excluding any change that results from any
exercise of Company Options or settlement of Vested Company Stock Units), the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

Section 3.07. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent (and any of their Affiliates) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over
to the applicable Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of
which the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be, made such deduction and withholding.

  



  

Section 3.08. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 3.

  



  

Article 4 
 The Surviving Corporation

  



  

Section 4.01.   _Certificate of Incorporation_. Subject to Section 8.03, the
certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended as set forth in
_Exhibit A_ at the Effective Time and, as so amended, shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance
with Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 4.02. _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, and without any further
action on the part of the Company or Merger Sub, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
in accordance with their terms, the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and as provided by Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 4.03. _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time,
until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in
accordance with Applicable

  



    

21

 

    

Law, (a) the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation and (b) the officers of the Company at
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Article 5 
 Representations and Warranties of the Company

  



  

Except as (i) disclosed in any Company SEC Document filed at least two
Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement (but excluding any
disclosures set forth in any "risk factors" section and any "forward-looking
statements" in any other section; it being understood that any factual
information contained within such sections shall not be excluded); provided
that nothing in the Company SEC Documents shall be deemed to be disclosures
against Section 5.01, Section 5.02 or Section 5.05 and only those Company SEC
Documents filed after December 31, 2016 shall be deemed to be disclosures
against Section 5.10, and (ii) subject to Section 12.05, as set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Parent
that:

  



  

Section 5.01. _Corporate Existence and Power_. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers required to carry on its
business as now conducted, except for any failure to be in good standing and
any failure to have such powers as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where the conduct of its business in
such jurisdiction, as currently conducted, requires such qualification,
except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, as currently in effect, are included in the Company
SEC Documents and the Company is not in violation of any of such documents.

  



  

Section 5.02. _Corporate Authorization_. (a) The execution, delivery and,
assuming the representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.10
are true and correct and the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, the
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Company's
corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company. The Company has duly executed and delivered
this Agreement, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
each of Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms (except insofar as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
Applicable Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors'
rights, or by principles governing the availability of equitable remedies,
whether considered in suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity
(collectively, the "Enforceability Exceptions")).

  



    

22

 

    

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Board has duly and unanimously
adopted resolutions, which have not subsequently been rescinded or modified
in any way, adopting each of the Board Actions and the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate actions and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated other than
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding Shares on the record date for the Stockholders Meeting (the
"Stockholder Approval") and the filing with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware of the Certificate of Merger required by Delaware Law.

  



  

Section 5.03. _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing by the Company with, any Governmental Authority, other
than (a) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and of
Applicable Law analogous to the HSR Act existing in jurisdictions outside of
the United States, (b) compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1933
Act, the 1934 Act and any other applicable securities laws, (c) the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of the other
jurisdictions in which the Company is qualified to do business, (d)
compliance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE and (e) any other
actions or filings (i) required solely by reason of the participation of
Parent or Merger Sub (as opposed to any Third Party) in the transactions
contemplated hereby or (ii) the absence of which would not reasonably be

case under any Company Plan, result in the payment of any amount that could,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, constitute an

limit or restrict the right of the Company or, after the Closing, Parent to
merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Plans.

or other agreement provides any individual with the right to, a "gross-
up", indemnification, reimbursement or other payment for any excise or
additional taxes, interests or penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A or
under Section 4999 of the Code or due to the failure of any payment to such
disqualified individual to be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

  



  

(f) No action, suit, investigation, audit, proceeding or claim (other than
routine claims for benefits) is pending against or involves or, to the
Company's knowledge, is threatened against or threatened to involve, any
Company Plan before any Governmental Authority that, individually or in the
aggregate, if determined or resolved adversely in accordance with the

the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects with its respective
obligations under Applicable Law or any agreement with any labor union

date hereof, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default, breach or failure to satisfy a
condition precedent on the part of Parent or any of its Affiliates or, to the
knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, in each case, under the terms
and conditions of the Commitment Letters, other than any such default, breach
or failure that has been waived by the lenders or otherwise cured in a timely
manner by Parent to the satisfaction of the lenders, and, assuming (A) the
accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Article V, (B) the
performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of their obligations
contained in this Agreement and (C) the conditions set forth in Section 10.01
and Section 10.02 are satisfied at Closing, Parent has no reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letters will not be satisfied on a timely basis. There are no side letters,
other agreements, contingencies or conditions precedent to the obligations of
counterparties to the Commitment Letter to provide the Financing or that would
permit such counterparties to reduce the total amount of the Financing,
except as set forth or described in the Commitment Letters. The aggregate
proceeds of the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing and the cash or cash
equivalents held by Parent and the Company, as of the Effective Time, will be
sufficient to enable Parent and Merger Sub to pay in cash all amounts required
to be paid by them in cash on the Closing Date in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and to pay their respective related fees and
expenses (the "Required Amount").

  



  

(c) Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that their
obligations hereunder, including their obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, are not subject to, or conditioned on,
receipt of financing.

Section 6.08. _Limited Guarantee; Support Agreement_. (a) Concurrently with
the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company
a limited guarantee of each Equity Investor, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, in favor of the Company with respect to certain obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement (each, a "Limited Guarantee"). Each
Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the respective Equity Investor party thereto,
enforceable (except insofar as such enforceability may be limited by the
Enforceability Exceptions) against such Equity Investor in accordance with
its terms. As of the date hereof, there is no default under the Limited
Guarantees by the Equity Investors, and no event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default thereunder
by the Equity Investors.

  



  

(b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Equity
Investors have delivered to the Company the Support Agreement, dated as of
the date of this Agreement, in favor of the Company. The Support Agreement is
in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Equity Investors, enforceable (except insofar as such enforceability may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions) against the Equity Investors in
accordance with its terms. As of the date hereof, there is no default under
the Support Agreement by the Equity Investors, and no event has occurred that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
thereunder by the Equity Investors.

  



  

Section 6.09. _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no claim,
action, suit or proceeding pending against, or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened in writing against, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries before (or,
in the case of threatened actions, suits or proceedings, that would be
before) or by any Governmental Authority, or any order, injunction, judgment,
decree or ruling of any Governmental Authority outstanding against the
Parent, in each case, except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 6.10. _Ownership of Shares_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, or
at any time during the last three years has been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company within the meaning of Section 203 of Delaware
Law. Prior to and as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub has taken, or authorized any Representative of Parent or Merger Sub to
take, or has knowledge that any Representative of Parent or Merger Sub has
taken, any action that would cause either Parent or Merger Sub to be deemed an
"interested stockholder" within the meaning of Section 203 of Delaware Law.
Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their affiliates or associates
(as defined in Section 203 of Delaware Law) owns (within the meaning of
Section 203 of Delaware Law) any Shares or holds any rights to acquire any
Shares, except pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.11. _Absence of Certain Agreements_. As of the date hereof,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any contract,
arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or
authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any contract, arrangement or
understanding (in each case, whether oral or

  



    

44

 

    

written), pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company would be entitled
to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger
Consideration.

  



  

Section 6.12. _Management Agreements_. Other than this Agreement, as of the
date hereof, there are no contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements or
obligations or understandings between Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Company's management or
the Board, on the other hand, relating in any way to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Company after the
Effective Time.

  



  

Section 6.13. _Acknowledgement of No Other Representations and Warranties._
Except for the representations and warranties set forth in Article 5, each
of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that no representation or
warranty of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, at law or in equity, is
made or shall be deemed to have been made by or on behalf of the Company to
Parent or Merger Sub, and each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby disclaims
reliance on any such other representation or warranty, whether by or on behalf
of the Company, and notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to Parent or
Merger Sub, or any of their Representatives or Affiliates, of any
documentation or other information by the Company or any of its
Representatives or Affiliates with respect to any one or more of the
foregoing. Each of Parent and Merger Sub also acknowledges and agrees that the
Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to any projections,
forecasts or other estimates, plans or budgets of future revenues, expenses or
expenditures, future results of operations (or any component thereof), future
cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial condition (or any
component thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the future
business, operations or affairs of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to Parent, Merger Sub
or their respective Representatives or Affiliates.

the Company and its Subsidiaries. Any investigation pursuant to this Section

subject to the use and disclosure provisions set forth in the confidentiality
agreement dated as of September 9, 2015 between the Company and KKR and the

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (the "Confidentiality Agreements") as if the
Confidentiality Agreements were in effect until earlier of the Closing and the
End Date.

  



  

Section 7.03. _No-Solicitation_. (a) From the date hereof until the
Effective Time, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their

48

 

    

an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate

Proposal Documentation") (any of the foregoing in clauses (iii) and (iv),
an "Adverse Recommendation Change"). The Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, release or permit the release of any Person from,
waive or permit the waiver of any right under, fail to enforce any provision
of, or grant any consent or make any election under, any confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreement with any Person with respect to any class of
equity securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries, unless the Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law and such release is limited to the extent
reasonably necessary to allow such Person to make a confidential Acquisition
Proposal to the Board and such release is conditioned upon the Company being
able to share such confidential Acquisition Proposal with Parent.

  



  

(b) The Company shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
return or the destruction of, in accordance with the terms of the applicable
confidentiality agreement and to the extent the Company is entitled to have
such information returned or destroyed, confidential information previously
furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their respective
Representatives to any such Person in connection with the consideration of
any Acquisition Proposal and (ii) cause any physical or virtual data room to
no longer be accessible to any such Person in connection with the

their respective Affiliates and Representatives.

  



  

(c) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding Section 7.03(a), at any time prior to
the receipt of the Stockholder Approval:

  



  

(i) If, after receipt of a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (if the
Company did not materially violate Section 7.03(a)) from any Person or group,
the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal

  



    

49

 

    

counsel and financial advisers, that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is
reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal and that failure to take
the actions set forth in clauses (A) or (B) would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, the Company,
directly or indirectly through any of its Representatives or other
intermediaries, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third
Party with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and (B) furnish to such Third
Party or its Representatives non-public information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
a Third Party Confidentiality Agreement;  _provided_ that all such
information (to the extent that such information has not been previously
provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to
Parent, as the case may be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the
time it is provided or made available to such Third Party and that the
Company complies with Section 7.03(d);

  



  

(ii) the Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if, after receipt
of a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (if the Company did not
materially violate Section 7.03(a)) from any Person or group that has not been
withdrawn, (X) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisers, that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal (and continues to be a Superior Proposal
after the Company has complied with Section 7.03(e)) and failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law and (Y) the Company has complied in all material respects with Sections
7.03(d) and (e); and

  



  

(iii) the Company may terminate this Agreement to enter into Acquisition
Proposal Documentation with respect to a Superior Proposal if, after receipt
of a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (if the Company did not materially
violate Section 7.03(a)) from any Person or group that has not been
withdrawn, (X) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisers, that such Acquisition Proposal
is a Superior Proposal (and continues to be a Superior Proposal after the
Company has complied with Section 7.03(e)) and failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (Y) the
Company has complied in all material respects with Sections 7.03(d) and (e);
and (Z) the Company pays in immediately available funds the Company
Termination Fee to Parent concurrently with such termination.

  



  

In addition, without prejudice to the provisions of Section 7.03(a) or
Section 7.03(c) and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company or the Board may (i) take and disclose to the
Company's stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the 1934 Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer) or make any legally required disclosure to stockholders with
regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or an Acquisition
Proposal ( _provided_

  



    

50

 

    

that neither the Company nor the Board may recommend any Acquisition Proposal
unless permitted by this Section 7.03(c)), (ii) issue a "stop, look and
listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act or (iii) contact and engage in discussions with
any Person or group and their respective Representatives who has made an
Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in breach of this Section 7.03
solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and the terms
thereof to determine whether there is a reasonable probability that such
Acquisition Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal.

  



  

"Third Party Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement
with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that such confidentiality agreement may
contain a provision that does no more than permit the counterparty to make a
confidential proposal to the Company; provided that such
confidentiality agreement shall permit the Company to share such proposal to
Parent. To the extent the Company enters into such confidentiality agreement,
the Confidentiality Agreements shall be deemed to be amended to contain only
such less restrictive provision.

  



  

(d) _Required Notices_. The Company shall notify Parent within twenty-
four (24) hours after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives)
of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Person that has notified the Company that it may be
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall
include the identity of such Person, the material terms of any Acquisition
Proposal and copies of any written materials submitted in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal and the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of
the status and material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal
(including any change to the financial terms or other material changes to the
terms thereof and by providing to Parent copies of any material written
materials relating to such Acquisition Proposal that have not already been so
provided) or the nature of any information requested of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with respect thereto.

  



  

(e) _Last Look_. Neither the Board nor the Company shall make an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 7.03(c)(ii) or terminate this
Agreement to enter into Acquisition Proposal Documentation with respect to a
Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 7.03(c)(iii) unless, promptly after the
Board has made the determination set forth in clause (X) of Section
7.03(c)(ii) and/or clause (X) of Section 7.03(c)(iii) following receipt of a
bona fide Acquisition Proposal (so long as the Company did not
materially violate Section 7.03(a)), (i) the Company shall have notified
Parent (the "Determination Notice"), in writing and at least three Business
Days prior to taking such action, of its intention to take such action,
specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for the Adverse Recommendation
Change and/or the reasons the Company intends to terminate this Agreement
(including, in each case, a description of the identity of the Person making
the Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal and copies of the most recent drafts of any Acquisition Proposal

  



    

51

 

    

Documentation), (ii) the Company shall have given Parent three Business Days
after the delivery of the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that such Acquisition
Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal and, if requested by
Parent, the Company shall have negotiated with Parent in good faith during
such three Business Day period, (iii) after considering the proposals made by
Parent, the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, such Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that failure to make the
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law. The provisions of this Section 7.03(e) shall also apply
to any revision to the financial terms of any Acquisition Proposal or other
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal and any such revision or
amendment shall require the delivery of a new Determination Notice, except
that all references in this Section 7.03(e) to three Business Days shall be
deemed to be two Business Days.

  



  

(f) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means a  _bona fide_ , unsolicited Acquisition Proposal
for at least a majority of the outstanding Shares or all or substantially
all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on terms
that the Board determines in good faith (after taking into account any
revisions to the terms of the transaction proposed by Parent including as
contemplated by Section 7.03(e)), after consulting with the Company's outside
legal and financial advisors), is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms, and would, if consummated, result in a transaction
more favorable to the Company's stockholders (in their capacities as such)
from a financial point of view than the Merger (after taking into account any
revisions to this Agreement made or agreed to by Parent in writing prior to
the time of such determination).

any action that is intended to, or would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



    

52

former directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries and agents of the Company

costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) in
respect of the Indemnified Persons' having served in such capacity prior to
the Effective Time, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware

investigation in each case to the extent the Company is required to do so and
on the same terms as provided in the Company's bylaws as of the date hereof.

  



  

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of

agents and advancement of fees, costs and expenses that are no less
advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
in existence on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and comply with their respective
obligations under any indemnification agreement with any Indemnified Person
that were provided to Parent prior to the date hereof, and not amend, repeal
or otherwise modify any such agreement in any manner that would adversely
affect any right of any Indemnified Person thereunder.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies

  



    

53

 

    

and the Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies
(collectively, "DandO Insurance"), which DandO Insurance shall (i) be for a
claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) be from an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance and (iii) have terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided
under the Company's existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged
error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of
duty or any matter claimed against an Indemnified Person by reason of him or
her having served in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as
of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in
effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time,
the DandO Insurance in place with the Company's current insurance carrier or
with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies, or the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase from the Company's current insurance carrier or
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance comparable
DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided in the
Company's existing policies; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to
this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the premium
amount per annum for the Company's existing policies; and _provided, further_
, that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to
the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  



  

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.03.

  



  

(f) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 8.03 shall
be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

  



    

54

 

    

Section 8.04. _Employee Matters._ (a) For a period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (or,
such shorter period of employment, as the case may be), each Company Service
Provider who continues to provide services to Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (each, a "Continuing Employee") shall receive
from Parent or Merger Sub (i) salary, annual cash bonus opportunity, wages or
commissions as whole that is no less favorable than the salary, annual cash
bonus opportunity, wages or commissions as whole provided to such Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee
benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate, as applicable,
provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing
Date under the Company Plans.

  



  

(b) With respect to any Continuing Employee whose employment is
terminated by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (or, such shorter period of employment, as
the case may be), Parent shall provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, termination-related payments and benefits to such Continuing
Employee, that are no less favorable than those provided under any Company
Plan; _provided _ that, Parent's obligation to provide such Continuing
Employee with such termination-related payments and benefits shall be subject
to such Continuing Employee's execution, delivery and non-revocation of a
customary general release in favor of the Company, Parent and their
respective Affiliates.

  



  

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
honor the bonus plans or arrangements in place for Continuing Employees for
the Closing Fiscal Year. To the extent that the Closing occurs prior to the
payment of bonuses in respect of the 2017 Fiscal Year of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation will pay the annual bonuses to participating Company
Service Providers in respect of Fiscal Year 2017 in the ordinary course and
based upon actual results for Fiscal Year 2017, but not less than the Pro
Rata Bonus Amount applicable for each such Continuing Employee, in each case
subject to such Continuing Employee's continued employment with the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries through the bonus payment date. To the
extent that the Closing occurs prior to the establishment of bonus
opportunities for Fiscal Year 2018, each Continuing Employee will be
granted an annual bonus opportunity for the Closing Fiscal Year that is no
less favorable than the annual bonus opportunity such Continuing Employee
enjoyed under the bonus plans or arrangements for the Company's immediately
preceding fiscal year.

  



  

(d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and any of its respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
third-party insurance providers or third-party administrators to, use
reasonable best efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to any pre-existing
condition, limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods in its applicable health and welfare plans with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to each
Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) under any health and
welfare plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time and (ii) credit

  



    

55

 

    

each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) for any
copayments, deductibles, offsets or similar payments made under any
employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during the
plan year (which includes the Acceptance Time) for purposes of satisfying any
applicable copayment, deductible, offset or similar requirements under the
comparable plans of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(e) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and any of its and their respective Subsidiaries to, give
Continuing Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility to participate
and vesting, but not benefit accruals, under any employee benefit plans or
arrangements maintained by Parent, Merger Sub or an applicable Subsidiary
(other than any retiree medical plans) that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time for such Continuing
Employees' service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as
service with any predecessor employer), to the same extent that such service
was credited for purposes of any comparable Company Plan immediately prior to
the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that it would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of
service.

  



  

(f) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to assume and honor, in accordance with its terms,
each Company Plan set forth on Section 8.04(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and all obligations thereunder, including any rights or benefits
arising as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or
in combination with any other event, including termination of employment).

  



  

(g) Without limiting the generality of Section 12.06, the provisions of
this Section 8.04 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, and no current or former Company Service Provider or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Section 8.04. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
establish, amend or modify any Company Plan or any other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or prevent
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates from
(A) amending or terminating any particular benefit plan in accordance with its
terms or (B) terminating the employment of any particular Company Service
Provider.

  



  

Section 8.05. _Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided in Section
3.03(c), all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other such similar Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to the Merger shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub when due.

  



  

Section 8.06. _Financing_. (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on terms and conditions
consistent with the Debt Commitment Letters. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Debt Commitment Letters in accordance with and

  



    

56

 

    

subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, (ii) satisfy on a
timely basis (or obtain the waiver of) all conditions within its control to
obtaining the Debt Financing on terms and conditions consistent with those
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on terms and
conditions consistent with those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters or
on other terms and conditions acceptable to Parent which would not (x) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing when the Equity Financing is
increased by a corresponding amount or (y) impose new or additional
conditions precedent to the receipt of the Debt Financing, in the case of
this clause (y) that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the
Closing.

  



  

(b) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision
(including any remedy) under, or voluntarily replace (it being understood
that any Alternate Financing shall not be deemed a voluntary replacement for
purposes of the sentence), the Commitment Letters if such amendment,
modification, waiver or voluntary replacement (i) adds new (or adversely
modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing
or Equity Financing as compared to those in the Commitment Letters as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii) adversely affects the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letters
as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the
ability of Parent to enforce its rights against such other parties to the
Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof, (iii) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Financing less than the Required Amount, or (iv)
would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, no consent from the
Company shall be required for: (A) any amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification of a Debt Commitment Letter that is limited to adding lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have
not executed such Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement
(including in replacement of a lender), (B) implementation or exercise of any
"flex" provisions in effect as of the date hereof or (C) any amendment,
replacement, supplement or modification to the Commitment Letters so long as
such action would not be prohibited by the foregoing clauses (i)-(iv).

  



  

(c) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice of (i) any
default or breach (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any default or breach)
by any party under any of the Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (ii)
any termination of any of the Commitment Letters, (iii) the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication from any Financing Source with
respect to any (A) actual or potential default, breach, termination or
repudiation of any Commitment Letter, any definitive agreement relating to
the Financing or any provision of the Commitment Letters or the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing, in each case by any party thereto, or
(B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Commitment Letters or the definitive

  



    

57

 

    

agreements relating to the obligation to fund the Financing (but excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with respect to
the Financing or definitive agreements related to the Financing), and (iv) if
for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it will not
be able obtain Financing in an amount equal to the Required Amount, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment Letters or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing, as the case may be. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the date the Company delivers to Parent or
Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the immediately preceding
sentence.

  



  

(d) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (including the flex
provisions), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event,
alternative debt financing ("Alternate Financing") on terms that are no less
favorable (including after giving effect to the flex provisions) to Parent,
the Company and Merger Sub in any respect, in an amount, taken together with
the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing and other funds available to
Parent at Closing, to enable Parent and Merger Sub to pay the Required
Amount. In the event any binding commitment letter, it being understood
that Parent shall have no obligation to accept terms that are less favorable
in any respect to Parent than those included in the Debt Commitment Letters
(each such letter, a "New Debt Commitment Letter") is obtained with respect to
an Alternate Financing, Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy
of such New Debt Commitment Letter. Any reference in this Agreement to the
"Debt Commitment Letters" herein shall be deemed to include any Debt
Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment
Letter at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letter to the
extent then in effect and any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt
Financing" herein shall be deemed to include any Alternate Financing
contemplate by a New Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

Section 8.07. _Financing Cooperation._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, use
its and their reasonable best efforts to provide such cooperation as may be

 _provided_ that until the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) have no
liability or any obligation under any agreement or document related to the
Financing and (ii) not be required to incur any other liability in connection
with the Financing unless simultaneously reimbursed or
reasonably satisfactorily indemnified by Parent.

approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental Authority that
are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the

entry into other commitments and limitations, and litigation, including with
Governmental Authorities, as may be necessary to obtain any antitrust or
competition approvals or clearances from any Governmental Authority required
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (any such action, an
"Antitrust Action"); provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, nothing in this Section 9.01 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to
take any action (including any Antitrust Action) that would reasonably be
expected to result in or account for, either individually or in the
aggregate, an annual loss of net worldwide sales revenues (as measured by 2016
sales revenue) in excess of $85 million to Parent and any of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries), taken as a whole (any such action described in this proviso, a
"Burdensome Condition"). The Company shall not (and shall not cause any
Subsidiary to), without Parent's prior written consent, take or commit to take
any action (including any Antitrust Action) that (x) limits Parent's freedom
of action with respect to its business or Parent's ability to obtain or enjoy
the rights or benefits of the Surviving Corporation's or the Subsidiaries'
business or (y) would constitute or reasonably be expected to result in any
Burdensome Condition. In furtherance of this Section 9.01, at
Parent's request, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain all
approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations required to be obtained from any Third Party (including under
any Material Contracts) that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that the Company
shall not, without Parent's prior consent subject to applicable laws, agree
to make any payments or accept any material condition or obligation to any
contract to which the Company is a party. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Equity Investors and their respective
Affiliates (including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co. L.P. ("KKR") and any
investment funds or investment vehicles affiliated with, or managed or

in the private equity industry) or investment of KKR or of any such investment
fund or investment vehicle), other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, shall
have no obligation, and Parent shall have no obligation to cause the Equity
Investors or any such Affiliates to agree to or otherwise effect any
divestiture, hold separate arrangement, change to its assets or
business, litigation or any other Antitrust Action. Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall not be required to (and without Parent's consent, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not) take any action (including any
Antitrust Action) in order to obtain any approval or clearance from any
Governmental Authority which is not conditioned upon the consummation of the
Closing.

  



  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent
and the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the "Antitrust
Division") as promptly as practicable and in any event within 10 Business Days
after the date hereof (and such filings shall request early termination of
any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act), and subject to

  



    

61

 

    

Applicable Law, furnish to the other party as promptly as reasonably
practicable all information required for any application or other filing to
be made by the other party pursuant to any Applicable Law in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and the
Company shall (i) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any
inquiries received from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, or any other
Governmental Authority in connection with antitrust matters, and (ii) not
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with
the FTC or the Antitrust Division not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to ensure that Parent and its Subsidiaries not take any action if such action
would be reasonably expected to result in any material impediment or material
delay in obtaining applicable clearances required under the HSR Act. At the
request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services, or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (but, absent such request,
the Company shall not take any such action), provided that any such action
shall be conditioned upon the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Each party shall (1) promptly notify the other parties of any
substantive communication to that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division,
any State Attorney General or any other Governmental Authority and, subject
to Applicable Law, permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed
written communication to any of the foregoing; (2) not agree to participate
in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning any competition

Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat; and (3) furnish, subject to Applicable Law, the other parties with
copies of all correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between them and their affiliates and
their respective representatives on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or members or their respective staffs on the other
hand, with respect to any competition or antitrust matters in connection with
this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with
respect to the matters covered in this Section 9.01, it is agreed that Parent
shall make all strategic decisions and lead all discussions, negotiations and
other proceedings, and coordinate all activities with respect to any requests
that may be made by, or any actions, consents, undertakings, approvals, or
waivers that may be sought by or from, any Governmental Entity, including
determining the strategy for contesting, litigating or otherwise responding
to objections to, or proceedings challenging, the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case
subject to good faith consultations with the Company reasonably in advance and
in consideration of the Company's views and subject to the provisions of
Section 9.01(b). The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Representatives to, make any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or
otherwise engage in negotiations or discussions with any Governmental Entity
with respect to any proposed settlement, consent decree,

  



    

62

 

    

commitment or remedy or, in the event of litigation, discovery, admissibility
of evidence, timing or scheduling, except as specifically requested by or
agreed with Parent.

  



  

Section 9.02. _Certain Filings_ The Company and Parent shall cooperate with
one another (a) in connection with the preparation of the Company
Disclosure Documents, (b) in determining whether any action by or in respect
of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions,
consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any
Materials Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (c) in taking such actions or making any
such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith or with
the Company Disclosure Documents and seeking timely to obtain any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

  



  

Section 9.03. _Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the
Company shall, with the assistance of Parent, prepare, and the Company shall,
no later than 15 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, file with the
SEC, a proxy statement relating to the adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the
"Proxy Statement"). Parent and the Company shall cooperate with one another
in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement and Parent shall
have the right to review and to propose comments to the Proxy Statement (and
the Company shall in good faith consider such comments reasonably proposed by
Parent for inclusion therein). Parent shall furnish all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub as the Company may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Parent and the
Company shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy
Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after such
filing. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC (but
not later than five Business Days after such clearance).

  



  

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable notify the other of (i) the receipt of any comments from the SEC
and all other written correspondence and oral communications with the SEC
relating to the Proxy Statement and (ii) any request by the SEC for any
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or for additional information
with respect thereto. All filings by the Company with the SEC and all
mailings to the stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Proxy Statement
and any amendment or supplement thereto, shall be subject to the reasonable
prior review and comment of Parent.

  



  

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating
to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that the Proxy Statement

  



    

63

 

    

would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

  



  

(d) The Company shall, in accordance with its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and Applicable Law, promptly following the date of
this Agreement, for the purposes of obtaining the Stockholder Approval, duly
set a record date and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly

cleared by the SEC (with the record date and meeting date to be set by the
Board in consultation with Parent regarding such dates), a meeting of the
stockholders of the Company (the "Stockholder Meeting") for the purpose of
seeking the Stockholder Approval. The Company may postpone, recess or adjourn
the Stockholder Meeting (i) for one time only not to exceed ten (10)

reasonably believes that it will be unable to obtain a quorum of its
stockholders at the Stockholder Meeting or it will not receive proxies
sufficient to obtain the Stockholder Approval or (ii) to allow up to ten (10)
calendar days of additional time (commencing, if there has occurred any
Adverse Recommendation Change, on the date of such Adverse Recommendation
Change has been made (for the avoidance of doubt, after the expiration of any
time periods contemplated in the definition thereof)) for the filing and

Board has determined in good faith is necessary under Applicable Law.

with each other before issuing any press release, having any communication
with the press (whether or not for attribution) or making any other public
statement, or scheduling any press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except in respect of any public statement or press
release as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or
rule of any national securities exchange or association, shall not issue any
such press release or make any such other public statement or schedule any
such press conference or conference call before such consultation _provided_
, _however_ that Parent shall be permitted to make public announcements
opposing any Acquisition Proposal or Adverse Recommendation Change that has
been publicly disclosed.

Shares in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including derivative securities of such Shares) by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with
respect to the Company and will become subject to such reporting requirements
with respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the 1934 Act.

  



  

Section 9.07. _Notices of Certain Events._ Each of the Company and Parent
shall promptly notify the other of:

  



  

(a) any written notice or other written communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(b) any written notice or other written communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by

of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that relate to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

thereafter.

contemplated by this Agreement; provided that the Company shall give Parent
reasonable opportunity to participate, at

  



    

65

 

    

Parent's expense, in such litigation or other legal proceedings; and
provided, further, that the Company agrees that it shall not settle any such
litigation or other legal proceedings without the prior written consent of
Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; provided, however, that Parent shall not be obligated to consent
to any settlement that does not include a full release of Parent and its
Affiliates or that imposes an equitable remedy upon Parent or its Affiliates
including, after the Effective Time, the Company. For the avoidance of doubt,
any matters related to Dissenting Shares shall be governed exclusively by
Section 3.04 and not this Section 9.09, and any matters related to antitrust
or competition clearances or approvals, or any litigation or
proceeding pursuant to any antitrust or competition law, shall be governed
exclusively by Section 9.01 and not this Section 9.09.

Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and the respective
members of their boards of directors shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, use reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and to
take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise to take all such
other actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects
of any such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

Parent for inclusion therein).

Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the agent under the credit
agreement by and among the Company, the lenders named therein, Bank of

payoff letter (the "Payoff Letter") with respect to the Credit Agreement, in
customary form, which Payoff Letter shall acknowledge (1) the aggregate
principal amount and all accrued but unpaid interest constituting the
payoff amount (the "Payoff Amount"), (2) that upon receipt of the relevant
Payoff Amount, the Credit Agreement and related instruments evidencing the

been satisfied, in the case of Section 10.01(c), as a result of any injunction
or other order by a Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction in
connection with the HSR Act or any other applicable competition or antitrust
law, and including, without limitation, and in the case of Sections 10.01(b)
and 10.01(c), as a result of Parent not agreeing to take an Antitrust Action
that would constitute a Burdensome Condition, (y) as of the End Date, all of
the other conditions set forth in Section 10.01 and Section 10.02 have been

been satisfied, neither the failure of the condition set forth in Section
10.01(b) to be satisfied nor an injunction or other order by a Governmental
Authority having competent jurisdiction in connection with the HSR Act or any
other applicable competition or antitrust law having occurred and that caused
the failure of the condition set forth in Section 10.01(c) to be satisfied, in
each case in and of itself, shall constitute a "Company Material Adverse
Effect"), and (z) the Company is not in material breach of its obligations
under this Agreement;

  



  

then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company in immediately
available funds the Parent Termination Fee, within two Business Days after
such termination; _provided_ that, solely with respect to a termination of
this Agreement in the circumstances described in clause (A) or (C) above, if

Willful Breach of the Support Agreement, (ii) the Company shall have provided
written notice to Parent and/or such Equity Investor, as applicable, regarding
such Willful Breach and (iii) following the delivery of such notice, such
Willful Breach (if curable) was not cured by Parent, Merger Sub and/or such
Equity Investor(s), as applicable, within 30 days of receipt of such notice
(or, if earlier, by the End Date) and this Agreement is then terminated in
the circumstances described in clause (A) or (C) above, then Parent shall pay
or cause to be paid to the Company in immediately available funds the Willful
Breach Antitrust Termination Fee, within two Business Days after such
termination. For purposes hereof, (A) "Parent Termination Fee" means $56.6
Million and (B) "Willful Breach Antitrust Termination Fee" means $113.3
Million. For the avoidance of doubt, and not withstanding anything to the
contrary, the Willful Breach Antitrust Termination Fee may only be available
to the Company, subject to the above terms and conditions, in connection with
a Willful Breach by Parent or Merger Sub of _Section 9.01_ (to the extent
related to or in connection with obligations thereunder to obtain antitrust
or competition approvals or clearances from any Governmental Authority) or by
either (or both) of the Equity Investors of the Support Agreement, and in no
other instance.

  



    

74

 

    

(c) Parent and Merger Sub agree that, upon any termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is payable by
the Company pursuant to this Section and such Company Termination Fee is paid
in full, Parent and Merger Sub shall be precluded from any other remedy
against the Company, at law or in equity or otherwise, and neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any
kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the
Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, stockholders or
Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(d) The parties agree that the Company Termination Fee, the Parent
Termination Fee and the Willful Breach Antitrust Termination Fee are
liquidated damages and not penalties, and the payment of the Company
Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the Willful Breach Antitrust
Termination Fee, as applicable, in the circumstances specified herein is
supported by due and sufficient consideration. Accordingly, if the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay the Company Termination Fee,
Parent Termination Fee or the Willful Breach Antitrust Termination Fee, as
applicable, due pursuant to this Section 12.04 and, in order to obtain such
payment, either Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences a suit
against the other party that results in a judgment for the payment of the
Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the Willful Breach
Antitrust Termination Fee, as applicable, the party paying such fee shall
also pay to the other party interest on such fee at the annual rate equal to
the prime rate, as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made, through the date such payment was
actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law ("Interest Expense"). The parties agree and understand that in
no event shall Parent be required to pay both the Parent Termination Fee and
the Willful Breach Antitrust Termination, it being understood and agreed that
only one payment of either the Parent Termination Fee or the Willful Breach
Antitrust Termination Fee shall ever be payable hereunder.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the
Company terminates this Agreement, the Company's right to receive the payment
of either the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 12.04(b)(iii), if
any, or the payment of the Willful Breach Antitrust Termination Fee pursuant
to Section 12.04(b)(iii), if any, shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy (whether such remedy is sought in equity or at law, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) of the Company, the stockholders of the Company and their
respective Affiliates against Parent, the Equity Investors, the Financing
Sources, and any of their respective former, current and future holders of
any equity, partnership or limited liability company interest, controlling
Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, affiliated (or
commonly advised) funds, representatives (including attorneys),
members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders, or assignees
(each, a "Non-Recourse Party"), and any of their respective Non-Recourse
Parties (collectively, the "Parent Related Parties") for any loss, damage
or other liability of any kind suffered as a result of any breach (including
any Willful Breach) of any

  



    

75

 

    

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of this Agreement, the
Support Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the Limited Guarantees or the
failure of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Support
Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the Limited Guarantees to be
consummated, in each case, in any circumstance in which the Company is
permitted to terminate this Agreement and receive the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 12.04(b)(iii) or the payment of the Willful Breach
Antitrust Termination Fee pursuant to Section 12.04(b)(iii). If the Company
terminates this Agreement in a circumstance in which Parent is obligated to
pay to the Company either the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section
12.04(b)(iii) or the Willful Breach Antitrust Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 12.04(b)(iii), as applicable, upon payment of either the Parent
Termination Fee (and any Interest Expense) or the payment of the Willful
Breach Antitrust Termination Fee (and any Interest Expense), as applicable,
none of the Parent Related Parties and Lender Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Support Agreement, the Commitment Letters, the Limited
Guarantees or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Support
Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the Limited Guarantees (or the failure of
any such transactions to be consummated) or as a result of any loss, damage
or other liability of any kind suffered as a result of any breach (including
any Willful Breach) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
this Agreement, the Support Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the Limited
Guarantees, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective stockholders or Representatives may seek to recover any
other monetary damages from or seek any other remedy against any Parent
Related Party or any Lender Related Party based on a claim in law or equity
with respect to, any matter relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Support Agreement, the Commitment Letters, the Limited Guarantees or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Support Agreement, the
Commitment Letters or the Limited Guarantees (or the failure of any such
transactions to be consummated), including, without limitation, (i) any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, (ii) the
termination of this Agreement or (iii) any liabilities or obligations arising
under this Agreement, the Support Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the
Limited Guarantees or any loss, damage or other liability of any kind
suffered as a result of any breach (including any Willful Breach) of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of this Agreement, the Support
Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the Limited Guarantees, _provided_ ,
however that nothing herein shall limit the rights and remedies of the Company
and its Affiliates under the Confidentiality Agreements.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in any circumstance
in which the Company is not permitted to terminate this Agreement and receive
either the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 12.04(b)(iii) or the
Willful Breach Antitrust Termination Fee pursuant to Section 12.04(b)(iii),
as applicable, in no event shall the Company or the stockholders of the
Company and their respective Affiliates be entitled to monetary damages
(whether such damages are sought in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise), individually or in the aggregate, in excess of an amount equal to
the amount of the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, for any loss, damage
or other liability of any kind suffered as a result of any breach (including
any Willful Breach)

  



    

76

 

    

under this Agreement, the Support Agreement, the Commitment Letters, the
Limited Guarantees, or otherwise arising out of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Support Agreement, the
Commitment Letters or the Limited Guarantees (or the failure of any such
transactions to be consummated). In no event shall the Company or the
stockholders of the Company or their respective Affiliates seek to recover
monetary damages from any Parent Related Party (other than Parent under the
terms of this Agreement and the parties to the Confidentiality Agreements
under the terms thereof) or from any Lender Related Party. The Parent Related
Parties and the Lender Related Parties are intended third party beneficiaries
of this Section.

  



  

Section 12.05. _Disclosure Schedule._ The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Section of either the Company Disclosure Schedule
or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to
(or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and
warranties of the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding
Section of this Agreement and (b) any other representations and warranties of
the relevant party that are contained in this Agreement, (other than Section
5.10(a)), but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or
a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties is
reasonably apparent. The mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty (or covenant, as
applicable) shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

  



  

Section 12.06. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. (a) Subject to
Section 12.06(b), the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 8.03, no provision of
this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and other than the right
of any holders of Shares, Company Options and Vested Company Stock Units to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of their Shares, Company
Options and Vested Company Stock Units, as contemplated by Article 3.

  



  

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto; _provided_ , that, prior to the time that the Proxy Statement is
mailed to the Company's stockholders, Parent may designate, by written notice
to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary in lieu of
Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed
references to such other Subsidiary, except that all representations and
warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this
Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to
such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ , 
_further_ that any such assignment or designation shall not and would not be
reasonably expected to impede or delay the consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially
impair or impede the rights of the Company's

  



    

77

 

    

stockholders under this Agreement. Any purported assignment, delegation or
other transfer in violation of this Section 12.06(b) shall be void.

  



  

Section 12.07. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

  



  

Section 12.08. _Jurisdiction. _ (a) The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its
Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in
the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction,
any federal court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state
court, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process
in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on
such party as provided in Section 12.01 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of
the parties acknowledges and irrevocably agrees (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates): (i) that any claim, action or proceeding, whether at law or in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, involving any of the Lender
Related Parties arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or the Debt Financing or the performance of
services thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of New York
in the borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each of the
parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court with respect to
any such claim, action or proceeding; (ii) not to bring or permit any of
their affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such action,
claim or proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at their
respective addresses provided in the Debt Commitment Letter will be effective
service of process against them for any such action, claim or proceeding
brought in any such court; (iv) to waive and hereby does waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, any objection which any of them may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action, claim or
proceeding in any such court; (v) that any such action, claim or proceeding
will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
New York; and (vi) agrees that a final judgment in any such action shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law.

  



    

78

 

    

Section 12.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE DEBT FINANCING).

  



  

Section 12.10. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto
shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication).

  



  

Section 12.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreements constitute the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.12. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party; provided that, the parties intend that the
remedies and limitations thereon contained in Section 12.04 ( _Expenses_ ) be
construed as an integral provision of this Agreement and that such remedies
and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases a
party's liability or obligations hereunder or under the Commitment Letters or
the Limited Guarantee. Upon such a determination of severability pursuant to
the foregoing sentence, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  



  

Section 12.13. _Specific Performance_. (a) The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with its terms, and that monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, subject,
in the case of specific enforcement of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations
to consummate the Merger (and/or draw down the proceeds of the Equity
Financing) only, to Section 12.13(b), the parties hereto acknowledge and
hereby agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any
of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement or
the Commitment

  



    

79

 

    

Letters, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent or Merger Sub, on the other
hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or the Commitment
Letters by the other (as applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement or the Commitment Letters to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other (as applicable) under this Agreement or the
Commitment Letters, without proof of actual damages or inadequacy of legal
remedy and without bond or other security being required, and this right
shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent or Merger Sub to fully
enforce the terms of the Commitment Letters, including by requiring Parent
and Merger Sub to file one or more lawsuits against the Financing Sources to
fully enforce the Financing Sources' obligations under the Commitment
Letters. The pursuit of specific enforcement or other equitable remedies by
any party hereto will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the
right to pursue any other right or remedy (whether at law or in equity) to
which such party may be entitled at any time.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (1) in no event shall
the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parent's
and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the Merger if a Debt Financing
Failure has occurred and (2) the Company shall be entitled to enforce or seek
to enforce specifically Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate
the Merger (and/or draw down the proceeds of the Equity Financing) if and only
if (i) all conditions in Section 10.01 and Section 10.02 have been satisfied
(other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of those conditions at the Closing)
at the time the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 3.01(b),
(ii) the Debt Financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letters is
available for immediate drawdown in accordance with its terms if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in writing that if specific performance is granted, then the
Company will take such actions to ensure that Closing will occur. For the
avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and payment of the
Parent Termination Fee.

  



  

Section 12.14. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not
intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder; provided, however, that it is
specifically intended that (A) the Indemnified Persons (solely with respect
to Section 8.03), (B) the Lender Related Parties (solely with respect to
Section 12.04(e) and (f) ( _Expenses_ ), Section 12.08 ( _Jurisdiction_ ),
Section 12.09 ( _Waiver of Jury Trial_ ), Section 12.12 ( _Severability_ ),
this Section 12.14 ( _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_ ) and Section 12.15 ( _No
Recourse_ ) and (C) the Parent Related Parties (solely with respect to
Section 12.04(e) and (f) ( _Expenses_ ), Section 12.07 ( _Governing Law_ ),
Section 12.08 ( _Jurisdiction_ ), Section 12.09 ( _Waiver of Jury Trial_ ),
Section 12.12 ( _Severability_ ), this Section 12.14 ( _No Third-Party
Beneficiaries_ ) and Section 12.15 ( _No Recourse_ )) are third-party
beneficiaries of this relevant provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.15. _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against,
and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this

  



    

80

 

    

Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may
only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as parties
hereto and no Parent Related Party (other than the Equity Investors to the
extent set forth in their respective Limited Guarantee) or Lender Related
Party shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the
parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of the
Company against Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, in no event shall the Company
or any of its Affiliates, and the Company agrees not to and to cause its
Affiliates not to, seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for
breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from,
any Parent Related Party (other than any payment from each Equity Investor to
the extent set forth in their respective Limited Guarantee) or Lender Related
Party.

Exhibit A

  



  

Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation

  



  

AMENDED AND RESTATED

  



  

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 
  
 OF 
  
 PHARMERICA CORPORATION

  



  

FIRST: The name of the corporation (which is hereinafter referred to as the
"Corporation") is PharMerica Corporation.

  



  

SECOND: The registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is
located at 4001 Kennett Pike, Suite 302, County of New Castle, Wilmington, DE
19807, and the name of the registered agent of the Corporation whose office
address will be the same as the registered office is Maples Fiduciary
Services (Delaware) Inc.

  



  

THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), as from time
to time amended.

  



  

FOURTH: The total number of shares of capital stock which the Corporation
shall have authority to issue is 1,000, all of which shares shall be Common
Stock having a par value per share of $0.01.

  



  

FIFTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law,
subject to any limitations contained elsewhere in this certificate of
incorporation, bylaws of the Corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed
by a majority of the board of directors of the Corporation. Election of
directors need not be by written ballot.

  



  

SIXTH: No director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or
its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her fiduciary duty
as a director, except to the extent that such exemption from liability or
limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as currently in effect or
as the same may hereafter be amended. Any amendment, repeal or modification of
this ARTICLE SIXTH shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a
director of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission
occurring prior to the time of such amendment, repeal or modification. If the
DGCL is amended after the filing of this Certificate of Incorporation to
authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal
liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation
shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as
so amended.

  



  

SEVENTH: (a) The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law as
it presently exists and may hereafter be amended, indemnify any person who
was

  



    



 

    

or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit or proceeding (a "Proceeding"), whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that
he or she (or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative) is or
was a director or officer of the Corporation, or, while a director or officer
of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged
to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, and may indemnify any person
who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to such a Proceeding
by reason of the fact that he or she is or was an employee or agent of the
Corporation, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her
or on his or her behalf in connection with such Proceeding and any appeal
therefrom, if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; except that in the case of
a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in
its favor (1) such indemnification shall be limited to expenses (including
attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in the
defense or settlement of such Proceeding, and (2) no indemnification shall be
made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall
have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the
extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such
Proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case,
such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses
which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to paragraph (e) of this ARTICLE
SEVENTH, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify a director or
officer of the Corporation in respect of a Proceeding (or part thereof)
instituted by such director or officer, unless such Proceeding (or part
thereof) has been authorized in the specific case by the board of directors.
The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order settlement, conviction,
or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself,
create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a
manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
Proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was
unlawful.

  



  

(b) To the extent that a present or former director or officer of the
Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
Proceeding referred to in paragraph (a) of this ARTICLE SEVENTH or in defense
of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified
against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred
by such person in connection therewith.

  



  

(c) Any indemnification of a present or former director or officer of the
Corporation under paragraph (a) of this ARTICLE SEVENTH (unless ordered by
a court) shall be made by the Corporation unless a determination is made that
indemnification of the present or former director or officer is not proper in
the circumstances because he or

  



    

2

 

    

she has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraph (a)
of this ARTICLE SEVENTH. Any indemnification of a present or former employee
or agent of the Corporation under paragraph (a) of this ARTICLE SEVENTH
(unless ordered by a court) may be made by the Corporation upon a
determination that indemnification of the present or former employee or agent
is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in paragraph (a) of this ARTICLE SEVENTH. Any
such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director
or officer at the time of such determination, (1) by a majority vote of
the directors who are not parties to such Proceeding, even though less than a
quorum, or (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote
of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such
directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a
written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders.

  



  

(d) To the fullest extent not prohibited by law, expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred by a current or former director or officer in
defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative Proceeding
shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such
Proceeding; provided, however, that such advancement of expenses shall, to the
extent required by law, be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified
by the Corporation as authorized in this ARTICLE SEVENTH.

  



  

(e) Any indemnification of a director or officer of the Corporation under
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this ARTICLE SEVENTH, or advance of costs,
charges and expenses to a director or officer under paragraph (d) of this
ARTICLE SEVENTH, shall be made promptly, and in any event within thirty (30)
days, upon the written request of the director or officer. If a determination
by the Corporation that the director or officer is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE SEVENTH is required, and the
Corporation fails to respond within thirty (30) days to a written request for
indemnity, the Corporation shall be deemed to have approved such request. If
the Corporation denies a written request for indemnity or advancement of
expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request
is not made within thirty (30) days, the right to indemnification or advances
as granted by this ARTICLE SEVENTH shall be enforceable by the director or
officer in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such person's costs and
expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her
right to indemnification or advancement, in whole or in part, in any
such Proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a
defense to any such Proceeding (other than an action brought to enforce a
claim for the advance of costs, charges and expenses under paragraph (d) of
this ARTICLE SEVENTH where the required undertaking, if any, has been
received by the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of
conduct set forth in paragraph (a) of this ARTICLE SEVENTH, but the burden of
proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its board of directors, its independent legal counsel,
and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement
of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the
circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in paragraph (a) of this ARTICLE

SEVENTH, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its board of directors, its independent legal counsel,
and its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard
of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

  



  

(f) The foregoing indemnification provisions shall be deemed to be a contract
between the Corporation and each director, officer, employee and agent who
serves in any such capacity at any time while these provisions as well as the
relevant provisions of the DGCL are in effect and any repeal or modification
thereof shall not affect any right or obligation then existing with respect to
any state of facts then or previously existing or any Proceeding previously
or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such
state of facts. Such a "contract right" may not be modified retroactively
without the consent of such director, officer, employee or agent. The
indemnification provided by this ARTICLE SEVENTH shall not be deemed exclusive
of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any
bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as
to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such
a person.

  



  

(g) The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was or has agreed to become a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability
asserted against such person and incurred by such person or on such person's
behalf in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her
against such liability under the provisions of this ARTICLE SEVENTH.

  



  

(h) If this ARTICLE SEVENTH or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any
ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall
nevertheless indemnify each director or officer and may indemnify each
employee or agent of the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses
(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
with respect to a Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation,
to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this ARTICLE
SEVENTH that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.
