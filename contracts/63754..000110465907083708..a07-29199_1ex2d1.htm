### of transfer shall not require Seller to make any additional
representations, warranties or covenants, expressed or implied, not contained
in this Agreement); and

  

### 

  

### (b) Purchaser shall deliver to Seller and the Seller Affiliates (i)
payment, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated in writing by Seller (such designation to be made at
least one business day prior to the Closing Date), in an amount equal to (A)

### 

  

## SECTION 2.03. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment._  (a) _The
Statement_. Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Purchaser a statement (the " _Statement_ "), setting forth the
value of the Transferred Inventory (the " _Statement Inventory_ ") as of
11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date (" _Closing Inventory_ ") calculated net of
reserves in accordance with the principles set forth on Schedule 2.03 and
otherwise in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ "). Purchaser shall assist Seller and its independent
auditors and other representatives in the preparation of the Statement and
shall provide Seller and its independent auditors and other representatives
any information reasonably requested and shall provide them access at all
reasonable times to the personnel, properties, books and records of the
Business for such purpose. Purchaser and its agents shall be permitted to
observe any physical inventory taken to determine the Closing Inventory.

  

## 

  

### (b) _Objections; Resolution of Disputes._

  

### 

  

#### (i) Unless Purchaser notifies Seller in writing within 60 days after
SellerÂ’s delivery of the Statement of any objection to the computation
of Closing Inventory set forth therein (the " _Notice of Objection_ "),
the Statement shall become final and binding. During such 60-day period
Purchaser and its representatives shall be permitted to review the working
papers of Seller relating to the Statement and shall be granted reasonable
access to appropriate personnel of Seller responsible for preparing such
Statement. Any Notice of Objection shall specify in reasonable detail the
basis for the objections set forth therein and shall include a certification
by the Chief Financial Officer of Purchaser that such Notice of Objection has
been prepared in accordance with this Section 2.03. Any Notice of Objection
shall include only objections

  



        
   

  



  

#### based on (A) mathematical errors in the computation of Closing Inventory
or (B) Closing Inventory not having been calculated in accordance with
the principles set forth on Schedule 2.03. Seller and Purchaser
acknowledge that (x) the sole purpose of the determination of Closing
Inventory is to adjust the Closing Date Payment so as to reflect, based
solely on the operation of the Business, the amount, if any, by which the
book value of the Statement Inventory as of the close of business on the
Closing Date deviates from the Target Inventory and (y) such amount, if any,
can be determined only if the calculation is done using the same accounting
principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in the preparation of
the Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) If Purchaser provides the Notice of Objection to Seller within such
60-day period, Purchaser and Seller shall, during the 60-day period following
SellerÂ’s receipt of the Notice of Objection, attempt in good faith to resolve
PurchaserÂ’s objections. During such 60-day period, Seller and its independent
auditors and other representatives shall be permitted to review the working
papers of Purchaser relating to the Notice of Objection and the
basis therefor and shall be granted reasonable access to appropriate
personnel of Purchaser responsible for preparing such Notice of Objection. If
Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve all such objections within such
60-day period, the matters remaining in dispute that were properly included
in the Notice of Objection shall be submitted to KPMG LLP (or, if such firm
declines to act, to another nationally recognized public accounting firm
mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller in writing and, if Purchaser and
Seller are unable to so agree within 10 days after the end of such 60-day
period, then Purchaser and Seller shall each select such a firm and such
firms shall jointly select a third nationally recognized firm to resolve the
disputed matters (such selected firm being the " _Independent Expert_ ")).
The parties shall instruct the Independent Expert to render its reasoned
written decision as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 60
days after its selection. The resolution of disputed items by the Independent
Expert shall be final and binding, and the determination of the Independent
Expert shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-
appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne
equally by Purchaser and Seller. After the Statement shall have become final
and binding, Purchaser shall have no further right to make any claims against
Seller in respect of (i) any element of Closing Inventory that Purchaser
raised, or could have raised, in the Notice of Objection or (ii) any payment
made pursuant to Section 2.03(c).

  

#### 

  

### (c) _Adjustment Payment._ The Purchase Price shall be increased by the
amount by which Closing Inventory exceeds $12,000,000 (the " _Target
Inventory_ "), and the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount by
which Closing Inventory is less than the Target Inventory (the Purchase Price
as so increased or decreased being hereinafter called the "
_Adjusted Purchase Price_ "). Within 10 days after the Statement has

  



        
   

  



  

### become final and binding in accordance with Section 2.03(b), (i) if the
Closing Date Payment is less than the Adjusted Purchase Price, Purchaser
shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such difference, plus simple interest
thereon at a rate of 5% per annum from the Closing Date to the date payment
is made in full, and (ii) if the Closing Date Payment is greater than the
Adjusted Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to
such difference, plus simple interest thereon at a rate of 5% per annum from
the Closing Date to the date payment is made in full (the Closing Date
Payment as so increased or decreased being hereinafter called the " _Final
Purchase Price_ "). Any such payment hereunder shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Closing Books and Records._ Except for the consummation of the
Closing, Purchaser and Seller agree that on the Closing Date itself the
Business shall be conducted in the ordinary course in a manner substantially
consistent with past practice.

by such Seller Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement constitutes a "United
States real property interest" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(l) of the
Code.

  

###

action which action or failure to act would violate Section 5.01 if such
action or failure to act were to occur after the date hereof. Purchaser
acknowledges that there may be disruption to the operation of the Business as
a result of the execution of this Agreement and any announcement thereof
(including the identity of Purchaser) and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and Purchaser agrees that any
such disruptions do not and shall not constitute a breach of this Section
3.11.

compliance in all material respects with all Applicable Laws. This Section

## SECTION 4.03. _No Conflicts or Violations; No Consents or Approvals
Required._ Except as set forth in Schedule 4.03, the execution and delivery

Purchaser of each Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is specified to be,

provision of (i) the organizational documents of Purchaser or any of its
subsidiaries, (ii) any Contract to which Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries

### (b) As of the Closing and immediately after consummating the Acquisition
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser will not
(i) be insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum
of its debts is greater than the fair value of its assets or because the
present fair salable value of its assets will be less than the amount
required to pay its probable liability on its debts as they become absolute
and matured), (ii) have unreasonably small capital with which to engage in
its business, including the Business, or (iii) have incurred or plan to incur
debts beyond its ability to repay such debts as they become absolute and

 _Covenants_

  



  

## SECTION 5.01. _Covenants Relating to Conduct of the Business._ (a)
Except for matters (x) set forth in Schedule 5.01, (y) expressly agreed to
by Purchaser or (z) expressly contemplated by the terms of this Agreement,
from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall
cause the Seller Affiliates to, conduct the Business in all material respects
in the ordinary course in a manner substantially consistent with
past practice and, to the extent consistent therewith, use commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve the material business relationships with
customers, suppliers, distributors and others with whom Seller and the Seller
Affiliates deal in connection with the conduct of the Business in the
ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that relationships with Seller and certain of its
affiliates providing services to the Business will terminate as of the
Closing as contemplated in Section 10.03 and that such termination shall not
constitute a breach of this Agreement. In addition, except as set forth in
Schedule 5.01 or as otherwise contemplated by the terms of this Agreement,
Seller shall not, and shall cause the Seller Affiliates not to, do any of the
following in connection with the Business without the prior written consent
of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law:

  

## 

  

#### (i) subject any of the Transferred Assets to any Lien of any
nature whatsoever that would have been required to be set forth in Schedule
3.05 if existing on the date of this Agreement;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) waive any Claims or rights of material value that
relate exclusively to the Business;

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of any Transferred Asset
that is material to the Business, except (A) Inventory and obsolete or excess
Equipment sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business, (B) any
Excluded Asset described in Section 1.02(b) and (C) leases entered into in
the ordinary course of business with aggregate annual lease payments not in
excess of $100,000;

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) fail to maintain any Transferred Trademarks or fail to maintain
in any material respect any Other Transferred Intellectual Property or
any Transferred Technology (in either case other than in the ordinary course
of business in a manner substantially consistent with past practice) or grant
to any person a license in respect of any Transferred Intellectual Property
or Transferred Technology;

  

#### 

  

#### (v) other than in the ordinary course of business in a
manner substantially consistent with past practice, fail to pay or otherwise
satisfy (except if being contested in good faith) any material accounts
payable, liabilities or obligations of the Business when due and payable;

  



        
   

  



  

#### (vi) enter into any new Contract that would be required to be listed
on Schedule 3.07(a) if it were in effect on the date of this Agreement; or

  

#### 

  

#### (vii) agree, whether in writing or otherwise, to do any of
the foregoing.

  

#### 

  

### (b) Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep, or to cause to
be kept, all insurance policies currently maintained with respect to the
Transferred Assets (the " _Seller Insurance Policies_ "), or suitable
replacements therefor, in full force and effect through 11:59 p.m. on the
Closing Date; it being understood that any and all Seller Insurance Policies
are owned and maintained by Seller and its affiliates (and do not exclusively
relate to the Business). Purchaser will not have any rights under the Seller
Insurance Policies from and after the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information._ Seller shall, and shall cause the
Seller Affiliates to, afford to Purchaser and its accountants, counsel and
other representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable prior notice during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Closing, to (i)
personnel engaged primarily in the conduct of the Business and (ii)
properties, books, Contracts, commitments and records relating exclusively to
the Business (other than the Excluded Assets), including unaudited Statements
of Net Sales and Profit Before Indirects; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in
each case such access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of
Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates or the Business. Nothing contained in
this Section 5.02 shall obligate Seller or any of its affiliates to breach
any duty of confidentiality owed to any person whether such duty arises
contractually, statutorily or otherwise.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 5.03. _Confidentiality._ (a) Purchaser acknowledges that
the information being provided to it in connection with the Acquisition and
the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby is subject to
the terms of a confidentiality agreement between Purchaser and Seller (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein
by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information
relating solely to the Business (other than the Excluded Assets and the
personnel engaged in the conduct of the Business); _provided_ , _however_
, that Purchaser acknowledges that any and all other information provided to
it by Seller or SellerÂ’s representatives concerning Seller and its
affiliates shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing Date.

  

## 

  

### (b) From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its
affiliates to, treat as confidential any proprietary or other confidential
information that is a Transferred Asset in a manner substantially consistent
with the manner in which Seller maintains the confidentiality of its own
proprietary or other confidential information as of the date of this
Agreement.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 5.04. _Reasonable Best Efforts._ (a) On the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement (including Section 5.04(c) hereof), each of
Seller and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Closing to occur, including taking all actions necessary to comply promptly
with all legal requirements that may be

  



        
   

  



  

## imposed on it or any of its affiliates with respect to the Closing. Each
of Seller and Purchaser shall not, and shall cause their respective
affiliates not to, take any actions that would, or that could reasonably be
expected to, result in any of the conditions set forth in Article VI not
being satisfied.

  

## 

  

### (b) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall as promptly as practicable, and,
in the case of their initial notification and report form required pursuant
to the HSR Act, in no event later than 30 calendar days following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, (i) file or cause to be filed with
the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United
States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form
required for the transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental
information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act and
(ii) make such other filings as are necessary in other jurisdictions in order
to comply with all Applicable Laws relating to competition and shall promptly
provide any supplemental information requested by applicable Governmental
Entities relating thereto. Any such filing, notification and report form and
supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act or such other Applicable Law. Each of Seller and
Purchaser shall furnish in confidence to the other such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act
or such other Applicable Law. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall keep each
other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other
applicable Governmental Entity and shall comply promptly with any such
inquiry or request and shall promptly provide any supplemental information
requested in connection with the filings made hereunder pursuant to the HSR
Act or such other Applicable Law. Any such supplemental information shall be
in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or such other
Applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (c) Without limitation of the covenants set forth in Sections 5.04 (a)
and 5.04(b), each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
clearance required under the HSR Act (" _HSR Clearance_ ") or other
Applicable Law for the consummation of the Acquisition. For purposes of this
Section 5.04(c), the obligation of the Purchaser to use "reasonable best
efforts" to obtain HSR Clearance or any clearance required under any
other Applicable Law for the consummation of the Acquisition shall include
its commitment to divest its Season-AllÂ® brand business (the " _Season-All Â®
Business_") on the basis set forth in Schedule 5.04(c) if necessary to obtain
HSR Clearance; _provided_ ,  _however_ , the parties agree that (i) such
commitment of Purchaser to divest the Season-AllÂ® Business is contingent on
obtaining HSR Clearance and successfully Closing the Acquisition; and (ii)
Purchaser shall not be required to divest any assets other than its Season-
AllÂ® Business in connection with satisfying its obligation to use reasonable
best efforts to obtain HSR Clearance or clearance under any other Applicable
Law for the consummation of the Acquisition.

  

### 

  

### (d) In the event that the parties receive a second information request in
response to the HSR Act filing (the " _Second Request_ "), the parties will
use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such Second
Request as promptly as

  



        
   

  



  

### possible and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate with each
other during the entire Second Request review process. If, notwithstanding
the reasonable best efforts of the parties to obtain HSR Clearance by July
31, 2008 (the " _Initial HSR Clearance Date_ ") (including the commitment by
Purchaser to divest the Season-AllÂ® Business on the terms set forth
in Section 5.04(c)), the parties have not obtained HSR Clearance by July 11,
2008, then, provided that the Extension Conditions (as hereinafter defined)
are satisfied, either Purchaser or Seller (in such capacity, the "
_Requesting Party_ "), may in good faith provide a written notice (the " _HSR
Extension Request_ ") to the other party (such other party, in such capacity,
the " _Non-Requesting Party_ ") requesting that such Non-Requesting Party
consent to an extension of the Initial HSR Clearance Date until October 31,
2008 (the " _Extended HSR Clearance Date_ "), which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed by the Non-Requesting Party. If the Non-
Requesting Party has not provided the Requesting Party written notice that it
has consented to the HSR Extension Request within four business days
following its receipt of the HSR Extension Request, the Requesting Party may
provide written notice to the Non-Requesting Party no later than July 18,
2008 (the " _HSR Meeting Request_ ") requesting that the Chairman and/or
Chief Executive Officer of Purchaser and the President of the Americas of
Seller discuss the HSR Extension Request (a " _Senior Officer Meeting_ ").
Such Senior Officer Meeting shall occur not more than five business days
following the date of the HSR Meeting Request. The Non-Requesting Party shall
notify the Requesting Party not more than three business days following the
Senior Officer Meeting whether it has consented to the HSR Extension Request
(the " _HSR Consent Determination Notice_ "). As used herein, the "
_Extension Conditions_ " are that all conditions to the Requesting PartyÂ’s
obligation to close the Acquisition as set forth in Section 6.01(a) (other
than obtaining HSR Clearance) and (x) in the event Seller is the Requesting
Party, Section 6.02 of this Agreement (other than with respect to
representations, warranties and covenants that would be materially true and
correct upon HSR Clearance being obtained) and (y) in the event Purchaser is
the Requesting Party, Section 6.03 of this Agreement (other than with respect
to representations, warranties and covenants that would be materially true
and correct upon HSR Clearance being obtained), respectively, have been
satisfied.

  

### 

  

### (e) Until the later to occur of (x) the Initial HSR Clearance Date and
(y) if the Non-Requesting Party consents to the HSR Extension Request, the
close of business on the Extended HSR Clearance Date, the parties will
continue to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain HSR
Clearance. If (i) prior to obtaining the HSR Clearance, the Non-Requesting
Party notifies the Requesting Party in a HSR Consent Determination Notice
that it does not consent to the HSR Extension Request or (ii) the Non-
Requesting Party consents to a HSR Extension Request but HSR Clearance is not
obtained prior to the close of business on the Extended HSR Clearance Date,
then either party may, upon written notice to the other party, terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01(a)(v) hereof. If either party
terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01(a)(v) hereof,
Purchaser shall, provided the Termination Fee Conditions (as hereinafter
defined) are satisfied, pay to Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, within five business days following the date of such
termination (the " _Termination Fee Payment Date_ "), a termination fee in
the amount of thirty million dollars ($30,000,000) (the " _Termination Fee_
"); so long as the Extension Conditions

  



        
   

  



  

### remain satisfied, such payment to be in full and final settlement of any
and all obligations that may be owed by Purchaser to Seller arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, including the
termination thereof. As used herein, the " _Termination Fee Conditions_ " are
that all conditions to PurchaserÂ’s obligation to close the Acquisition as set
forth in Section 6.01(a) (other than obtaining HSR Clearance) and Section
6.02 of this Agreement (other than with respect to representations,
warranties and covenants that would be materially true and correct upon HSR
Clearance being obtained) have been satisfied. No Termination Fee shall be
payable to Seller by Purchaser unless and until the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01(a)(v) hereof and under no other
circumstances. Interest shall accrue on any portion of the Termination Fee
not paid on or prior to the Termination Fee Payment Date at an annual rate of
12.0% from and after the day immediately following the Termination
Fee Payment Date to and including the date on which Seller shall have
received full payment of the Termination Fee.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 5.05. _Brokers or Finders._ Each of Purchaser and
Seller represents, as to itself and its affiliates, that no agent, broker,
investment banker or other firm or person is or will be entitled to any
brokerÂ’s or finderÂ’s fee or any other commission or similar fee in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except (a) as to
Seller and its affiliates, Lehman Brothers, whose fees and expenses will be
paid by Seller and (b) as to Purchaser and its affiliates, Goldman Sachs,
whose fees and expenses will be paid by Purchaser.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 5.06. _Non-Competition._

  

## 

  

### (a) Except as provided in Section 5.06(b), from the Closing Date until
the third anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller agrees, for itself and for
its affiliates, not to, directly or indirectly manufacture, market,
distribute or sell (x) seasoned salt, dry spice blends, meat tenderizers and
marinades (other than any product labeled and marketed as a salad dressing
that may be used as a marinade) of the type that the Business sells as of the
Closing Date through retail channels (including club stores and "cash and
carry" stores) to end-users located in the Territory (as defined below) or
(y) branded seasoned salt, branded dry spice blends or meat tenderizers of
the type that the Business sells as of the Closing Date through foodservice
channels to customers located in the Territory (each of the activities
described in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), a " _Competing Activity_ ");
_provided_ , that Seller and its affiliates may collectively own or acquire,
directly or indirectly, (i) securities of a corporation or other entity which
engages in any Competing Activity if they do not, directly or indirectly, own
more than 10% of the aggregate outstanding equity securities of such
corporation or entity, (ii) solely as a passive investment without voting
rights to elect directors of the issuer, any instrument of indebtedness (that
is not convertible or exchangeable for equity securities, except as may be
permitted by clause (i) above) of any entity engaged in any Competing
Activity and (iii) securities or other ownership interests of any entity
engaged in any Competing Activity within the Territory if such Competing
Activity within the Territory accounts for less than 10% of such entityÂ’s
consolidated annual revenues or assets. For purposes of this section, "
_Territory_ " shall mean the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. For the
avoidance of doubt, any product of Seller or its affiliates manufactured,
marketed,

  



        
   

  



  

### distributed or sold in the Territory primarily as a product of the type
described in clauses (x) or (y) of Section 5.06(a) shall be subject to
Section 5.06(a).

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.06(a) to the contrary, Seller,
the Seller Affiliates and their respective subsidiaries shall not be
prevented from (i) engaging in the business of manufacturing, marketing,
distributing and selling seasoning blends, gravies, gravy mixes and sauces,
(ii) engaging in, conducting or having an ownership interest in any business
that supplies goods or services primarily to Seller and its affiliates, so
long as such businessÂ’s supply of goods or services to entities other than
Seller and its affiliates does not violate the terms of Section 5.06(a),
(iii) engaging in the business of manufacturing, marketing, distributing and
selling any marinades packaged in per-unit sizes of at least one-half gallon
to club stores and "cash and carry" stores, (iv) manufacturing any product
within the Territory so long as such product is ultimately sold in a manner
that does not violate the restrictions on sale contained in Section 5.06(a),
(v) selling Products of the Canadian Marinades Business on behalf of
Purchaser as provided in Section 5.09(b), and (vi) treating the provisions of
Section 5.06(a) as having terminated at the time and to the extent none of
Purchaser and its subsidiaries continues to conduct in any material respect
any aspect of the Business.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 5.07. _Exclusivity._  From the date hereof through the earlier of
(x) the Closing Date and (y) the termination of the Agreement in accordance
with Section 7.01, the Seller shall not, and shall cause its affiliates and
agents not to, directly or indirectly solicit or engage in any discussions
with any person, firm, entity or group concerning any sale, in whole or in
part, of the Business or the Transferred Assets or of any merger or other
business combination involving the Business or the Transferred Assets (other
than (i) sales of Inventory in the ordinary course of business and (ii) as
otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement).

  

## 

  

## SECTION 5.08. _Financial Statement Delivery._ (a) If requested by
Purchaser, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing,
Seller shall prepare, and Seller shall request that SellerÂ’s accountants
audit (such audit to be at PurchaserÂ’s sole cost and expense) financial
statements of the Business for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, in a
form consistent with the Financial Statements. Nothing contained in this
Section 5.08 shall obligate Seller to breach any duty of confidentiality owed
to any person whether such duty arises contractually, statutorily or
otherwise; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if reasonably requested in writing
by Purchaser, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a waiver
of such duty of confidentiality (it being understood that Seller shall not be
required to expend money in connection therewith unless advanced by
Purchaser).

  

## 

  

### (b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, Seller shall
prepare and shall deliver to Purchaser (i) unaudited Statements of Net Sales
and Profits Before Indirects of the Business for the period beginning January
1, 2008 and ending on the last day of the last full fiscal quarter ended
prior to the Closing Date, which shall be in a form consistent with the
Unaudited Management Account, and (ii) unaudited Combined Statements of
Assets and Liabilities of the Business at the last day of the last

  



        
   

  



  

full fiscal quarter ended prior to the Closing Date, which shall be in a form
consistent with the Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 5.09. _Further Assurances_. (a) After the Closing, each party
shall take such further actions and execute such further documents as may be
reasonably necessary or reasonably requested by the other party (including
with respect to information held by Seller or the Seller Affiliates and their
agents in respect of regulatory filings for Transferred Trademarks) in order
to effectuate the intent of this Agreement and to provide such other party in
all material respects with the intended benefits of this Agreement. Each
party shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with fulfilling any
obligations pursuant to this Section 5.09.

  

## 

  

### (b) For a period of 90 days after the Closing (and, with SellerÂ’s written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), for up to three
successive 30-day periods thereafter if requested by Purchaser), Seller
shall, or shall cause its affiliates to, at PurchaserÂ’s sole cost and
expense, provide such assistance as Purchaser may reasonably request in
connection with the transition of SellerÂ’s Canadian marinades business
to Purchaser after the Closing Date, which assistance may include Seller or
the Seller Affiliates selling Products of the Canadian Marinades Business on
behalf of Purchaser (provided that such assistance does not unreasonably
disrupt the normal operations of Seller or its affiliates); it being
understood and agreed that nothing in this Section 5.09(b) shall convey to
Purchaser in any manner whatsoever any right to use the "Knorr" name or mark.

(collectively, " _Losses_ "), to the extent arising or resulting from any of

##

#### 

  

#### (ii) any breach of any covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement;

  

####

#### (iv) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by Seller

## SECTION 8.02. _Indemnification by Purchaser._  Subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 8.04, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and each of its affiliates and
each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents
and representatives (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and

hold harmless any Seller Indemnitee from or against any Loss if Purchaser has
paid the Termination Fee as a result of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.01(a)(v).

  



  

## SECTION 8.03. _Indemnification Procedures._ (a) _Procedures Relating to
Indemnification of Third Party Claims._ If any party (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") receives written notice of the commencement of
any action or proceeding or the assertion of any Claim by a third party or
the imposition of any penalty or assessment for which indemnity may be sought
under Section 8.01 or 8.02 (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), and such Indemnified
Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article VIII, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly provide the other party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") with written notice of such Third Party Claim, stating the nature,
basis and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the
relevant notices and documents (including court papers) evidencing such Third
Party Claim and the basis for indemnification sought and otherwise in
reasonable detail. The failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this
indemnification, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume the
defense of the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel
of its choice, which counsel must be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance herewith, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred
by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, (ii) the
Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel (not reasonably objected to
by the Indemnifying Party) at its sole cost and expense and participate in
the defense of the Third Party Claim, it being understood that the
Indemnifying Party shall control such defense, (iii) the Indemnifying Party
will not (A) admit to any wrongdoing or (B) consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
to the extent such judgment or settlement provides for equitable (including
injunctive) relief, in each case, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, (such written consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed ) and (iv) all the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense
or prosecution thereof, including the retention and (upon the Indemnifying
PartyÂ’s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnification
hereunder if it admits any liability with respect to, or consents to the
entry of any judgment or enters into any settlement with respect to or
otherwise compromises or discharges the Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (other than for Claims in respect
of Taxes, such written consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
If the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Party may file any papers, admit any liability with
respect to, or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to or otherwise compromise or discharge any Third
Party Claim upon not less than ten daysÂ’ prior written notice to the
Indemnifying Party. The parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to

  



        
   

  



  

## minimize Losses from Third Party Claims and will act in good faith in
responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with such
Claims. The parties will also cooperate in any such defense and give each
other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, such
Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party
hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment that was consented
to without the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s prior written consent.

  

## 

  

### (b) _Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims._  The Indemnified Party will
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing promptly of its discovery of any
matter that does not involve a Third Party Claim and that gives rise to a
claim of indemnity pursuant hereto, with such written notice stating the
nature, basis and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies
of the relevant notices and documents (including court papers) evidencing
such matter and the basis for indemnification sought and otherwise in
reasonable detail. The failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of
this indemnification, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party will have 60 days from
receipt of any such notice to give notice of dispute of the claim to the
Indemnified Party, which notice shall state in reasonable detail the
reason(s) for such dispute. The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate
and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim
for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such
matters. Such assistance and cooperation will include providing reasonable
access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such
matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and
resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with
respect to such matters.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 8.04. _Limitations on Indemnification._ (a) Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Article VIII, (i) neither party shall be
liable, pursuant to Section 8.01 or Section 8.02, for any
indemnifiable Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee or any Seller
Indemnitee, as applicable, arising out of a breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant herein unless a claim therefor is asserted in writing
within the applicable Survival Period, failing which such claim shall be
waived and extinguished, (ii) Seller shall not be liable, pursuant to Section
8.01(i), for (x) any Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee arising out
of a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller herein unless the
aggregate of all such Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees exceeds,
on a cumulative basis, $7,500,000, and then only to the extent of any such
excess or (y) the first fifteen individual items where the Loss relating
thereto is less than $50,000 and such fifteen items shall not be aggregated
for purposes of the immediately preceding clause (x), (iii) the
aggregate liability of Seller hereunder, pursuant to Section 8.01(i), for
Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees shall in no event exceed
$120,000,000, and (iv) neither party hereto shall be liable to the other for
indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages claimed by
such other party resulting from such first partyÂ’s breach of its
representations, warranties or covenants hereunder. In no event shall Seller
be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees or any other person with
respect to any matter to the extent that such matter was taken into account
in the calculation of the adjustment to the Closing Date Payment,

  



        
   

  



  

## if any, pursuant to Section 2.03(c). The representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and in any document
delivered in connection herewith shall survive the Closing solely for
purposes of this Article VIII as follows (each, a " _Survival Period_ "): (i)
the representations and warranties in Articles III and IV shall survive
for eighteen months following the Closing Date except that, the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.01 and 4.01
(Organization and Standing), Sections 3.02 and 4.02 (Authority; Execution and
Delivery; Enforceability) and Section 3.05 (Good and Valid Title) shall
survive until the applicable statute of limitations expires and except that
the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.09 (Taxes)
shall survive until the statute of limitations with respect to any Taxes
described therein expires (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
extension thereof) and (ii) the covenant in Section 5.02 (Access to
Information) shall not survive the Closing and all other covenants herein
shall survive in accordance with their respective terms.

  

## 

  

### (b) Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with each other with
respect to resolving any Claim or liability with respect to which one party
is obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by making
reasonable best efforts to mitigate or resolve any such Claim or liability.

  

### 

  

### (c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, (i) other than the
representations and warranties of Seller specifically contained in Article
III of this Agreement and in the Ancillary Agreements, none of Seller, any of
its affiliates or any other person has made any representation or warranty
either expressed or implied (A) with respect to the Business, the Transferred
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the transactions contemplated hereby or by
the Ancillary Agreements or (B) as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the Business, the Transferred Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary
Agreements furnished or made available to Purchaser and its representatives,
(ii) Purchaser has not relied on any representation or warranty from Seller,
any Seller Affiliate or any other person in determining to enter into this
Agreement, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and (iii) Purchaser shall have no claim or right to
indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, and none of Seller, any of its
affiliates or any other person shall have or be subject to any liability to
Purchaser or any other person with respect to, any information, documents or
materials furnished by Seller, any of its affiliates or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors to Purchaser,
including the Confidential Memorandum dated July 2007 prepared by Lehman
Brothers and any information, documents or material made available to
Purchaser and its representatives in certain "data rooms", management
presentations or any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (it being understood that this clause (iii) does not
supersede or otherwise affect the representations and warranties of Seller
specifically contained in Article III of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements, neither Seller nor any of the Seller Affiliates
makes any representations or warranties relating to the maintenance, repair,
condition, design, performance or marketability of any Transferred Asset,

  



        
   

  



  

### including merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that it shall obtain rights in the Transferred
Equipment and the Transferred Inventory in their present condition and state
of repair, "as is" and "where is".

  

### 

  

### (d) Each of Purchaser and Seller further acknowledges and agrees that,
should the Closing occur, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all Claims relating to this Agreement, the Business, the Transferred
Assets, the Excluded Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Retained
Liabilities or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than (i) a Claim
for payment due pursuant to Section 2.03(c), (ii) Claims of, or causes of
action arising from, fraud, (iii) claims arising solely under any Ancillary
Agreement and (iv) as provided in Section 11.14) shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each of Seller and Purchaser hereby waives, from and after the
Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than (i) a
claim for payment due pursuant to Section 2.03(c), (ii) claims of, or causes
of action arising from, fraud, (iii) claims arising solely under any
Ancillary Agreement and (iv) as provided in Section 11.14) it may have
against the other party or any of such other partyÂ’s affiliates or any of
their respective directors, officers and employees arising under or based
upon this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, any document or certificate
delivered in connection herewith, any Federal, state, provincial, local or
foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation, common law or otherwise
(except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
VIII).

  

### 

  

## SECTION 8.05. _Calculation of Indemnity Payments._  (a) The amount of any
Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article VIII shall be
net of any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party under third party
insurance policies with respect to such Loss and shall be (a) increased to
take account of any net Tax cost actually incurred by the Indemnified Party
arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such
increase) and (b) reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of
any such indemnified amount. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or
Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other
items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item
arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence
or payment of any indemnified amount. Following payment by the Indemnifying
Party of any Losses, if the Indemnified Party receives any third party
insurance recovery in respect of such Losses, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such insurance
recovery (but not more than the amount of such Losses). The Losses paid by
the Indemnifying Party in respect of which there has been a third party
insurance recovery that the Indemnified Party has paid over to the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with the preceding sentence shall not be
counted toward the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s maximum aggregate liability under
Section 8.04. The Indemnified Party agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
pursue and collect on any recovery available from any insurance policy
available to it and to net any such recovery against any claim for
indemnification hereunder or, if an indemnification claim has already been
resolved, against the amount paid pursuant to such resolution.

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) For purposes of determining the amount of the Loss in respect of any
indemnity claim pursuant to Sections 8.01 and 8.02 (but not for purposes of
the initial determination as to whether an inaccuracy exists or a breach has
occurred giving rise to a right of indemnification), the representations and
warranties made by each of Seller and Purchaser in this Agreement shall be
read without regard to any "Business Material Adverse Effect", "Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality qualifiers contained therein.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 8.06. _Tax Treatment of Indemnification._ For all Tax purposes,
Purchaser and Seller agree to treat (and shall cause each of their respective
affiliates to treat) any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price unless a final determination by the
relevant Taxing Authority (which shall include, in the case of the Internal
Revenue Service (the "IRS"), the execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor
form) provides otherwise.

ARTICLE IX

  



  

# _Tax Matters_

  



  

## SECTION 9.01. _Tax Matters._ (a) (i) At least fourteen (14) calendar
days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser with an
estimate of the allocation of the total consideration (including liabilities
assumed) among the Transferred Assets. This estimate will be used at the
Closing. If Purchaser does not agree with such estimate, Seller and Purchaser
shall use good faith efforts to agree on an estimate prior to the Closing
Date. If the parties cannot agree on such estimate prior to the Closing Date,
SellerÂ’s estimate shall be used for allocating the total consideration
pursuant to this Agreement at the Closing.

  

## 

  

##### (ii) Without regard to the estimate determined pursuant to Section
9.01(a)(i), within ninety (90) calendar days of the determination of the
Final Purchase Price, Seller shall provide Purchaser a proposed allocation
(the " _Allocation_ ") prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder of the total
consideration (including liabilities assumed) among the Transferred Assets.
The Allocation shall become final and binding twenty (20) calendar days after
Seller provides the Allocation to Purchaser, unless Purchaser objects in good
faith. In that case, the parties will attempt in good faith to agree upon the
Allocation. If the parties cannot agree on the Allocation, each party hereto
shall use its own allocation, as each such party shall deem appropriate.

  

##### 

  

##### (iii) Any adjustments to the Final Purchase Price shall be allocated in
accordance with the agreement reached as set forth in Section 9.01(a)(ii).

  

##### 

  

##### (iv) Seller (and its affiliates) and Purchaser (and its affiliates)
agree to file all Tax Returns consistent with the final versions of the
allocations and forms described in this Section 9.01.

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) (i)  Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in timely making all
filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required in connection with
PurchaserÂ’s and SellerÂ’s payment of Transfer Taxes. Each party shall execute
and deliver all instruments and certificates reasonably necessary to enable
the other to comply with any filing requirements relating to any such
Transfer Taxes.

  

### 

  

##### (ii) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall pay one-half of the aggregate
amount of any Transfer Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Seller
and each of the Seller Affiliates shall use reasonable efforts to avail
itself of any available exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes, and to
cooperate with the other parties in providing any information
and documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemption.

  

##### 

  

### (c) Purchaser, Seller and each of the Seller Affiliates agree, until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, to provide each other
with such information and assistance as is reasonably necessary, including
access to records and personnel, for the preparation of any Tax Returns or
for the defense of any Tax claim or assessment, whether in connection with an
audit or otherwise.

  

### 

  

### (d) Seller shall furnish to Purchaser on or prior to the Closing Date a
certificate of its non-foreign status complying with the provisions of United
States Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b).

Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
