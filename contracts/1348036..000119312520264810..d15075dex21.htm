favor of Parent in the form substantially attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (a "
_Support Agreement_ ") and (ii) each Stockholder is entering into and
delivering to Parent a written consent adopting this Agreement and approving

In consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

       1.7 |

Treatment of Shares 

---|--- 
 

As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and, subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, including with respect to the limitations and
timing of payments set forth in this Section 1.7, without any action on the
part of the holders thereof:

(a) All shares of any class of capital stock of the Company held or owned
directly or indirectly by the Company as treasury shares shall be cancelled.
No consideration will be delivered or deliverable for such shares.

 

(b) Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Dissenting Shares for which appraisal
rights are perfected as provided in Section 1.8, will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration in
an amount equal (i) (A) to the Per Share Amount, _multiplied by_  (B) the
percentage equal to 100% _minus_ the Holdback Percentage, _plus_ (ii) the
amounts, if any, that become payable in respect of such share of Company
Common Stock in the future from the Holdback Account and the
Stockholder Representative Expense Fund, as provided in this Agreement (the
amounts referred to in this clause (ii), the " _Post_ _-Closing Payment
Amount_").

 

(c) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) The amount of cash that any Stockholder is entitled to receive pursuant to
this Section 1.7 shall be rounded down to the nearest cent and computed after
aggregating the consideration to which such Stockholder is entitled to receive
in respect of all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by such
Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time.



   1.8 |

Dissenters Rights. 

---|--- 
 

(a) Stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL and who
have complied with all the requirements for perfecting appraisal rights, as
required under the DGCL, shall be entitled to their appraisal rights under the
DGCL with respect to such shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall effectively withdraw or permanently lose (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) such holders appraisal rights, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the
portion of the Merger Consideration to which such holder is then entitled
under this Agreement, without interest thereon and upon surrender of the
certificate representing such shares in accordance with this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
Dissenting Shares held by a Stockholder who has validly perfected such
Stockholders appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with the DGCL
shall not be converted into the right to receive any portion of the Merger
Consideration.

 



-3- 

    

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of shares, attempted written withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company relating to Stockholders rights to appraisal with respect to the
Merger and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any exercise of such appraisal rights under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for payment of fair
value for capital stock of the Company or interest thereon, offer to settle or
settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. Any
payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration
that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares in accordance
with this Agreement or other Losses in respect of any Dissenting Shares
(including attorneys and consultants fees, costs and expenses and including
any such fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with investigating,
defending against or settling any Claim) are collectively referred to herein
as the " _Dissenting Share Payments_ ".

 



   1.9 |

Holdbacks 

---|--- 
 

(a) At the Closing, an amount equal to the Holdback Amount (consisting of the
General Indemnity Holdback Amount, the Special Indemnity Holdback Amount and
the NWC Holdback Amount) will be deposited by Parent in a segregated account
(the " _Holdback Account_ ") as a partial mechanism to satisfy the
indemnification obligations of the Stockholders pursuant to Article VI
and the obligations of the Stockholders under Section 1.15.

(b) The portion of the General Indemnity Holdback Amount, net of the
amount of any outstanding claims for indemnification that have been validly
noticed or filed pursuant to this Agreement, and less amounts delivered to
Parent pursuant to Section 1.15(c) or Section 6.5(b) in satisfaction of
claims, will be released to the Paying Agent for distribution to the
Stockholders in accordance with each Stockholders Pro Rata Share within ten
(10) Business Days after the eighteen month anniversary of the Closing.

 

(c) The portion of the Special Indemnity Holdback Amount, net of the amount of
any outstanding claims for indemnification for Special Indemnification
Matters or IP Representations that have been validly noticed or filed pursuant
to this Agreement, and less amounts delivered to Parent pursuant Section
6.5(b) in satisfaction of claims, will be released to the Paying Agent
for distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with each Stockholders
Pro Rata Share within ten (10) Business Days after the earlier to occur of (i)
the third anniversary of the Closing and (ii) the satisfaction of each of
the items set forth on _Schedule 1.9(c)_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, an amount equal to
$26,439,065.74 (such amount the " _Performance Holdback Amount_ "), will not
be paid to the Founder Stockholder in connection with the Closing and,
instead, following the date on which Parent files its Annual Report on Form
10-K with Securities Exchange Commission for the applicable Performance
Measurement Period, but subject to achievement of the performance thresholds
set forth on _Schedule 1.9(d)_ , the Founder Stockholder shall be paid,
without interest, an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Performance
Holdback Amount. Except as set forth on Schedule 1.9(d), the Founder
Stockholder shall not be entitled to receive any payments from
the Performance Holdback Amount with respect to a Performance Measurement
Period pursuant

 



-4- 

    

 to the foregoing sentence, and Parent shall retain the applicable unpaid
portion of the Performance Holdback Amount, unless such the Company has
achieved the performance metrics set forth on  _Schedule 1.9(d)_.



   1.10 |

Letter of Transmittal and Surrender of Forms; Payment of Merger Consideration 

---|--- 
 

(a) Parent will act as Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") in the Merger.

 

(b) Paying Agent has delivered or will, promptly following execution and
delivery of this Agreement, deliver to each holder of record of (i) a book-
entry share (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") or (ii) a certificate or certificates
(each a " _Certificate_ ") that, in case of each of (i) and (ii), immediately
prior to the Effective Time evidenced outstanding Company Common Stock and
whose Company Common Stock was converted into the right to receive a portion
of the Merger Consideration, a letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") substantially in the form attached hereto as ___Exhibit D_.
Upon surrender of a Book-Entry Share or Certificate, if any, for cancellation
to the Paying Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by Parent or the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the portion of the Merger Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.7,
and the Book-Entry Share or Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Stockholder, in a form
satisfactory to Parent, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the portion of the Merger
Consideration that such Stockholder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
1.7;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Paying Agent may, in their
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, require such
Stockholder to provide an indemnity agreement, in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, against any Claim
that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. No interest
shall accrue on the Merger Consideration. If the Merger Consideration (or any
portion thereof) is to be delivered to any Person other than the Person in
whose name the certificate or certificates representing shares of Company
Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition to such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay
to Parent any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration (or any portion thereof) to a Person other
than the registered holder of the certificate or certificates so surrendered,
or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid
or is not applicable. Any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains
unclaimed by the former holders of Company Common Stock for six (6) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any former holder of
Company Common Stock that has not complied with this Section 1.10 prior to the
end of such six-month period shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) but only as a general creditor
thereof for payment of its claim for its portion of the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither Parent nor any other party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to Applicable
Law, including abandoned property, escheat and similar laws.

(c) The portion of the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of
Company Common Stock as such pursuant to Section 1.7 shall be paid by Parent
or the Paying Agent to such

 



-5- 

    

 holder by wire transfer (or, at Parents or the Paying Agents election, by
check) (i) on the Closing Date in the case of Stockholders who delivered a
duly executed Letter of Transmittal and Certificate(s), if any, and other
documents, if any, required pursuant to Section 1.10(b) prior to the Closing
Date and (ii) within five (5) Business Days after the date on which the Paying
Agent receives such holders Letter of Transmittal, Certificate(s), if any,
Certificate(s) and other documents, if any, required pursuant to Section
1.10(b).



   1.11 |

Withholding Rights 

---|--- 
 

Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and any other Person
acting on Parents behalf (in each case, the " _Payor_ ") will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any other payments
contemplated by this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
Applicable Law. Except with respect to any payments treated as compensatory
payments for Tax purposes, the Payor shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) provide reasonable prior written notice to any Stockholder of any
intention to so deduct and withhold after Parents receipt of the Payment
Schedules from the Company, and (ii) cooperate with the Stockholder
Representative prior to the Closing in seeking to reduce or eliminate any
such deduction or withholding with respect to the Stockholders. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the proper Governmental
Body, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding were made.



   1.12 |

No Further Transfers 

---|--- 
 

After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers of any shares of Company
Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be forwarded to Parent or the Paying Agent
and shall be cancelled and exchanged in accordance with Section 1.10,
subject, in the case of Dissenting Shares, to Section 1.8.



   1.13 |

No Further Ownership Rights in Shares of Company Common Stock 

---|--- 
 

The portion of the Merger Consideration delivered upon surrender of and in
exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of
Section 1.7 will be deemed to have been delivered in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. At the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Common Stock issued before the Effective Time
will cease to exist, and each Certificate will represent only the right to
receive that portion of the Merger Consideration determined in accordance with
Section 1.7, _provided_ , _however_ , that Certificates representing
Dissenting Shares will entitle the holder thereof only to the right to
receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the DGCL.



   1.14 |

Estimated Closing Statement; Merger Consideration Spreadsheet 

---|--- 
 

(a) The Company has delivered to Parent a written statement, certified by the
Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Company (the "
_Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth: (i) an unaudited estimated
balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing, prepared in accordance with
GAAP; (ii) the estimated Net Working Capital as of the Closing; (iii) the

 



-6- 

    

 estimated amount of all Cash and Cash Equivalents, indicating the bank
accounts in which such cash is held; (iv) the estimated amount of all unpaid
Transaction Costs of the Company, in the aggregate and itemized to show the
amount payable to each Person (prior to reduction for, and the amount of, any

resulting from the foregoing. Parent shall prepare the

 



-7- 

    

 Post-Closing Statement in accordance with the principles and format
consistent with the calculation of Net Working Capital set forth on _Schedule
1.14_. The Post-Closing Statement shall include reasonable detail of the
calculation of variations from the Net Working Capital, Cash and Cash
Equivalents, Debt and Transaction Costs set forth in the Estimated Closing
Statement, if any. During the thirty (30) day period following delivery of
the Post-Closing Statement, Parent shall promptly provide to the Stockholder
Representative, upon reasonable prior notice, access to the books and records
(including financial records and supporting documents) of the Company and
access to employees of Parent and the Company (during normal business hours),
in each case, relating to the calculation of Net Working Capital, Cash and
Cash Equivalents, Debt and Transaction Costs in the Post-Closing Statement, as
the Stockholder Representative may reasonably request for the purpose of
verifying the Post-Closing Statement. Unless, within the 30-day period
following Parents delivery of the Post-Closing Statement, the Stockholder
Representative has tendered a written notice to Parent (the " _Dispute Notice_
") to the effect that the items contained in the Post-Closing Statement are
erroneous or have not been prepared in accordance with this Section 1.15,
setting forth in reasonable detail any such objection (each such item, an "
_Item of Dispute_ "), the Post-Closing Statement, including the Merger
Consideration and each of the other items set forth therein, shall be
conclusive and binding upon Parent and the Stockholder Representative (on
behalf of the Stockholders).

(b) If the Stockholder Representative delivers a Dispute Notice to Parent
within the 30-day period following Parents delivery of the Post-Closing
Statement, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use reasonable
efforts (including the provision by Parent to the Stockholder Representative
of such relevant information as the Stockholder Representative may reasonably
request) to resolve their differences concerning the Items of Dispute, and if
any Item of Dispute is so resolved, the Post-Closing Statement shall be
modified if necessary to reflect such resolution. If any Item of Dispute
remains unresolved after thirty (30) days from Parents receipt of the Dispute
Notice, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly retain Ernst
and Young or another mutually acceptable independent and nationally or
regionally recognized accounting (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve such
remaining Items of Dispute. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
request that the Accounting Firm render a determination as to each unresolved
Item of Dispute (and as to no other matter) within thirty (30) days of its
retention, and Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall cooperate with
the Accounting Firm so as to enable it to make such determination as quickly
and as accurately as practicable. Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall provide the Accounting Firm with their respective determinations of
Items of Dispute, as well as all supporting documentation reasonably required
by the Accounting Firm to evaluate the Items of Dispute. The Accounting Firms
function shall be to resolve the Items of Dispute that have not been resolved
by Parent and the Stockholder Representative as an accounting expert and not
as an arbitrator. The Accounting Firms determination as to each Item of
Dispute submitted to it shall be in writing, shall conform with this Section
1.15 and shall be conclusive and binding upon Parent and the Stockholder
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders). The Accounting Firm shall
address only those items disputed in accordance with this Section 1.15 and
shall be bound by the definitions of Net Working Capital, Cash and Cash
Equivalents, Debt and Transaction Costs set forth in this Agreement. For each
disputed item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party in the Post-
Closing Statement or Dispute Notice, as the case may be, or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party in the Post-Closing
Statement or Dispute Notice, as the case may be. The Post-Closing Statement
shall be

 



-8- 

    

 modified if necessary to reflect such determination. The Accounting Firm
shall allocate its costs and expenses to the Non-Prevailing Party or, if there
is not a single Non-Prevailing Party, equally to Parent and the Stockholder
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders). For the purposes of the
preceding sentence, the " _Non-Prevailing Party_" __ is the party whose
proposed calculation of all Items of Dispute submitted to the Accounting Firm,
in the aggregate, was further from the calculation of the Items of Dispute
determined by the Accounting Firm and differed from that calculation by more
than 10% of the Items of Dispute, in the aggregate, as determined by the
Accounting Firm. The Stockholder Representatives portion of the
Accounting Firms fees and expenses payable hereunder shall be paid from the
NWC Holdback Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that if insufficient funds are
available in the NWC Holdback Amount, Stockholder Representatives portion of
such fees and expenses shall be paid from the General Indemnity Holdback
Amount or by the Stockholders.

(c) The Merger Consideration shall be finally determined in accordance with
this Section 1.15. If the finally determined Merger Consideration is equal to
or greater than the Estimated Merger Consideration, then within two (2)
Business Days after such final determination of the Merger Consideration, (i)
Parent shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent the amount of the
difference, if any, between such finally determined Merger Consideration and
the Estimated Merger Consideration, for distribution to the Stockholders in
accordance with each Stockholders Pro Rata Share and (ii) Parent shall (x)
disburse to the Accounting Firm from the NWC Holdback Amount the amount of
fees owed by the Stockholder Representative pursuant to Section 1.15(b), if
any, and (y) disburse the remainder of the NWC Holdback Amount to the Paying
Agent for distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with each
Stockholders Pro Rata Share, less any Taxes required to be withheld pursuant
to Section 1.11. If the finally determined Merger Consideration is less than
the Estimated Merger Consideration, then within two (2) Business Days after
such final determination of the Merger Consideration, Parent shall (i)
permanently retain from the NWC Holdback Amount an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the Estimated Merger Consideration and the finally
determined Merger Consideration (the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), (ii) disburse
to the Accounting Firm from the NWC Holdback Amount (or, if remaining funds in
the NWC Holdback Amount are insufficient, from the General Indemnity Holdback
Amount) the amount of fees owed by the Stockholder Representative pursuant
to Section 1.15(b), and (iii) disburse the remaining portion of the NWC
Holdback Amount, if any, to the Paying Agent for distribution to the
Stockholders in accordance with each Stockholders Pro Rata Share, less any
Taxes required to be withheld pursuant to Section 1.11; _provided_ that if
the Shortfall Amount is greater than the NWC Holdback Amount, Parent may also
permanently retain from the General Indemnity Holdback Amount the difference
between such Shortfall Amount and the NWC Holdback Amount.

Stockholder and such Stockholders successors as if expressly confirmed and
ratified in writing by such Stockholder, and all defenses which may be
available to the Stockholders to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of
the Stockholder Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement are
waived. The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the
Stockholder Representative hereunder: (x) are coupled with an interest and
shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or
liquidation of the respective Stockholder and shall be binding on any
successor thereto, and (y) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any

agreement among a majority in interest of the Indemnifying Stockholders
according to their Pro Rata Additional Indemnity Share. The Stockholder
Representative may resign at any time upon giving thirty (30) Business Days

shall automatically be removed as the Stockholder Representative, without any
action on the part of Parent or any Stockholder.

(ii) In the event of the Stockholder Representatives resignation, death or
disability, a majority in interest of the Indemnifying Stockholders according

at the address set forth in such Indemnifying Stockholders Support Agreement.

 

(d) At the Closing, Parent will cause an amount equal to the Stockholder
Representative Expense Fund to be delivered to the
Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder Representative Expense Fund shall
be held by the Stockholder Representative in a segregated bank account and
shall be used solely for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the
Stockholder Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to the
terms specified herein. For income Tax purposes, the Stockholder
Representative Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Stockholders at the time of Closing.
The Stockholders shall not receive interest or other earnings on the
Stockholder Representative Expense Fund and the Stockholders irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Stockholder Representative any ownership right that
they may have in any interest that may accrue on funds held in the

Further Assurances 

---|--- 
 

From and after the Closing, the parties will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, execute, deliver, and file such further
documents, certificates, instruments, Contract, or other materials, and

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other

   5.2 |

Tax Matters 

---|--- 
 

(a) The Stockholder Representative, at the sole expense of the Stockholders,
shall timely file (or cause to be timely filed) all Tax Returns filed on IRS
Form 1065 (and corresponding or similar forms required to be filed under other
Applicable Laws) of TTCG that reflect items that flow through to, or are
otherwise reportable by, the Stockholders, for all periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date (collectively, " _Passthrough Returns_ "), and the
Stockholders shall timely pay all Taxes due with respect to Passthrough
Returns. All Passthrough Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
TTCGs past practice, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, and
subject to Sections 5.2(c) and 5.2(g). The Stockholder Representative shall
provide all Passthrough Returns to Parent for its review and comment no less
than ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date (taking into account any
validly obtained extensions of time to file) for the filing of such Tax
Returns, and the Stockholder Representative shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comments provided by Parent in good faith no less than five (5)
Business Days prior to the due date (taking into account any validly obtained
extensions of time to file) for the filing of such Tax Returns.

 

(b) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns required to be filed by each Group Company after the Closing
Date for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and for all Straddle
Periods, other than any Passthrough Returns (collectively, " _Pre_ _-Closing
 Returns_"). All such Pre-Closing Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the applicable Group Companys past practice, except as
otherwise required by Applicable Law and subject to Section 5.2(c).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the maximum
extent more likely than not permitted under applicable law, Transaction Tax
Deductions will be reflected on any Pre-Closing Returns (and, for this
purpose, the parties agree to apply the safe harbor election set forth in IRS
Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to determine the amount of deductions attributable
to the payment of any success based fees within the scope of such revenue
procedure). Parent shall deliver drafts of all Pre-Closing Returns which are
income Tax Returns to the Stockholder Representative for review no less than
ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date (taking into account any validly
obtained extensions of time to file) for the filing of such Pre-
Closing Returns, and shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments
provided by the Stockholder Representative in good faith no less than five (5)
Business Days prior to the due date (taking into account any validly obtained
extensions of time to file) for the filing of such Tax Returns.

 



-41- 

    

(c) It is the intention of the parties (including in each case in this Section
5.2, for the avoidance of doubt, the Stockholders) that the Restructuring,
together with and as part of an integrated plan with the Merger, shall be
treated for federal and applicable state and local income Tax purposes as the
acquisition by Parent of the assets of TTCG, immediately followed by the
contribution of such assets by Parent to the Surviving Corporation immediately
after the Merger, and the disposition by the Stockholders (other than the
Donee Stockholder) of the equity interests of TTCG (together, the " _Deemed
Asset Purchase_ "), in a taxable transaction in accordance with Revenue
Rulings 70-140 and 99-6 (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "). For Tax purposes,
the purchase price for the Deemed Asset Purchase will be equal to the TTCG
Portion of the Merger Consideration, as finally determined pursuant to Section
1.15, together with all liabilities of TTCG deemed assumed and treated as
purchase price for federal and applicable state and local income Tax purposes
(including TTCGs share of any Debt) and all other amounts included in
purchase price for federal and applicable state and local income Tax
purposes. Such purchase price for the Deemed Asset Purchase, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 1.15, will be allocated among the assets of
TTCG in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder. Parent shall deliver such allocation (the " _Asset
Allocation_ ") to the Stockholder Representative within sixty (60) days after
the final determination of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
1.15 for the Stockholder Representatives review and comment. The Stockholder
Representative will deliver written notice of any comments to the draft Asset
Allocation within thirty (30) days of the Stockholder Representatives
receipt thereof. If the Stockholder Representative does not deliver such
written notice within such thirty (30) day period, the Asset Allocation as
delivered by Parent shall become final and binding on the parties hereto. If
the Stockholder Representative delivers written notice of comments to the
draft Asset Allocation within such thirty (30) day period, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative agree to use good faith efforts to resolve any
disputes regarding the Asset Allocation. If Parent and the Stockholder
Representative are unable to agree upon the final Asset Allocation within
thirty (30) days following receipt by Parent of the Stockholder
Representatives written notice of comments, then either Parent or the
Stockholder Representative shall have the right to cause the disputed items to
be submitted to the Accounting Firm for resolution, in accordance with the
provisions of Section 1.15(b), _mutatis mutandis_. The Asset Allocation as
agreed upon by Parent and the Stockholder Representative (either because the
Stockholder Representative does not object in writing to the Asset Allocation
or as a result of good faith negotiations between Parent and the
Stockholder Representative) or as determined by the Accounting Firm shall be
final and binding upon all parties to this Agreement. Each party hereto shall
cause all Tax Returns to be filed consistently with the Intended Tax Treatment
and the Asset Allocation (as determined hereunder) and shall not take any
action or position before a Governmental Body which is inconsistent with the
Intended Tax Treatment or Asset Allocation, unless otherwise required in
connection with a good faith resolution of a Claim by any Governmental Body.

(d) The parties shall provide each other with such assistance as may
reasonably be requested by the others in connection with the preparation of
any Tax Return, or any Tax Claim. Such assistance shall include making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information or explanation of material provided hereunder and shall include
providing copies of relevant Tax Returns and supporting material. The parties
will provide each

 



-42- 

    

 other with any records or information that may be reasonably relevant to
such preparation, or Tax Claim; _provided_ that notwithstanding anything else
to the contrary herein, Parent and its Affiliates shall not be required to
provide any Tax Returns of Parent and its Affiliates (other than the Surviving
Corporation) to any other party.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
Section 6.5), following the Closing Date, Parent will have the right, in
Parents sole and absolute discretion, to conduct and control, through counsel
of Parents choosing, the defense of any Tax Claim (other than Tax Claims
described in Section 5.2(f)); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent
that any Tax Claim could reasonably give rise to an Indemnification Claim by
the Parent Indemnified Parties under Article VI, Parent will (i) provide
notice of such Tax Claim to the Stockholder Representative within twenty (20)
days after receiving written notice of the commencement of such Tax Claim from
the relevant Governmental Body ( _provided_ that any failure by Parent to
provide such notice to the Stockholder Representative within such period will
not relieve the Stockholders of any liability to any Parent Indemnified
Party, except and only to the extent that the Stockholder Representative
demonstrates that the Stockholders have been materially prejudiced by such
failure by Parent to provide such notice to the Stockholder Representative
within such period), (ii) provide to the Stockholder Representative all
information reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative regarding
such Tax Claim, (iii) permit the Stockholder Representative to evaluate and
comment on such Tax Claim, and (iv) reasonably and in good faith consider any
such reasonable comments of the Stockholder Representative provided in good
faith. Parent may settle, adjust or compromise any Tax Claim in Parents sole
and absolute discretion without the consent of the Stockholder Representative;
_provided_ , _however_ , that without the prior written consent of Stockholder
Representative, which shall be deemed to have been given unless the
Stockholder Representative shall have objected within twenty (20) days after a
written request for such consent is given to the Stockholder Representative by
Parent, no settlement, adjustment or compromise of any Tax Claim shall be
determinative of the existence of a claim for indemnification under Article VI
or the amount of Losses relating to such claim. In the event that the
Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement, adjustment or
compromise, neither the Stockholder Representative nor any Stockholder shall
have any power or authority to object under any provision of Article VI to the
amount of any claim by any Parent Indemnified Party against the Holdback
Amount or otherwise for indemnity with respect to such settlement, adjustment
or compromise.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
Section 6.5), following the Closing Date, the Stockholder Representative, at
the sole expense of the Stockholders, will have the right, in its sole and
absolute discretion, to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing,
the defense of any Tax Claim with respect to any Passthrough Returns (a "
_Passthrough Tax Contest_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Stockholder
Representative will (i) provide notice of such Passthrough Tax Contest to
Parent within twenty (20) days after receiving written notice of the
commencement of such Passthrough Tax Contest from the relevant Governmental
Body, (ii) provide to Parent all information reasonably requested by Parent
regarding such Passthrough Tax Contest, (iii) permit the Parent to evaluate
and comment on such Passthrough Tax Contest, (iv) reasonably and in good faith
consider any such reasonable comments of Parent provided in good faith, and
(v) comply with Section 5.2(g). Stockholder Representative may settle, adjust
or compromise any Passthrough Tax Contest; _provided_ , _however_ , that to
the extent that any Passthrough Tax Contest could reasonably give rise to an 

 



-43- 

    

 Indemnification Claim by the Parent Indemnified Parties under Article VI,
Stockholder Representative will not settle, adjust or compromise any
Passthrough Tax Contest without the prior written consent of Parent (not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, the Stockholder Representative shall
(i) neither cause nor permit any election to be made by TTCG to apply the
partnership audit rules included in Sections 6221 through 6241 of the Code
(as in effect after 2017 and as amended by the BBA) and any corresponding or
similar provisions of other Applicable Law to any year ending on or prior to
December 31, 2017, (ii) cause an election under Section 6226(a) of the Code
(as in effect after 2017 and as amended by the BBA) and any corresponding or
similar provisions of other Applicable Law to be made with respect to TTCG for
all periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and (iii) cause TTCG to
designate the Stockholder Representative as the "partnership representative"
of TTCG under Section 6223 of the Code (as in effect after 2017 and as amended
by the BBA) and any corresponding or similar provisions of other Applicable
Law for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018.

(h) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other such Taxes (including any penalties and interest thereon) incurred
in connection with the Transactions (" _Transfer Taxes_ "), if any, shall be
borne by the Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that all Transfer
Taxes incurred solely by reason of the Merger shall be borne 50% by Parent
and 50% by the Stockholders. The Stockholders Representative shall properly
prepare and timely file, at the Stockholders expense, all Tax Returns with
respect to such Taxes. 

(i) In the case of a Straddle Period: (i) the amount of ad valorem, property,
or other similar Taxes of the Group Companies that relate to the portion of
such Straddle Period through the end of the Closing Date shall be deemed to be
the total amount of such Taxes for the Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
Straddle Period up to and including the Closing Date, and (B) the denominator
of which is the total number of calendar days in such Straddle Period; and
(ii) the amount of all other Taxes of the Group Companies for the portion
of such Straddle Period through the end of the Closing Date will be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date. For purposes of clause (ii) of the preceding
sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other similar item (including,
without limitation, the effect of any graduated rates of Tax, but excluding
for the avoidance of doubt any Transaction Tax Deductions) that is calculated
on an annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period
through the end of the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined by
multiplying the total amount of such item allocated to the Straddle Period
times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in
the portion of the Straddle Period through the end of the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period.

 

(j) Following the Closing, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will
(and neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will cause or allow any of
its Affiliates to) file any election for any Group Company under Section 336
or 338 of the Code or any similar provision of foreign, state or local
Applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may amend or modify any
Tax Returns of a Group Company in Parents sole and absolute discretion
without the consent of the Stockholder Representative; provided, however,
that, with respect to any Tax Returns of a

 



-44- 

    

 Group Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods, without the prior written
consent of the Stockholder Representative, which shall be deemed to have
been given unless the Stockholder Representative shall have objected within
twenty (20) days after a written request for such consent is given to the
Stockholder Representative by Parent, no amendment or modification of such Tax
Returns shall be determinative of the existence of a claim for
indemnification under Article VI or the amount of Losses relating to such
claim. In the event that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any
such amendment or modification, neither the Stockholder Representative nor
any Stockholder shall have any power or authority to object under any
provision of Article VI to the amount of any claim by any Parent Indemnified
Party against the Holdback Amount or otherwise for indemnity with respect to
such amendment or modification.

(k) All Contracts regarding the sharing, indemnity or allocation of either
liability for Taxes or payment of Taxes to which any Group Company is a party
or by which any Group Company is bound (other than Customary Contracts) will
be terminated as of the Closing Date (and will have no further effect for any
taxable period).

 

(l) Any payment made in accordance with Article VI will be treated for Tax
purposes as an adjustment to the consideration paid by Parent under this
Agreement, unless otherwise required under Applicable Law.



   5.3 |

to time and (ii) shall not release or excuse any Stockholder who is also an
officer or director of the Company from his, her or its obligations under to
this Agreement or any other agreement or document contemplated by the
consummation or performance of any of the Transactions, nor shall such
Stockholder have any right of contribution, indemnification or right of
advancement from the Surviving Corporation or its successor or Parent with
respect to any Losses claimed by any of the Parent Indemnified Parties
against such Stockholder in his, her or its capacity as a Stockholder pursuant
to this Agreement or any other agreement or document contemplated by the

specified period following the Effective Time.

-45- 

    

 Liability / Cyber / Tech Errors and Omissions for the Company and (iii)
Professional Liability for TTCG (collectively, the " _Tail Insurance Coverage_
") in a form reasonably acceptable to Company and Parent, which shall provide
the applicable parties (including in the case of the DandO Tail, the Company DandO
Indemnified Parties) with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective
Time. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the DandO Tail
in full force and effect and continue to honor the obligations thereunder
until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time.

 

(c) This Section 5.3 (i) shall survive the consummation of the Merger, (ii) is
intended to benefit each Company DandO Indemnified Party and their respective
heirs, (iii) is in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have against

of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall be enforceable by the
Company DandO Indemnified Parties.

limitations set forth in Section 6.4(b), except as specified in Section
6.4(e)) or (ii) arising in connection with any Indemnification Claim based on
a breach of any of the Fundamental Representations or IP Representations
(which are subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 6.4(b) and 6.4(c),
respectively), the aggregate liability of each Stockholder pursuant to Section
6.2(a)(i) (such Losses taking into account such exceptions, the " _General
Claims Losses_ ") shall be limited to an amount equal to their Pro Rata Share
of the General Indemnity Holdback Amount then remaining in the Holdback
Account. Notwithstanding anything the contrary, except in the case of a
breach by the Donee Stockholder of its Fundamental Representations in any
Support Agreement or Letter of Transmittal executed by such Donee Stockholder,
the aggregate liability of the Donee Stockholder pursuant to Section 6.2(a)
and Section 6.2(b)(i) shall be limited to an amount equal to its Pro Rata
Share of the General Indemnity Holdback Amount then remaining in the Holdback
Account in all circumstances.

 

(b) Except as specified in Section 6.4(e), the aggregate liability of each
Indemnifying Stockholder pursuant to Section 6.2 shall be limited to an
amount equal to the sum of (x) the portion of the Merger Consideration which
has been paid in respect of all Indemnifying Shares attributable to such
Indemnifying Stockholder plus (y) the portion of the Merger
Consideration then remaining in the Holdback Account that is attributable to
such Indemnifying Stockholders Actual Shares (and, if applicable, the
Performance Holdback Amount that is attributable to such Indemnifying
Stockholders Indemnifying Shares). Except as specified in Section 6.4(e), no
Indemnifying Stockholder shall be liable for an amount in excess of such
Indemnifying Stockholders Pro Rata Additional Indemnity Share of any Losses
covered by this Section 6.4(b). The aggregate liability of the Donee
Stockholder pursuant to Section 6.2 shall be limited to the portion of the
Merger Consideration then remaining in the Holdback Account that is
attributable to the Donated Shares plus, only in the case of Losses based on
a breach by the Donee Stockholder of Fundamental Representations in any
Support Agreement or Letter of Transmittal executed by such Donee Stockholder,
an amount equal to the portion of the Merger Consideration that has been paid
in respect of the Donated Shares.

(c) Except for Losses based on an Indemnification Claim pursuant to Section
6.2(a)(vii) or Section 6.2(b)(iii) (which are subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 6.4(b), except as specified in Section 6.4(e)), the aggregate
liability of each Indemnifying Stockholder for the sum of (x) Losses arising
in connection with any Indemnification Claim based on a breach of any of the
IP Representations pursuant to Section 6.2(a)(i) plus (y) General Claims
Losses shall be limited to an amount equal to thirty five percent (35%) of the
sum of (x) the portion of the Merger Consideration that has been paid in
respect of all Indemnifying Shares attributable to such Indemnifying
Stockholder plus (y) the portion of the Merger Consideration then remaining in
the Holdback Account that is attributable to such Indemnifying Stockholders
Actual Shares (and, if

 



-49- 

    

 applicable, the Performance Holdback Amount that is attributable to such
Indemnifying Stockholders Indemnifying Shares). No Indemnifying Stockholder
shall be liable for an amount in excess of such Indemnifying Stockholders
Pro Rata Additional Indemnity Share of any Losses covered by this Section
6.4(c).

(d) The aggregate liability of each Stockholder for Losses to the extent
arising in connection with the Special Indemnification Matters shall be
limited to an amount equal to their Pro Rata Share of the amounts of the
Special Indemnity Holdback Amount then remaining in the Holdback Account.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, with
respect to any Indemnification Claim pursuant to Section 6.2 finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be based on Fraud committed
by an Indemnifying Stockholder or in which such Indemnifying Stockholder
participated, caused or had actual knowledge of at the time of its
occurrence, the aggregate liability of such Indemnifying Stockholder pursuant
to Section 6.2 for any such Indemnification Claim shall be unlimited. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Stockholder shall be liable for any Losses arising out
of Fraud committed by any other Person, or in which such Stockholder did not
knowingly participate, knowingly cause or otherwise have actual knowledge of
at the time of its occurrence, in excess of the amount for which
such Stockholder would be liable for such Loss if not arising out of Fraud.

(f) In the case of any Indemnification Claim arising out of Section 6.2(a)(i)
or 6.2(b)(i), or Section 6.3(a), as applicable, the Stockholders or Parent, as
applicable, shall not be obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties
or the Company Indemnified Parties, as applicable, until the total amount of
Losses with respect to the aforementioned claims that the Parent Indemnified
Parties or the Company Indemnified Parties, as applicable, are entitled to
recover exceeds $2,827,500 (the " _Threshold_ "). If such Losses exceed the
Threshold, then the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible to indemnify the
Parent Indemnified Parties or the Company Indemnified Parties, as applicable,
for all Losses in excess of the Threshold. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this paragraph shall in no way limit, and the Threshold shall not
apply to, any Indemnified Partys right to indemnification for Losses arising
in connection with any Indemnification Claim based on Fraud or a breach of any
Fundamental Representation.

(g) The aggregate liability of Parent to all Company Indemnified Parties under
this Article VI shall be limited to an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration (inclusive of amounts paid in respect of Merger Consideration).

(h) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Stockholders shall not have any liability under Section 6.2(a)(i) of this
Agreement based on a breach of representations or warranties set forth in
Section 2.8 (Taxes) with respect to the amount or availability for any Tax
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date of any net
operating loss carryforward, capital loss carryforward, or Tax credit
carryforward of any Group Company.

 

(i) Except for Indemnification Claims pursuant to Section 6.2(a)(vii) or
Section 6.2(b)(iii), or 6.2(a)(iii) - (vi) and (viii) - (x), any Person
against whom an Indemnification Claim is being asserted (an " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") shall not be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless

 



-50- 

    

 any Person claiming indemnification under this Article VI for breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") after the
expiration of any Survival Period applicable to such representation, warranty
or covenant unless a Claim Notice with respect to such Indemnification Claim
shall have been given by the Indemnified Party prior to the expiration of the
applicable Survival Period. In addition, no claim may be brought in respect
of the Special Indemnification Matters following the earlier of (x) the date
that is thirty-six (36) months after the Closing Date and (y) the date on
which each of the items set forth on _Schedule 1.9(c)_ has been satisfied.

(j) The obligations of each Stockholder to indemnify the Parent Indemnified
Parties under Section 6.2, excluding with respect to the Special
Indemnification Matters, shall be first satisfied from the General Indemnity
Holdback Amount. If the full amount of the General Indemnity Holdback Amount
is paid to Parent in satisfaction of Indemnification Claims, any additional
liability of the Indemnifying Stockholders under Section 6.2 for any matters
for which recovery is not limited to the General Indemnity Holdback Amount
shall be satisfied from other assets of the Indemnifying Stockholders,
including by offset of amounts not yet paid by Parent under this Agreement or
any other Operative Document; _provided, however,_ that __ Parent may not
offset any such amounts owed by the Indemnifying Stockholders from the
Special Indemnity Holdback Amount except with respect to an Indemnification
Claim for breach of any of the IP Representations pursuant to Section
6.2(a)(i) or a claim pursuant to Section 6.2(a)(xi), subject in each case to
the limitations set forth in this Article VI. The aggregate value of
Indemnification Claims paid to the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be deemed
to reduce the Merger Consideration.

 

(k) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is sought pursuant to
this Article VI shall be reduced by (i) the amount of any third party
insurance proceeds actually recovered by any Indemnified Party from any third
party insurance carrier, net of any increase in insurance premiums or other
costs, including deductibles, incurred in connection with recovering such
insurance proceeds; and (ii) the amount of any indemnity or contribution
actually recovered by any Indemnified Party from any third party that is not
an Affiliate of Parent, net any costs incurred in connection with recovering
any such amounts;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing in no way
obligates any Indemnified Party to (x) purchase or maintain any third party
insurance policy or (y) seek recovery of any such insurance proceeds or
indemnity or contribution amounts from any Person, other than from the Tail
Insurance Coverage.

(l) No Indemnified Party shall have any liability under this Agreement for
any exemplary or punitive damages, except to the extent specifically awarded
by a governmental entity or arbitrator to a third party and paid to such third
party by an Indemnified Party (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
in connection with any Tax Claims or Passthrough Tax Contests).

(m) Solely for purposes of determining the amount of Losses under 6.2 and 6.3
(but not for purposes of determining whether a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation has occurred), all qualifications and
limitations as to materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect and words of
similar import set forth in this Agreement shall be disregarded.

       6.5 |

Procedure for Indemnification. 

---|--- 
 

Except with respect to Tax Claims and Passthrough Tax Contests, which shall be
governed exclusively by Section 5.2:

 

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give written notice (the " _Claim Notice_ ") of
any Indemnification Claim (i) in the case of an Indemnification Claim against
Parent, to Parent, and (ii) in the case of an Indemnification Claim against
the Stockholders, to the Stockholder Representative, reasonably promptly, but
in any event (A) prior to expiration of any applicable Survival Period, and
(B) if such Indemnification Claim relates to the assertion against an
Indemnified Party of any Claim by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "),
within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Indemnified Party of written
notice of a legal process relating to such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party within such
time period shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any obligation or
liability to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. A Claim Notice shall describe
in reasonable detail (to the extent known), including (i) the facts giving
rise to the Indemnification Claim (ii) the amount or method of computation of
the amount of such Indemnification Claim, and (iii) the nature of the breach
of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with respect to which
the Indemnified Party claims to be entitled to indemnification hereunder.

(b) An Indemnifying Party (or, in the case of an indemnification claim
against the Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative) shall have thirty
(30) days after a Claim Notice is received to contest such Indemnification
Claim in writing, describing in reasonable detail the basis for contesting
the Indemnification Claim. Disputed Indemnification Claims shall be resolved
either (i) in a written agreement signed by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative, or (ii) by the final judgment, order, award, decision or
decree of a court or other trier of fact. Any uncontested or finally
adjudicated amount of Losses related to an Indemnification Claim shall be paid
by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party, subject to the other terms
of this Article VI ( _provided_ that in the case of an Indemnification Claim
against the Stockholders, Parent shall have the right to permanently retain an
amount from any remaining General Indemnity Holdback or Special Indemnity
Holdback, as applicable, equal to the uncontested or finally adjusted amount
of Losses, subject to Section 6.4(i)).

(c) In the event of an Indemnification Claim against the
Stockholders involving a Third Party Claim, if the Stockholder Representative
delivers written notice to Parent within thirty (30) days after receiving
notice of such Third Party Claim that includes a written acknowledgement of
all applicable Indemnifying Parties indemnification obligations under this
Agreement with respect to such Third Party Claim and full responsibility for
all indemnifiable Losses related to such Third Party Claim, the Stockholder
Representative may assume the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ that the Stockholder Representative shall not be entitled to assume
or control the defense of a Third Party Claim that (i) seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief against Parent or its Affiliates (including the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries), (ii) involves criminal allegations or
claims by any Governmental Body, (iii) involves any Tax Claim, (iv) involves
an amount at issue that is likely to exceed the Holdback Amount, or (v)
related to a claim based on breach of the IP Representations. If the
Stockholder Representative so assumes and controls any such defense, the
Stockholder Representative shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim
actively and diligently. The Stockholder Representative may not compromise or
settle a suit, claim, or proceeding without the consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably

 



-52- 

    

 withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless (x) it acknowledges that all Losses
covered by such settlement are indemnifiable Claims under this Article VI, and
(y) it is a Claim for monetary damages only which will be satisfied in full
by the Stockholders. In assuming the defense of a matter hereunder, the
Stockholder Representative shall have the right to select counsel, _provided_
that Parent does not object to such counsel in a reasonable exercise of its
discretion. Parent shall have the right to engage its own counsel who may
associate with the counsel designated by the Stockholder Representative (upon
the Stockholder Representatives assumption of the defense of the matter),
but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the Parents expense,
unless (i) the engagement of such counsel shall have been authorized in
writing by the Stockholder Representative; (ii) the Stockholder
Representative shall have not engaged counsel to take charge of the defense of
such action after electing to assume the defense thereof; or (iii) in the
reasonable opinion of counsel for Parent, there is a conflict of
interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and that
there may be defenses available to it that are different from or in addition
to those available to the Stockholder Representative or the Stockholders (in
which case the Stockholder Representative shall not have the right to direct
the defense of such action on behalf of Parent or the other Parent Indemnified
Parties), in any of which events the reasonable fees and expenses of one
separate counsel for Parent or any Parent Indemnified Party shall be paid by
the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders). The
Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel and accountants at reasonable times and for reasonable
periods, during normal business hours, all books and records of the
Indemnified Party relating to the matter for which defense or indemnity has
been claimed (subject to any limitations on account of attorney-client or
similar privileges), and each party hereunder will render to the other such
assistance as the other may reasonably request in order to assure prompt and
adequate defense of any such suit, claim, or proceeding.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any Third Party Claim in which the
Stockholders are the Indemnifying Party and the Stockholder Representative
does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim (whether by election or
because the Stockholder Representative does not have, or loses the right to,
assume the defense and control of such Third Party Claim), (i) Parent
shall have the right to conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim and (ii)
Parent may settle, adjust or compromise such Third Party Claim with or without
the consent of the Stockholder Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that
without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, which
shall be deemed to have been given unless the Stockholder Representative shall
have objected within twenty (20) days after a written request for such consent
is given to the Stockholder Representative by Parent, no settlement,
adjustment or compromise of any Third Party Claim shall be determinative of
the existence of a claim for indemnification under this Article VI or the
amount of Losses relating to such claim. Parent will keep the Stockholder
Representative reasonably informed as to, and with respect to any Third Party
Claim arising out of, relating or based on a breach of the IP Representations,
give good faith consideration to the views of the Stockholder Representative
as to matters relating to, the defense or resolution of such Third Party
Claim. In the event that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any
such settlement, adjustment or compromise, neither the
Stockholder Representative nor any Stockholder shall have any power or
authority to object under any provision of this Article VI to the amount of
any claim by any Parent Indemnified Party against the General Indemnity
Holdback or Special Indemnity Holdback Amount or otherwise for indemnity with
respect to such settlement, adjustment or compromises, subject to the
limitations and terms set forth in this Article VI. Parent shall have the
exclusive right to assume and conduct the control of any Third Party Claim
giving rise to an Indemnification Claim made by the Company Indemnified
Parties.

provisions of Article VI shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of
the Parent Indemnified Parties and the Company Indemnified Parties
with respect to any Losses or Claims under this Agreement and the
certificates required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement (it being
understood that nothing in this Section 6.6 or elsewhere in this Agreement
will affect Parents or Surviving Corporations rights to equitable remedies
to the extent available). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit the remedies of Parent or Surviving Corporation under
any document or agreement other than this Agreement, the related schedules
and the certificates required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

Legal Representation 

---|--- 
 

(a) Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation) acknowledges and agrees that Gibson, Dunn
and Crutcher LLP (" _Gibson Dunn_ ") has acted as counsel for the Stockholders
and for the Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Acquisition Engagement_ "), and in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, Gibson Dunn has
not acted as counsel for any other Person, including Parent and Merger Sub.

 

(b) Only the Stockholders, the Company and their respective Affiliates, in
each case as of immediately prior to the Closing, shall be considered clients
of Gibson Dunn in the Acquisition Engagement. Parent, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation)
acknowledges and agrees that all confidential and privileged
communications between the Stockholders, the Company and their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Gibson Dunn, on the other hand, in the course
of the Acquisition Engagement, and any attendant attorney work product
protection, and expectation of client confidentiality applicable thereto,
shall be deemed to belong solely to the Stockholders and their respective
Affiliates (other than the Company), and not the Company, and shall not pass
to or be claimed, held, or used by Parent or the Company (or, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation) upon or after the Closing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) to
the extent that files of Gibson Dunn in respect of the Acquisition
Engagement constitute property of the client, only the Stockholders and their
respective Affiliates shall hold such property rights and (ii) Gibson Dunn
shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
privileged communications or files to the Company (or, after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation) or Parent by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Gibson Dunn and the Company or otherwise; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Gibson Dunn shall not disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to any third parties (other than
representatives, accountants and advisors of the Stockholders and their
respective Affiliates; provided that such representatives, accounts
and advisors are instructed to maintain the confidence of such attorney-
client communications). If and to the extent that, at any time subsequent to
Closing, Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation) shall have the right to assert or waive any attorney-
client privilege with respect to any communication between the Company or its
Affiliates and any Person representing them that occurred at any time prior to
the Closing, Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) shall be entitled to waive such
privilege only with the prior written consent of the Stockholders (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

 



-58- 

    

(c) Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation) acknowledges and agrees that Gibson Dunn
has acted as counsel for certain of the Stockholders and their respective
Affiliates for several years and that the Stockholders reasonably anticipate
that Gibson Dunn will continue to represent them and/or their respective
Affiliates in future matters. Accordingly, Parent, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) expressly
consents to Gibson Dunns representation of the Stockholders and/or their
respective Affiliates and/or any of their respective agents (if any of the
foregoing Persons so desire) in any post-Closing matter relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in which the interests of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the Stockholders or any of
their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse.

 

(d) The Acquisition Engagement with the Company shall terminate at the
Closing. From and after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall cease to
have any attorney-client relationship with Gibson Dunn, unless and to the
extent Gibson Dunn is expressly engaged in writing by the Surviving
Corporation to represent the Surviving Corporation after the Closing and
either (i) such engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to
the Stockholder and/or any of their respective Affiliates or (ii) the
Stockholders and/or any such Affiliate, a applicable, consent in writing to
such engagement. Any such representation of the Surviving Corporation by
Gibson Dunn after the Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions
hereof. Furthermore, Gibson Dunn, in its sole discretion, shall be permitted
to withdraw from representing the Surviving Corporation in order to represent
or continue so representing the Stockholders.

(e) Each of the parties to this Agreement consents to the arrangements in
this Section 7.14 and waives any actual or potential conflict of interest that
may be involved in connection with any representation by Gibson Dunn permitted
hereunder.
