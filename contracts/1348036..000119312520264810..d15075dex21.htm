the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, which shall be deemed to have been given unless the Stockholder Representative shall have objected within twenty (20)&nbsp;days after a written request for such consent is given to the
Stockholder Representative by Parent, no settlement, adjustment or compromise of any Third Party Claim shall be determinative of the existence of a claim for indemnification under this Article VI or the amount of Losses relating to such claim.
Parent will keep the Stockholder Representative reasonably informed as to, and with respect to any Third Party Claim arising out of, relating or based on a breach of the IP Representations, give good faith consideration to the views of the
Stockholder Representative as to matters relating to, the defense or resolution of such Third Party Claim. In the event that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement, adjustment or compromise, neither the Stockholder
