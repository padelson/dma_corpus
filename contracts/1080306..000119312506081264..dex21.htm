ARTICLE II

THE OFFER

2.1 _ The Offer_.

(a) _Terms of Offer; Conditions to Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall
not have been terminated pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (but in no event more than ten (10) Business
Days thereafter), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer
to purchase all of the Company Shares at a price per Company Share, subject to
the terms of _Section 2.1(b)_ hereof, equal to the Offer Price. The
obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Company
Shares tendered (and the obligation of Parent to cause Merger Sub to accept
for payment and to pay for any Company Shares tendered) shall be subject only
to (i) the condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that, prior to the then
scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended from time to
time pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ hereof), there be validly tendered in
accordance with the terms of the Offer and not withdrawn a number of shares
of Company Common Stock that, together with the Company Shares then owned by
Parent and Merger Sub (if any), represents at least a majority of (x) all then
outstanding Company Shares, _plus_ (y) all shares of Company Common Stock
issued or issuable upon the exercise of all then outstanding Company Options
with an exercise price that is equal to or less than $6.00, _plus_ (z) all
shares of Company Common Stock issued or issuable upon the exercise,
conversion or exchange of any other securities or other rights (other than the
Company Options) that are exercisable, convertible or exchangeable for shares
of Company Common Stock and (ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_
hereto. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to increase the
Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the
Offer; _provided, however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement
or previously approved by the Company in writing, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub may make any change to the terms and conditions of the Offer that (A)
decreases the Offer Price, (B) changes the form of consideration to be paid in
the Offer, (C) reduces the number of Company Shares to be purchased in the
Offer, (D) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to the conditions to
the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto, (E) amends the conditions to the
Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto so as to broaden the scope of such
conditions to the Offer, (F) extends the  



 

8  Offer in any manner other than pursuant to and in accordance with the terms
of _Section 2.1(c)_ hereof or (G) amends or waives the Minimum Condition.
The conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto are for the sole
benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub,
in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, in their sole
discretion, other than the Minimum Condition, which may be waived by Parent
and Merger Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company. The failure
by Parent and Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.

(b) _Adjustments to Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to Merger Subs acceptance for payment of, and payment
for, Company Shares pursuant to the Offer.

(c) _Extension and Expiration of Offer_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the Offer, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York
Time, on the date that is twenty (20) business days (for this purpose
calculated in accordance with Section 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)
after the date the Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act); _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i) Merger Sub shall
extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff, the Nasdaq or the NYSE
that is applicable to the Offer and (ii) in the event that any of the
conditions to the Offer, including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions set forth on _Annex A_ hereto, are not satisfied or waived as of
any then scheduled expiration date of the Offer, Merger Sub shall extend the
Offer for successive extension periods of ten (10) Business Days each in
order to permit the satisfaction of the conditions to the Offer; _provided,
however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this 
_Section 2.1(c)_, in no event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the
Offer beyond the Termination Date; and _provided further_ , that the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall not be deemed to impair,
limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Article IX_ hereof.

(d) _Payment for Company Shares_. Subject to the terms and conditions this
Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, as promptly as practicable after the
applicable expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance
with _Section 2.1(c)_ hereof). The Offer Price payable in respect of each
Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall
be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction only for
any applicable federal back-up withholding or other Taxes payable by such
holder.

(e) _Subsequent Offering Period_. Merger Sub may (but shall not be required
to), and the Offer Documents shall reserve the right to, extend the Offer for
a subsequent offering period (within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act) of not less than three (3) nor more than twenty (20) business
days immediately following the expiration of the Offer; _provided, however_ ,
that in the event that more than eighty percent (80%) of the then outstanding
Company Shares have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer on the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended in
accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ hereof), Merger Sub shall extend the Offer
for a subsequent offering period (within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act) of twenty (20) business days immediately following the
applicable expiration date of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as so extended by
such subsequent offering period, as promptly as practicable after any such
Company Shares are tendered during such subsequent offering period. The Offer
Price payable in respect of each Company Share validly  



 

9  tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, as so extended by such
subsequent offering period, shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash,
subject to reduction only for any applicable federal back-up withholding or
other Taxes payable by such holder.

(f) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents_. As soon as practicable on the date the
Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act),
Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) prepare and file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, and including all exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with
respect to the Offer, which shall contain as an exhibit or incorporate by
reference an Offer to Purchase, or portions thereof (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ "), and forms of the letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement, if any, in respect of the Offer (together with any supplements
or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to all holders of Company Shares (collectively,
the " _Company Stockholders_ "). Subject to the provisions of _Section 7.4_
hereof, the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents may include a description of
the determinations, approvals and recommendations of the Company Board set
forth in _Section 2.2(a)_ hereof. The Company shall promptly furnish to
Parent and Merger Sub in writing all information concerning the Company that

Parent and Merger Sub for inclusion in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents
so as to enable Parent to comply with its obligations under Section
2.1(a). Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Schedule TO and the Offer
Documents to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and all
other Legal Requirements. Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that the Schedule
TO and the Offer Documents, when filed with the SEC and on the date first

untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

pursuant to the Offer, deliver (and shall use their respective reasonable
efforts to cause their agents to deliver) to the Company any and all copies
and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their possession
or control (it being understood and hereby agreed that if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof, whether under circumstances in
which the Company is or may in the future be required to pay the Termination
Fee Amount pursuant to the provisions of _Section 9.4(b)_ hereof or
otherwise, and Parent and Merger Sub elect to continue the Offer (as may be
amended) notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article IX_ hereof, Parent and Merger Sub shall be permitted to retain and
use any and all such list of stockholders, mailing labels and listings or
files of securities positions for purposes of disseminating and otherwise
communicating the Offer and the related Offer Documents to the record and
beneficial holders of Company Shares notwithstanding the termination of this
Agreement).

(d) _Rights of First Refusal_. Solely in connection with the tender and
purchase of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the
Merger, the Company hereby waives any and all rights of first refusal it may
have with respect to Company Shares owned by, or issuable to, any Person,
other than rights to repurchase unvested shares, if any, that may be held by
Persons pursuant to the grant of restricted stock purchase rights or following
exercise of employee stock options.

2.3 _ Company Boards of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f) of Exchange
Act_.

(a) _Composition of Company Board_. Effective upon the initial acceptance for
payment by Merger Sub of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer (the "
_Appointment Time_ ," the use of which term herein shall not, unless
the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether Parent shall exercise its
rights under this _Section 2.3(a)_) and from time to time thereafter, Parent
shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors on the Company
Board equal to the product (rounded up to the next whole number) obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to
any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this _Section 2.3_) and
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Company Shares held
by Parent and Merger Sub (giving effect to the Company Shares purchased
pursuant to the Offer), and the denominator of which is the total number of
then outstanding Company Shares. Promptly following a request by Parent, the
Company shall take all action necessary to cause the individuals so designated
by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including by
increasing the size of the Company Board or by seeking and accepting or
otherwise securing the resignations of such number of then incumbent directors
as is necessary to enable the individuals so designated by Parent to be
elected or appointed to the Company Board. From time to time after
the Appointment Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to cause
the individuals so designated by Parent to constitute substantially the same
percentage (rounding up where appropriate) as is on the Company Board on (i)
each committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of directors of each
Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) each committee of each such board of
directors of each Subsidiary of the Company, in each case to the fullest
extent permitted by all applicable Legal Requirements. Solely for purposes of
this _Section 2.3_, any and all members of the Company Board immediately
prior to such appointments by Parent who remain on the Company Board after
such appointments by Parent shall be referred to as " _Continuing Directors_
" and each as a " _Continuing Director_."

(b) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to appoint
Parents designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated  



 

12  thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all action required pursuant to
this _Section 2.3_ and Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 2.3_, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9
such information with respect to the Company and its directors and officers as
is required under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 2.3_. Parent shall provide to the Company in
writing, and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself
and its nominees, directors, officers and affiliates, required by such
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

(c) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that Parents
designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ hereof and there shall be any Continuing
Directors, the approval of a majority of such Continuing Directors (or the
sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one (1) Continuing Director)
shall be required in order to (i) amend or terminate this Agreement, or agree
or consent to any amendment or termination of this Agreement, in any case on
behalf of the Company, (ii) extend the time for performance of, or waive, any
of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement,
(iii) waive any of the Companys rights under this Agreement or (iv) make any
other determination with respect to any action to be taken or not to be taken
by or on behalf of the Company relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger. In the event that
there are no Continuing Directors, Parent shall not take any of the actions
referenced in clauses (i)  (vi) of the preceding sentence, inclusive.

2.4 _ Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option
(the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only on or after the Appointment Time,
to purchase that number of Company Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ")
equal to the lowest number of Company Shares that, when added to the number of
Company Shares owned by Merger Sub at the time of such exercise, shall
constitute one share more than 90% of the Shares then outstanding (assuming
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares and the exercise of all outstanding
exercisable options to purchase Shares with an exercise price equal to or less
than $6.00) at a price per share equal to the Offer Price; _provided, however_
, that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless immediately after
such exercise and the issuance of Company Shares pursuant thereto, Merger Sub
would own more than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding; and _provided further, however_ , that in no event shall the
Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Shares in excess of the Companys
then authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock (giving effect to
shares of Company Common Stock reserved or issuance under the Company Option
Plans as though such shares were outstanding).

(b) Merger Sub may exercise the Top-Up Option, in whole but not in part, at
any one time after the occurrence of a Top-Up Exercise Event and prior to the
earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to its terms. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Top-Up
Exercise Event_ " shall occur only upon Merger Subs acceptance of Company
Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer or acquisition of Company Shares
pursuant to the Offer constituting at least 85% of the Company Shares then
outstanding.

shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by stockholders who shall have neither
voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall
have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL (collectively, " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 3.7_. Such stockholders shall be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all
Dissenting Company Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to
perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the

the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of
Company Common Stock in the manner provided in _Section 3.8_ hereof.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for

holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this 
_Article III_, an amount of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the Merger Consideration and (y) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding shares of Company Common Stock then owned Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, or any direct or indirect, wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether pursuant
to the Offer or otherwise)) (such cash amount being referred to herein as the
_"Exchange Fund"_ ).

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates
(the " _Certificates_ "), which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting

specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment

thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ , and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent
shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to
this _Section 3.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates shall be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article III_.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name
other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor
are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the
Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting
such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent
designated by Parent) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are
otherwise not payable.



 

16 (e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted
or withheld therefrom under United States federal or state, local or foreign
law. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement.

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates on the
date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore surrendered their Certificates evidencing such shares of Company
Common Stock for exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 3.8_
shall thereafter look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock evidenced by such Certificates
solely to Parent, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the
applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

3.9 _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after
the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate theretofore representing any shares of
Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares) shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 3.8_ hereof. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of the
Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance
with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article III_.

3.10 _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 3.7_
hereof; _provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

3.11 _ Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and
officers of the Company and Merger Sub shall take all such lawful and
necessary action.

disclosure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of Trade Secrets owned by
another Person have been pursuant to the terms of a written agreement with
such Person or was otherwise lawful, except to the extent that any use or
disclosure of any Trade Secret owned by another Person that was not done in

a Company Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries have a policy requiring employees and certain
consultants and contractors to execute a confidentiality and assignment
agreement substantially in the Companys standard form previously provided to
Parent. The Company and its Subsidiaries have enforced such policy, except

operation of the Companys or its Subsidiaries business has infringed upon or

claim challenging the validity or  



 

27  enforceability of, or contesting the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries
rights with respect to, any of the Company IP. The Company and
its Subsidiaries are not subject to any Order of any Governmental Entity that
restricts or impairs the use of any Company Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights, other than restrictions or impairments that
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(k) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) will
not result in any right of termination or cancellation under any Company IP
Agreement, except where the foregoing would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or after the Merger, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries being
required, under the terms of any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, to grant any third party any rights or licenses to
any of Parents or any of its Subsidiaries material Intellectual Property or

Company Product to require release of such Company Source Code, other than
conditions that relate to the solvency or financial condition of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or that relate to the involvement of the Company or
its Subsidiaries in any bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors,
or other activity or proceeding under Legal Requirements relating to
insolvency or the protection of creditors. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) will not
constitute a condition sufficient to entitle the beneficiary under any source
code escrow arrangement under which the Company has deposited any material
Company Source Code for any Company Product to require release of such Company
Source Code.

(n) The Companys and its Subsidiaries collection and dissemination of
personal customer information in connection with their business has been
conducted in accordance with applicable privacy policies published or
otherwise adopted by the Company and its Subsidiary and any applicable Legal
Requirements, except where the failure to abide by any such Legal Requirements
will not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

material policies of insurance covering the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective employees, properties or assets, including policies of
life, property, fire, workers compensation, products liability, directors
and officers liability and other casualty and liability insurance, that is
in a form and amount that is customarily carried by persons conducting
business similar to that of the Company and which the Company believes is
adequate for the operation of its business. All such insurance policies are
in full force and effect, no written notice of cancellation has been received
by the Company under such policies, and there is no existing default or event
which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a

or disputed by the underwriters of such policies and there has been no

such policies.

Merger Sub contained in _Section 5.6_ hereof are accurate, and if the

respective affiliates) and, as of the date of this Agreement, such opinion
has not been withdrawn, revoked or modified in any material respect.

4.27 _ Anti-Takeover Statutes_. Assuming that the representations of Parent
and Merger Sub contained in _Section 5.6_ are accurate, the Company Board has
taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business combinations
set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar applicable Legal
Requirement are not applicable to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the Tender
and Voting Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby. No other
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation, domestic or foreign,
applies to or purports to apply to the Offer, the Merger, the Tender and
Voting Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

4.28 _ Dataroom, CRM Database_. The documents published on or before April
11, 2006 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific time by the Company in the IntraLinks dataroom
to which Parent has been given access, as recorded in the DVD copy of such
dataroom furnished by the Company to Parent, are true and complete copies of
the documents they purport to disclose, and have not been amended,
supplemented, superseded or terminated except as is set forth by other
documents published in such dataroom on or before such date. Without
limitation, the such dataroom includes copies of all Material Contracts
except that certain customer contracts which are Material Contracts only
because of their associated sales volume (and not because they are a type of
contract described in Sections 4.11(a)(ii)-(ix) hereof) may instead be
located in the portions of the Companys Siebel CRM database to which Parents
representatives have been given access. All such Material Contracts in such
CRM database are true and complete copies of the documents they purport to
disclose, and have not been amended, supplemented, superseded or terminated
except as is set forth by other documents which appear in a search for the
base document.

4.29 _ No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in this _Article IV_ , neither the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries nor any other Person makes any express or
implied representation or warranty on behalf of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, and the Company disclaims any such representation or warranty,
whether by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives or any
other Person.

7.3_, in the event that Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent,
shall acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the issued and outstanding
Company Shares pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the  



 

36  Company shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger
to become effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without
a meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253
of the DGCL.

7.4 _ Proxy Statement_.

(a) If approval of the Company Stockholders is required by Delaware Law in
order to consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section 253 of the
DGCL, as soon as practicable following the Appointment Time, the Company and
Parent shall jointly prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, the
Proxy Statement for use in connection with the solicitation of proxies from
the Company Stockholders in connection with the Merger and the Company
Stockholders Meeting. The Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall
furnish all information concerning the Company or Parent as the other party
hereto may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing
with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. Subject to all applicable Legal
Requirements, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as
promptly as practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC. No filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Proxy Statement shall be made by the Company without
providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. The
Company shall advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any
request by the SEC or its staff for an amendment or revisions to the Proxy
Statement, or comments thereon and responses thereto, or requests by the SEC
or its staff for additional information in connection therewith. If at any
time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating
to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective directors, officers or
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party or parties
hereto, as the case may be, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement describing such information shall be promptly prepared and
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The Company
shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form and substance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
any applicable rules of the Nasdaq.

(b) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article IX_
hereof, subject to the terms of _Section 7.2(b)_ hereof, the Company shall
include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation (other than
with respect to the Offer).

7.5 _ Commercially Reasonable Efforts to Complete_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties
hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), including using commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) cause the
conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex A_ hereto and the conditions to
the Merger set forth in _Article VIII_ hereof to be satisfied or fulfilled;
(ii) obtain all necessary or appropriate consents, waivers and approvals under
any Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) so as to maintain and
preserve the benefits under such Contracts following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) without
any requirement that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries incur any cost or
obligation to suffer the loss of any right in connection therewith; (iii)
resolve, prior to the initial expiration of the Offer, any issues which have
or may emerge from industry-  



 

37  standard scans of the Companys software code (it being understood and
hereby agreed that (A) the resolution of such issues, whether prior to
or following the initial expiration of the Offer, shall not be a condition to
the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer or the Merger), and (B) the failure to resolve any such
issues prior to the initial expiration of the Offer shall not be deemed to be
a Company Material Adverse Effect); (iv) obtain all necessary actions or non-
actions, waivers, consents, approvals, Orders and authorizations from
Governmental Entities, the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting periods, making all necessary registrations, declarations and filings
(including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities,
if any) and (v) execute or deliver any additional instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry
out the purposes of, this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section
7.5(a)_ hereof, as soon as may be reasonably practicable following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company
shall file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification
and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) as required by the HSR Act, as
well as comparable pre-merger notification filings, forms and submissions
with any foreign Governmental Entity that may be required by the merger
notification or control laws and regulations of any applicable foreign
jurisdiction or be deemed desirable by Parent, in each case as Parent may
deem necessary and/or appropriate. Each of Parent and the Company shall
promptly (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of such
filings, (ii) supply the other with any information that may be required in
order to effectuate such filings and (iii) supply any additional information
that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the
competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and
that Parent reasonably deems necessary and/or appropriate. Each party hereto
shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be,
of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger). If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger), then such party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section
7.5(a)_ hereof, in the event that any state anti-takeover or other similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company Board, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.5_, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent shall be obligated to accept or agree
to anything that, in Parents reasonable judgment, would be expected to
directly or indirectly have any of the effects set forth in condition (1) of
_Annex A_.

7.6 _ Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Appointment

other representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the
Company to enable Parent to obtain all information concerning the business,
including the status of product development efforts, properties, results
of operations and personnel of the Company, as Parent may reasonably request;
_provided, however_ , that no information or Knowledge obtained by Parent in
any investigation conducted pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ shall affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth
herein or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the  



 

38  transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the
remedies available to the parties hereunder; and _provided further_ ,
that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to
any information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.6_.

7.7 _ Notification_.

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Appointment Time, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent upon becoming aware that any
representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement has become untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of the Company to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of the Company set forth herein or the conditions
to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the remedies
available to the parties hereunder; and _provided further_ , that the terms
and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any
information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.7(a)_.

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Appointment Time, Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that any
representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub in this Agreement has
become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of
Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set
forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder and _provided
further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement

shall not settle any such stockholder litigation without the prior written
consent of Parent.

acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed a
Confidentiality Agreement, dated July 25, 2005 (as amended, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which will continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

7.10 _ Public Disclosure_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall consult
with each other, and to the extent practicable, agree, before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger) or any Acquisition Proposal, and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by applicable Legal Requirements or any listing agreement
with a national securities exchange, in which case commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other party hereto shall be made prior to any such
release or public statement.

7.11 _ Company Options; Company ESPP_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Oracle Corporation to assume each
Company Option that is outstanding immediately  



 

39  prior to the Effective Time (each, an " _Assumed Company Option_ "). Each
Assumed Company Option shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same
material terms and conditions of such Assumed Company Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions),
except that (A) each Assumed Company Option shall be exercisable (or will
become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole
shares of Oracle Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon
exercise of such Assumed Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time (not taking into account any restrictions on exercise or vesting) and (y)
the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the Merger Consideration by (2) the
average of the closing prices of one (1) share of Oracle Common Stock, as
quoted on Nasdaq for the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Oracle Common Stock and (B) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Oracle Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
such Assumed Company Option (not taking into account any restrictions on
exercise or vesting) shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1)
the exercise price per share of such Assumed Company Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (2) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent. Parent shall cause Oracle Corporation to comply with the terms of
all such Assumed Company Options and use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions of, the
Company Option Plans and permitted under the Code that any and all Assumed
Company Options that qualified as "incentive stock options" as defined in
Section 422 of the Code prior to the Effective Time continue to so qualify
after the Effective Time. Parent shall cause Oracle Corporation to take all
corporate actions necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Oracle Common Stock for delivery pursuant to the terms set forth in
this _Section 7.11(b)_. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause Oracle Corporation to deliver to each person who
holds an Assumed Company Option a document evidencing the assumption of such
Assumed Company Option by Oracle Corporation pursuant to the terms of this
_Section 7.11(a)_. 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and conditional upon the Closing, the Company (and the Company
Board) shall take all requisite actions and/or adopt such resolutions as may
be required in order to give effect to and accomplish the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 7.12_, including by amending each of the
Company Option Plans (i) if and to the extent necessary and practicable, to
reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer
and the Merger) and (ii) to preclude any discretionary, automatic or
formulaic grant of any Company Options or other equity-based awards thereunder
on or after the date hereof except as permitted pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)_
hereof.

(c) The Company shall terminate the Company ESPP at least ten (10) days prior
to the Effective Time, under the terms of such Company ESPP. The Company
shall provide Parent evidence that the Company ESPP has been terminated
pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or the board of directors of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable (the form and substance of which resolutions shall
be subject to review and approval of Parent).

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and conditional upon the Closing, Parent shall cause Oracle
Corporation (and its board of directors or authorized committee thereof) to
take all requisite actions and/or adopt such resolutions necessary to
authorize Oracle Corporation to assume all of the Assumed Company Options
pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 7.11(a)_ hereof. At or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Oracle Corporation to take all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Oracle Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Assumed Stock
Options. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause Oracle Corporation to make available to the holders of Assumed
Company Options appropriate documents setting forth such holders rights
pursuant to the Assumed Company Options. As soon as is reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Oracle Corporation to file,
if available for use by Oracle Corporation, a registration statement on Form
S-8 to register the shares of Oracle Common Stock issuable upon the exercise
of all Assumed Company Options.



 

40 7.12 _ Employee Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall permit all Continuing
Employees who become employees of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to
participate in the benefit programs of Parent or the Subsidiary to the same
extent as similarly situated employees of Parent or the Subsidiary. In the
U.S., Continuing Employees who become employees of Parent shall be given
credit for all service with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of
determining their eligibility and rate of benefit accrual under Parents
benefit plans, and for eligibility to participate in, and vesting of benefits
under, Parents 401(k) plan. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
subject to the terms and conditions of the benefit contracts between Parent
and its benefit providers and insurance carriers, (i) cause any pre-existing
conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any U.S.
group health plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries to be waived with respect to
the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents and (ii) give each of
the Continuing Employee in the U.S. credit for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs toward applicable deductibles and annual out of pocket
limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has
been made. Each U.S. Continuing Employee shall be paid by the Company in cash
for any accrued and unused vacation days as of the Effective Time under the
plans and policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(b) Effective immediately preceding the Effective Time, the Company will
terminate any and all Employee Plans intended to qualify as a qualified cash
or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code and, at the request
of Parent, the Company will provide Parent with evidence that such Employee
Plans have been terminated effective immediately prior to the Closing pursuant
to resolutions duly adopted by the Company Board; _provided, however,_  that
effective as soon as practicable after the Continuing Employees commence
employment with Oracle USA, Inc. or other affiliate of Parent (other than the
Company), such employer shall have in effect such a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code that is no less favorable than
such Employee Plans so terminated in which the Continuing Employees shall be
eligible to participate. In addition, at the request of Parent, the Company
will terminate any and all other Employee Plans, including any group health,
dental, severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or
arrangements, effective either immediately prior to the Effective Time or
thereafter as specified by Parent and, at the request of Parent, the Company
will provide Parent with evidence that such Employee Plans have been so
terminated pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by the Company Board. The
Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating
such Employee Plans as Parent may reasonably require.

7.13 _ Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements in effect immediately prior to the Appointment Time
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Appointment
Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition, for a period of six (6)
years following the Effective Time, Parent shall (and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification and exculpation that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Appointment Time,
and during such six (6) year period, such provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any respect, except as required by Legal
Requirements.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Appointment Time, covering
each person covered by the DandO Insurance immediately prior to the Appointment
Time, on terms with respect to the coverage and  



 

41  amounts that are equivalent to those of the DandO Insurance; _provided,
however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, at its option, (i) substitute
therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage and amounts
that are equivalent to those of the DandO Insurance or (ii) request that the
Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing
insurance program (to be effective as of the Effective Time), _provided
further, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this _Section
7.13(b)_ Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay
annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid
by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such three hundred
percent (300%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ") (which premiums the
Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in _Section 7.13_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule), provided that that if the annual premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the
Appointment Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the
DandO Insurance on terms and conditions that are equivalent to those of the DandO
Insurance. In the event that the Company shall purchase such a "tail" policy
prior to the Appointment Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor
their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section
7.13(b)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force
and effect. 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume
all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in
this _Section 7.13_.

(d) The obligations under this _Section 7.13_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.13(b)_ hereof (and
their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such
affected Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.13(b)_ hereof (and
their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or other
persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy
referred to in _Section 7.13(b)_ hereof (and their heirs and representatives)
are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.13_, with
full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the
Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.13(b)_ hereof (and
their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section 7.13_ shall be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons
may have under the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other
equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of
or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Legal
Requirements (whether at law or in equity).

 

(e) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries under this  _Section 7.13_ shall be joint and
several.

7.14 _ Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary
to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

shall survive the termination of this Agreement and (b) that nothing herein
shall relieve any party or parties hereto, as applicable, from liability for
any willful breach of, or fraud in connection with, this Agreement. In

precedent to the Companys obligation to make such payment as set forth in
this _Section 9.4(b)_, in the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by
Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ hereof  



 

45  or by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)(i)_ hereof (other than, with
reference to _Section 9.1(e)(i)_, on account of one or more representations
or warranties that were accurate when made and became inaccurate at a later
time other than as a result of any action taken or consented to by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries), (B) following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ hereof, or prior to the breach or

Agreement, either a Company Acquisition Transaction (whether or not the one
referenced in the preceding clause (B)) is consummated or the Company enters
into a letter of intent or Contract providing for an Company Acquisition
Transaction (whether or not the one referenced in the preceding clause (B))
and such transaction is subsequently consummated. For purposes of this
_Section 9.4(b)_, the term "Company Acquisition Transaction" shall have the
same meaning as the term "Acquisition Transaction" except that (i) all
references to fifteen (15%) shall be deemed to be "a majority" for purposes of
this definition of a "Company Acquisition Transaction" and (ii) the reference
to eighty five percent (85%)" therein shall be deemed to be "a majority" for
purposes of this definition of a "Company Acquisition Transaction."

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.1(d)(ii)_, prior and as a condition to the effectiveness of such
termination, the Company shall pay to Parent a fee equal to the Termination
Fee Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or

_Section 9.1(e)(ii)_ hereof, the Company shall pay to Parent a fee equal to
the Termination Fee Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

(c) _Enforcement_. Parent and the Company acknowledge and hereby agree that
the provisions of _Section 9.4(b)_ hereof are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), and that, if such payment is accepted by Parent, such payment would
constitute liquidated damages.

9.5 _ Amendment_. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements and subject to
the other provisions of this Agreement (including _Section 2.3(c)_ hereof),
this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution
of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company; _provided, however_ , that in the event that this Agreement has
been adopted by the Company Stockholders in accordance with Delaware Law, no
amendment shall be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of such
Company Stockholders without such approval.

9.6 _ Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed
and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or
parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or
parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or
parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties,
as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of such right.
