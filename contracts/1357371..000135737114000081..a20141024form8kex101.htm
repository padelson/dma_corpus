or other liabilities of Antares retained under this Agreement;

(e) rights to initiate and conduct joint interest audits or other audits of

generally, as reflected in Schedule 1.3(f);

(g) all trade credits, account receivables, note receivables, take-or-pay
amounts receivable, and other receivables, and all other accounts, instruments
and general intangibles (as such terms are defined in the Texas Uniform

(m) Assets retained by Antares or excluded from the Assets pursuant to Section

Section 1.4 Effective Time; Proration of Costs and Revenues.

(a) Possession of the Assets shall be transferred from Antares to Breitburn on
the date hereof, but certain financial benefits and obligations of the Assets
shall be transferred effective as of 7:00 A.M., local time, on October 1, 2014
where the respective Assets are located (the "Effective Time"), as further set
forth in this Agreement. 

(b) Except to the extent accounted for in the adjustments to the Consideration
made under Section 2.2, (i) Breitburn shall be entitled to all production from
or attributable to the Properties at and after the Effective Time (and all
products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income,
proceeds, receipts and credits (excluding the Adjusted Consideration and all
other consideration due to Antares hereunder) earned with respect to the
Assets at or after the Effective Time, and (ii) Antares shall be entitled to
all production from or attributable to the Properties prior to the Effective
Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other
income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets prior
to the Effective Time. "Earned" and "incurred", as used in this Agreement,
shall be interpreted in accordance with GAAP and Council of Petroleum
Accountants Society ("COPAS") standards, as applied by Antares in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice. For purposes of allocating
production (and accounts receivable with respect thereto), under this Section
1.4(b), (i) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable
to" the Leases, Units and Wells when they pass through the pipeline connecting
into the storage facilities into which they are transported from the lands
covered by the applicable Lease, Unit or Well, or if there are no storage
facilities, when they pass through the LACT meter or similar meter at the
entry point into the pipelines through which they are transported from such
lands and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or
attributable to" the Leases, Units and Wells when they pass through the
delivery point sales meters or similar meters at the entry point into the
pipelines through which they are transported from such lands. Antares shall
utilize reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation of
production when exact meter readings (including gas production meters or sales
meters) or gauging and strapping data is not available.

(c) As used herein, "Property Costs" means (i) all costs attributable to the
ownership or operation of the Assets (including prepaid costs or deposits,
costs of insurance, and ad valorem, property, severance, production and
similar Taxes based upon or measured by the ownership or operation of the
Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons therefrom, but excluding any other
Taxes), (ii) capital expenditures incurred in the ownership or operation of
the Assets in the ordinary course of business, (iii) where applicable, such
costs and capital expenditures charged in accordance with the relevant
operating agreement, unit agreement, pooling agreement, pre-pooling agreement,
pooling order or similar instrument, or if none, charged to the Assets on the
same basis as charged on the date of this Agreement, and (iv) overhead costs
charged to the Assets under the relevant operating agreement, unit agreement,
pooling agreement, pre-pooling agreement, pooling order or similar instrument
by unaffiliated third parties, or if none, charged to the Assets on the same
basis as charged on the date of this Agreement; provided that "Property Costs"
shall exclude, without limitation, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses
attributable to (i) claims, investigations, Proceedings or litigation directly
or indirectly arising out of or resulting from actual or claimed personal
injury or death, property damage or violation of any Law (including private
rights or causes of action under any Law), (ii) title claims (including claims
that the Leases have terminated), (iii) obligations to plug wells, dismantle
facilities, close pits and restore the surface or seabed around such wells,
facilities and pits, (iv) obligations to cure, address or remediate any
contamination of groundwater, surface water, soil or Equipment under
applicable 

Environmental Laws, (v) obligations to furnish make-up gas according to the
terms of applicable gas sales, gathering or transportation contracts, (vi) gas
balancing obligations and similar obligations arising from Imbalances, (vii)
claims for improper calculation or payment of royalties, overriding royalties
or similar burdens based on the deduction of post-production costs or the use
of prices received by Antares or a particular reference price, and (viii)
obligations to pay working interests, royalties, overriding royalties or other
interests held in suspense, all of which are addressed in Section 11.2 or
elsewhere in this Agreement. For the purposes of calculating the adjustments
to the Consideration under Section 2.2 or implementing the terms of Section
7.7 or Article 11, ad valorem, property and similar Taxes, right-of-way fees,
insurance premiums and Property Costs (excluding delay rentals, lease bonuses,
minimum royalties, option payments, lease extension payments and shut-in
royalties) that are paid periodically shall be prorated based on the number of
days in the applicable period falling before, or at and after, the Effective
Time, except that production, severance and similar Taxes shall be prorated
based on the number of units actually produced, purchased or sold or proceeds
of sale, as applicable, before, or at and after, the Effective Time. Subject
to the preceding sentence, determination of whether Property Costs are
attributable to the period before or after the Effective Time shall be based
on when services are rendered, when goods are delivered, or when the work is
performed.

Section 1.5 Delivery and Maintenance of Records.

(a) Antares, at Breitburn's cost, shall deliver the Records to Breitburn
within three (3) Business Days following the date hereof. Antares may retain
copies of any Records that it needs for litigation, tax, accounting, and
auditing purposes and may use them for only those purposes.

ARTICLE 2

CONSIDERATION

Section 2.1 Consideration.

The consideration for the Assets (the "Consideration") shall consist of (i)
Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) (the "Cash Consideration") and (ii) Four
Million Three Hundred Thousand (4,300,000) common units, each representing a
limited partner interest (the "Common Units") in the Parent (the "Unit
Consideration"); provided, however, that the Cash Consideration portion of the
Consideration shall be adjusted as provided in Section 2.2 and Section 9.3
(the "Adjusted Consideration").

Section 2.2 Adjustments to Consideration.

The Cash Consideration for the Assets shall be adjusted as follows with all
such amounts being determined in accordance with GAAP and COPAS standards, as
applied by Antares in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice (with such adjustments being made so as to not give duplicative
effect): 

(a) Reduced by the aggregate amount of the following proceeds received and
retained by Antares between the Effective Time and the date hereof (with the
period between the Effective Time and the date hereof referred to as the
"Adjustment Period"): proceeds earned from the sale of Hydrocarbons (net of
any royalties, overriding royalties or other burdens on or payable out of
production, gathering, processing and transportation costs and any production,
severance, sales, excise or similar Taxes not reimbursed to Antares by the
purchaser of production) produced from or attributable to the Properties after
the Effective Time;

(b) Reduced in accordance with Section 3.5 or Section 7.6, by an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of those Properties (i) with respect to which
preferential purchase rights have been exercised on or prior to the date
hereof, or (ii) that cannot be transferred due to unsatisfied and unwaived
Consent Requirements;

(c) Reduced in accordance with Section 7.6 by an amount equal to the Allocated
Value of those Properties that are subject to a Proceeding on or prior to the
date hereof seeking to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a claim to enforce
preferential rights;

(d) Increased by the amount equal to the value of all of Antares's inventories
of Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the Properties that are in
storage in tanks or pipelines above the load line or pipeline connection, as
applicable, as of the Effective Time (which value shall be computed using the
realized price at which time the Hydrocarbons are sold), less any applicable
production, severance, sales or excise Taxes, overriding royalties, royalties
and similar burdens on or payable out of production; provided, however, that
the adjustment contemplated by this paragraph shall be only made to the extent
that Antares does not receive and retain the proceeds, or portion thereof,
attributable to the sale of such Hydrocarbons;

(e) Increased by the amount of all Property Costs and other costs attributable
to the ownership and operation of the Assets that are paid by Antares and
incurred on or after the Effective Time, including pre-paid costs and
deposits, except any Property Costs and other such costs already deducted in
the determination of proceeds in Section 2.2(a); and

(f) Decreased in accordance with Section 7.9, as applicable.

The adjustment described in Section 2.2(a) shall serve to satisfy, up to the
amount of the adjustment, Breitburn's entitlement under Section 1.4 to
Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to the Properties during the
Adjustment Period, and to the value of other income, proceeds, receipts and
credits earned with respect to the Assets during the Adjustment Period, and
Breitburn shall not have any separate rights to receive any production or
income, proceeds, receipts and credits with respect to which an adjustment has
been made. No amount shall be charged to Breitburn, on the date hereof or in
the Final Settlement, for the net profits overriding royalty interest or
amounts related thereto that are owed to Macquarie Americas Corp. or any of
its Affiliates for the period between the Effective Time and the Closing Date. 

Section 2.3 Allocation of Consideration.

Within thirty (30) days after the date hereof, Breitburn and Antares will
agree upon an allocation of the unadjusted Consideration among each of the
Assets, in compliance with the principles of Section 1060 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the United States Treasury
Regulations thereunder. Such allocation shall be consistent with the Allocated
Values set forth in Schedule 2.3. The "Allocated Value" for any Asset equals
the portion of the unadjusted Consideration allocated to such Asset on
Schedule 2.3, increased or decreased as described in Section 2.2. Any
adjustments to the Consideration other than the adjustments provided for in
Sections 2.2(b) and 2.2(c) shall be applied on a pro rata basis in proportion
to the amounts set forth on Schedule 2.3 for all Assets. After all such
adjustments are made, any adjustments to the Consideration pursuant to
Sections 2.2(b) and 2.2(c) shall be applied to the amounts set forth in
Schedule 2.3 for the particular affected Assets. After Antares and Breitburn
have agreed on the Allocated Values for the Assets, the Parties will be deemed
to have accepted such Allocated Values for purposes of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, but Antares makes no representation or
warranty as to the accuracy of such values. Antares and Breitburn agree (i)
that the Allocated Values, as adjusted pursuant to this paragraph, shall be
used by Antares and Breitburn as the basis for reporting asset values and
other items for purposes of all federal, state, and local Tax Returns,
including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and (ii) that neither they nor
their Affiliates will take positions inconsistent with the Allocated Values
(as adjusted pursuant to this paragraph) in notices to Governmental Bodies, in
audit or other Proceedings with respect to Taxes, in notices to preferential
purchase right holders, or in other documents or notices relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the consent of the other
Party. Breitburn and Antares further agree that, on or immediately after the
date hereof, they will mutually agree as to the further allocation of the
Allocated Values included in Schedule 2.3 as to the relative portion of those
values attributable to leasehold costs and depreciable equipment.

Section 3.4 Intentionally Omitted.

Section 3.5 Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase.

Antares shall use commercially reasonable efforts (provided Antares shall not
be required to expend out of pocket costs payable to third Persons) to request
and obtain (i) all necessary consents to assignment of the Assets (excluding
Governmental Bodies, which are addressed elsewhere in this Agreement) and (ii)
all waivers of applicable preferential rights to purchase any Asset, in each
case that would be triggered by the Contribution and Consideration
contemplated by this Agreement, and of which Antares has knowledge as set
forth on Schedule 5.15 (such consents and preferential rights, "Preferential
Rights and Consents"). The consideration payable under this Agreement for any
particular Assets for purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall be
the Allocated Value for such Assets (proportionately reduced if an Asset is
only partially affected). Breitburn shall cooperate with Antares in seeking to
satisfy or obtain waivers of, as applicable, such Preferential Rights and
Consents.

(a) Consents. On the date hereof, Antares has notified Breitburn of all
Preferential Rights and Consents that have not been waived or granted, as
applicable, or that have been exercised in the case of preferential rights to
purchase, and the Assets to which they pertain. In no event shall there be
included in the Conveyances on the date hereof any Asset subject to an
unsatisfied consent requirement that would be triggered by the Contribution
and Consideration contemplated by this Agreement and provides that transfer of
the Asset without consent will result in (i) a termination or other material
impairment of any existing rights in relation to such Asset or (ii) the
payment of liquidated damages absent the consent (such consent requirement, a
"Consent Requirement"). In cases where the Asset subject to a Consent
Requirement is a Contract and Breitburn is assigned the Properties to which
the Contract relates, but the Contract is not transferred to Breitburn due to
the unwaived Consent Requirement, Antares shall continue after the date hereof
to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the applicable consent so
that Antares's right, title and interest in such Contract can be transferred
to Breitburn upon the receipt of such consent. In cases where the Asset
subject to a Consent Requirement is a Property and the third Person consent to
the sale and transfer of such Property has not been obtained on or prior to
the date hereof, (i) the affected Property shall be excluded from the Assets
for purposes of the Conveyance delivered herewith unless and until the Consent
Requirement is waived or satisfied before the Final Settlement Date (unless
otherwise agreed by Antares and Breitburn), (ii) there shall be a downward
adjustment to the Consideration equal to the Allocated Value of the 

affected Property, and (iii) the Parties shall otherwise account to each other
under Section 2.2 and Section 2.3 to reflect the exclusion of the Property in
the preliminary settlement statement delivered under Section 9.3(a). In cases
where an Asset is subject to a third Person consent requirement that is not a
Consent Requirement, the Asset shall be included in the Assets on the date
hereof (unless excluded pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement)
and Breitburn (with Antares's reasonable cooperation) shall be responsible
after the date hereof for satisfying such consent requirement at its sole
cost, risk and expense, to the extent the applicable consent was not obtained
or waived on or prior to the date hereof. If an unsatisfied Consent
Requirement for which a Consideration adjustment is made in the preliminary
settlement statement is subsequently satisfied prior to the date of the final
determination of the Final Settlement Statement (the "Final Settlement Date"),
Antares shall receive an additional upward adjustment to the Consideration
equal to the amount of the previous reduction in the Consideration on account
of the Consent Requirement and the provisions of this Section 3.5 shall no
longer apply except for the assignment made under the next sentence. Within
five (5) Business Days of the satisfaction or waiver of any such Consent
Requirement, or at another mutually agreed time, (i) Breitburn shall pay to
Antares the amount of the upward adjustment described in the preceding
sentence in cash by wire transfer, (ii) Antares shall assign to Breitburn
using substantially the same form as the Conveyance, to the extent previously
unassigned, each Property subject to an aforementioned Consent Requirement
that was subsequently satisfied after the date hereof but prior to the Final
Settlement Date, and (iii) the Parties shall otherwise account to one another
under Section 2.2 and Section 2.3 in the Final Settlement Statement to reflect
the inclusion of the Property in the Assets (but taking into account the prior
payment made under clause (i) of this sentence).

(b) Exercised Preferential Rights to Purchase. If any preferential right to
purchase any Property that would be triggered by the Contribution and
Consideration contemplated by this Agreement was exercised on or prior to the
date hereof, such Property transferred to the exercising third Person as a
result of the exercise of such preferential right shall be excluded from the
Assets for all purposes hereunder, and the Consideration shall be reduced
under Section 2.2(b) by the Allocated Value for such Property (proportionately
reduced if the preferential right affects only a portion of such Property).
Antares shall retain the consideration paid by the third Person pursuant to
the exercise of such preferential right. If any preferential right to purchase
any Asset is not exercised and has not expired prior to the date hereof, then
the terms of Section 7.6 shall apply to such right.

Section 3.6 Limitations on Applicability.

CONVEYANCE (SUBJECT TO SECTION 7.8), BREITBURN, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND THE

BREITBURN OR ANY BREITBURN INDEMNITEE MIGHT NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY MAY HAVE,

(ii) Antares is an "accredited investor" (as such term is used in Rule 501
under the Securities Act), is able to bear the economic risk of its investment
in the Common Units indefinitely and has sufficient net worth to sustain a
loss of its entire investment in Parent without economic hardship if such loss
should occur. 

(b) Access to Information.

Antares has not received representations or warranties from Parent or
Breitburn, or their employees, affiliates, attorneys, accountants or agents,
except as set forth in this Agreement, and has undertaken such due diligence
pertaining to Parent and Breitburn as Antares deems adequate.

(c) Investment Purposes.

(i) Antares is acquiring the Common Units solely for investment for its own
account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with the view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in any transaction in violation of
the federal or state securities laws. Antares will hold the Common Units for
its own account for investment and not with a view to, or for sale or other
disposition in connection with, any distribution of all or any part thereof
within the meaning of the Securities Act, except in compliance with applicable
federal and state securities Laws. Antares understands that the Common Units
have not been registered under the Securities Act or applicable state
securities laws by reason of a specific exemption from the registration
provisions of the Securities Act and applicable state securities Laws, the
availability of which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature
of the investment intent and the accuracy of Antares's representations as
expressed in Section 5.23(a). Antares understands that Parent is relying, in
part, upon the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.23(a) for
the purpose of determining whether this transaction meets the requirements for
such exemption.

(ii) Antares understands that on the date hereof the Common Units will be
characterized as "restricted securities" under federal securities Laws and
that under such Laws and applicable regulations the Common Units cannot be
sold or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or
an exemption therefrom.

Section 7.1 Access.

Prior to the date hereof, Breitburn acknowledges that it has been granted
access to the offices of Antares and the Records in Antares's possession or
control (subject to applicable confidentiality restrictions that prohibited
disclosure) for the purpose of conducting its own investigation, at its sole
cost, risk and expense. All information obtained by and access granted to
Breitburn, its environmental consultant, and their respective agents,
employees and representatives under this Section shall be subject to the terms
of Section 7.5 and the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 7.2 Government Reviews.

Each Party shall in a timely manner (a) make all required filings, if any,
including filings required under the HSR Act, with and prepare applications to

filings, applications or negotiations are necessary or 

appropriate for such Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,

such Assets to Breitburn.

Section 7.4 Intentionally Omitted.

Section 7.5 Indemnity Regarding Access.

Breitburn, on behalf of itself and the Breitburn Indemnitees, hereby releases
and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless all Antares Indemnitees and
the other owners of interests in the leases and wells described on Exhibit A
or Exhibit A-1 from and against any and all Damages, including claims,
liabilities, losses, costs and expenses attributable to personal injuries,
death, or property damage, arising out of or relating to any and all access by
the Breitburn Indemnitees or any of its environmental consultants to Antares's
offices, the Assets or the Records (or other related information), or any
related activities of the Breitburn Indemnitees prior to the date hereof, EVEN
IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR
CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY
EXCLUDING, HOWEVER, ANY CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES CAUSED
BY THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

Section 7.6 Other Preferential Rights.

Should a third Person fail to exercise its preferential right to purchase as
to any portion of the Assets on or prior to the date hereof and the time for
exercise or waiver has not yet expired, subject to the remaining provisions of
this Section 7.6, such Assets shall be included in the transaction and
Conveyance on the date hereof, such preferential right to purchase shall be a
Permitted Encumbrance hereunder, and the following procedures shall be
applicable. If one or more of the holders of any such preferential right to
purchase notifies Antares (or Breitburn) subsequent to the date hereof that it
intends to assert its preferential purchase right, Antares shall give notice
thereof to Breitburn, whereupon Breitburn shall satisfy all such preferential
Breitburn right obligations of Antares to such holders and shall indemnify and
hold harmless all Antares Indemnitees from and against any and all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses 

(including court costs, expert fees and reasonable attorney's fees) in
connection therewith, and Breitburn shall be entitled to receive (and Antares
hereby assigns to Breitburn all of Antares's rights to) all proceeds, received
from such holders in connection with such preferential rights to purchase.

If prior to or on the date hereof, any third Person has brought any Proceeding
seeking to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a claim to enforce
preferential rights, the Assets or portion thereof subject to such Proceeding
shall be excluded from the Assets transferred in the Conveyance and the
Consideration shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such excluded Assets
or portions thereof. Promptly after the Proceeding is dismissed or settled or
a judgment is rendered in favor of Antares, as applicable, Breitburn shall
have the option to purchase from Antares within thirty (30) days after receipt
of notice from Antares of such dismissal, settlement or judgment, all such
Assets or portions thereof not being sold to the third Person for a
Consideration equal to the Allocated Value of such Assets or portions thereof,
and the Parties shall account to each other under Section 2.2 and Section 2.3.

Section 7.7 Tax Matters.

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 12.3, Antares shall be responsible
for all ad valorem, real property, personal property, severance, production
and similar Taxes based upon or measured by the ownership or operation of the
Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons therefrom ("Property Taxes") that are
attributable to any period of time at or prior to Effective Time. Breitburn
shall be responsible for all Property Taxes that are attributable to any
period of time after the Effective Time. For purposes of this Section 7.7(a),
ad valorem and real property Taxes assessed for a particular time period shall
be deemed "attributable" to such time period, even if such assessment is
valued based upon production or other data for prior Tax periods. Regardless
of which Party is responsible, Antares shall handle payment to the appropriate
Governmental Body of all Property Taxes affecting the ownership or operation
of the Assets which are required to be paid prior to date hereof (and shall
file all Tax Returns with respect to such Property Taxes), and Breitburn shall
handle payment to the appropriate Governmental Body of all Taxes affecting the
ownership or operation of the Assets which are required to be paid after date
hereof (and shall file all Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 7.7(a) shall not apply to income,
franchise, corporate, business and occupation, business license and similar
Taxes, and Tax Returns therefor, which shall be borne, paid and filed by the
Party responsible for such Taxes under applicable Law. If requested by
Breitburn, Antares will assist Breitburn with preparation of all Property Tax
Returns due on or before thirty (30) days after the date hereof (including any
extensions requested). Antares shall deliver to Breitburn within thirty (30)
days of filing copies of all Tax Returns filed by Antares after the date
hereof affecting the Assets and any supporting documentation provided by
Antares to Governmental Bodies.

(b) If Antares or Breitburn (or an Affiliate of Antares or Breitburn) receives
a refund of any Taxes (whether by payment, credit offset or otherwise, with
any interest thereon) covered by Section 7.7(a) that are paid by and required
to be borne by the other Party, the Party that received (or whose Affiliate
that received) such refund shall 

promptly (but no later than thirty (30) days after receipt) remit payment to
such other Party of an amount equal to the refund amount, including all
relevant documentation. Each Party shall cooperate with the other and its
Affiliates in order to take all reasonably necessary steps to claim any refund
to which it is entitled. Breitburn agrees to notify Antares within ten (10)
days following the discovery of a right to claim any refund to which Antares
is entitled and upon receipt of any such refund. Except to the extent required
by applicable Laws, Breitburn shall not and shall not permit its Affiliates to
amend any Tax Returns with respect to Taxes for which Antares is liable under
this Section 7.7 or for which Antares may be liable to indemnify Breitburn
under Section 11.2.

(c) Control of any legal or administrative Proceedings concerning any Property
Taxes affecting the Assets shall belong to the Party responsible for such
Property Taxes under this Section 7.7.

(d) Breitburn agrees to cooperate with Antares so that Antares's transfer of
the Assets to Breitburn shall, at Antares's election, be accomplished in a
manner enabling the transfer of all or part of the Assets to qualify as a part
of a like-kind exchange of property by Antares within the meaning of Section
1031 of the Code. If Antares so elects, Breitburn shall reasonably cooperate
with Antares to effect such like-kind exchange, which cooperation shall
include taking such actions as Antares reasonably requests in order to pay the
Consideration in a manner which enables such transfer to qualify as part of a
like-kind exchange of property within the meaning of Section 1031 of the Code,
and Breitburn agrees that Antares may assign all or a portion of its rights
(but not its obligations) under this Agreement to an escrow agent acting as a
qualified intermediary under United States Treasury Regulations, to qualify
the transfer of the Consideration as a part of a like-kind exchange of
property within the meaning of Section 1031 of the Code.

(e) The Parties acknowledge and agree that Antares's transfer of the Assets
pursuant to this Agreement to Breitburn is intended to be treated in part as a
contribution to Parent pursuant to Section 721 of the Code and in part as a
sale pursuant to Section 707 of the Code, and for purposes of determining the
portion of the Consideration treated as sale consideration and the portion of
the Assets treated as being sold for purposes of Section 707 of the Code, the
Parties agree to treat and report for United States federal income Tax
purposes (and state, local, and foreign Tax purposes where applicable) a
portion of the Cash Consideration as a reimbursement of "capital
expenditures," within the meaning of Treasury Regulations section 1.707-4(d),
to the extent Antares provides Breitburn with documentation prior to December
15, 2014 that is reasonably adequate to support such treatment and allow for
orderly preparation of tax calculations regarding the Assets (including
Antares's adjusted tax basis in the Assets and Antares's pre-formation capital
expenditures in respect of the Assets for the 24 months prior to the date
hereof). 

Section 7.8 Special Warranty of Title.

The Conveyance shall contain a covenant of Antares to warrant Defensible Title
to the Properties after the date hereof from and against the lawful claims of
third Persons arising by, through or under Antares, but not otherwise (the
"Special Warranty").

Section 7.9 Suspended Proceeds.

Antares shall transfer and remit to Breitburn, in the form of an adjustment to
the Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2(f), all monies representing the
value or proceeds of production removed or sold from the Properties and held
by Antares on the date hereof for accounts from which payment has been
suspended, such monies, net of applicable rights of set off or recoupment,
being hereinafter called "Suspended Proceeds". Breitburn shall be solely
responsible for the proper distribution of such Suspended Proceeds to the
Person or Persons which or who are entitled to receive payment of the same.

Section 7.10 Further Assurances.

After the date hereof, Antares and Breitburn each agree to take such further
actions and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further documents as
are reasonably requested by the other Party for carrying out the purposes of
this Agreement or of any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 7.11 Preparation and Audit of Financial Statements.

(a) For a period of one year after the date hereof ("Financial Statement
Period"), Antares agrees to prepare and deliver, at the sole cost and expense
of Breitburn, statements of revenues and direct operating expenses and all
notes thereto related to the Assets (the "Special Financial Statements") that
may be required of Parent by the SEC, including any notes required to be
prepared in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 932
"Extractive Activities Oil and Gas", in connection with any reports,
registration statements or other filings to be made by Parent or any of its
affiliates related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the
SEC pursuant to the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder,
or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and
the rules and regulations thereunder, in such form that such statements and
notes thereto can be audited by Antares's external audit firm ("Antares's
Auditor") and reviewed as may be required by Antares's external independent
petroleum reserve engineering firm ("Antares's Engineer"). If required, the
Special Financial Statements shall be prepared (i) as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2013 (the "Annual Special Financial Statements") and (ii)
as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014 (the "Interim
Special Financial Statements"). Antares shall cooperate with and permit
Breitburn to review and/or reasonably participate in the preparation of the
Special Financial Statements and shall provide Breitburn and its
representatives with reasonable access to Antares's personnel who engage in
the preparation of the Special Financial Statements. 

(b) If requested by Breitburn in connection with the Special Financial
Statements, Antares shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, to Antares's Auditor such representation letters, in form and
substance customary for representation letters provided to external audit
firms by Antares (if the financial statements are subject of an audit or are
the subject of a review pursuant to Statement of Accounting Standards 100
(Interim Financial Information)), as may be reasonably requested by Antares's
Auditor, with respect to the Special Financial Statements. Breitburn agrees
that (i) it shall indemnify and hold harmless Antares and provide a defense
for Antares (including, in each case, the negligence of Antares) with regard
to any action required to be undertaken by Antares pursuant to this Section
7.11, including without limitation the execution, delivery or any other action
related to the provision of (A) any representation letter delivered by Antares
to Antares's Auditor, (B) the Special Financial Statements, and (C) the Annual
Special Financial Statements, (ii) Breitburn shall provide a customary
representation letter to Antares's Auditor, if reasonably requested, and (iii)
Breitburn's and Parent\'s existing outside auditors shall provide a customary
representation letter to Antares's Auditor, if reasonably requested.

(c) If requested by Breitburn in connection with the Special Financial
Statements and at the sole cost and expense of Breitburn, Antares will engage
Antares's Auditor to perform an audit of the Annual Special Financial
Statements and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Antares's
Auditor to issue unqualified opinions with respect to the Annual Special
Financial Statements (the Annual Special Financial Statements and related
audit opinions being hereinafter referred to as the "Audited Special Financial
Statements"), and provide its written consent for the use of Antares's audit
reports with respect to the Audited Special Financial Statements in reports,
registration statements, or other documents filed by Parent or any of its
affiliates under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and the rules and
regulations thereunder, as needed. If requested by Breitburn in connection
with the Annual Special Financial Statements and at the sole cost and expense
of Breitburn, Antares will also cooperate with Breitburn to engage Antares's
Engineer as may be required in connection with the preparation of the Annual
Special Financial Statements and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause Antares's Engineer to provide its written consent for the use of
Antares's reserve reports with respect to the Audited Special Financial
Statements or disclosure of Antares's oil and gas reserves in reports,
registration statements, or other documents filed by Parent or any of its
affiliates under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and the rules and
regulations thereunder, as needed. Breitburn shall promptly reimburse Antares
for all fees charged by Antares's Auditor with respect to the preparation and
delivery by Antares's Auditor to Breitburn of the Audited Special Financial
Statements and any other fees charged by Antares's Auditor and Antares's
Engineer to facilitate Parent\'s ongoing compliance with SEC rules and

facilitate the completion of such audit and delivery of the Audited Special
Financial Statements and the delivery of the Interim Special Financial

or submit to the Independent Expert any amounts or adjustments that were not
contested in Breitburn's written report, which amounts or adjustments
Breitburn will be deemed to have accepted. If Breitburn does not timely
deliver such written report within such 30-day period, Breitburn shall be
deemed to agree with the adjustments set forth in Antares's statement. The
Parties shall undertake to agree on the final statement of the Adjusted
Consideration no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the date
hereof (such final statement, the "Final Settlement Statement"). In the event
that the Parties cannot agree on the Adjusted Consideration within one hundred
and fifty (150) days after the date hereof, the specific 

disputed items will be automatically referred to an independent expert of the
Parties' choosing with at least ten (10) years of oil and gas accounting
experience for arbitration (the "Independent Expert"). If the Parties are
unable to agree upon an Independent Expert, then such Independent Expert shall
be selected by any Federal District Court or State District Court Judge in
Houston, Texas. The Independent Expert shall conduct the arbitration
proceedings in Houston, Texas in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this Section. The Independent Expert's
determination shall be made within thirty (30) days after submission of the
matters in dispute and shall be final and binding on both Parties, without
right of appeal. In determining the proper amount of any adjustment to the
Consideration, the Independent Expert shall not increase the Consideration
more than the increase proposed by Antares nor decrease the Consideration more
than the decrease proposed by Breitburn, as applicable. The Independent Expert
shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific
disputed matters submitted by either Party and may not award damages or
penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Each Party shall each
bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case, and shall bear
one-half of the costs and expenses of the Independent Expert. Within ten (10)
days after the date on which the Parties agree (or are deemed to agree) on the
Final Settlement Statement or the Independent Expert finally determines the
disputed matters, as applicable, (i) Breitburn shall pay to Antares the amount
by which the Cash Consideration portion of the Adjusted Consideration exceeds
the Signing Payment or (ii) Antares shall pay to Breitburn the amount by which
the Signing Payment exceeds the Cash Consideration portion of the Adjusted
Consideration, as applicable. Any post-signing payment pursuant to this
Section 9.3 shall bear interest from the date hereof to the date of payment at
the Agreed Interest Rate.

(c) All payments made or to be made hereunder to Antares shall be in cash by
electronic transfer of immediately available funds to the account of Antares
pursuant to the wiring instructions reflected in Schedule 9.3(c) or as
separately provided in writing. All payments made or to be made hereunder to
Breitburn shall be in cash by electronic transfer of immediately available
funds to a bank and account specified by Breitburn in writing to Antares. 

Section 9.4 Delivery of Unit Consideration. On or before October 31, 2014,
Breitburn shall, or shall cause Parent to, deliver to Antares the Unit
Consideration in book entry to an account at American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company in the name of Antares.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
except for the rights of the Parties under Section 7.5, Section 7.10, and the
Special Warranty in the Conveyance (subject to Section 7.8), this Section 11.2
contains the Parties' exclusive remedy against each other with respect to (i)
breaches of this Agreement, including breaches of the representations and
warranties contained in Article 6 and Article 5, (ii) the covenants and
agreements that survive the execution of this Agreement pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, (iii) the ownership or operation of the Assets or the

entirety, it being acknowledged that the Parties shall not be entitled to a
rescission of this Agreement or to any further indemnification or other rights
or claims of any nature whatsoever in respect thereof, all of which the
Parties hereby waive.

(e) "Damages", for purposes of this Agreement, shall mean the amount of any
actual liability, loss, cost, diminution in value, expense, claim, demand,
notice of violation, investigation by any Governmental Body, administrative or
other Proceeding, payment, charge, obligation, fine, penalty, deficiency,
award or judgment incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Party arising out of
or resulting from the indemnified matter, including reasonable fees and
expenses of attorneys, consultants, accountants or other agents and experts
reasonably incident to matters indemnified against, and the costs of
investigation and/or monitoring of such matters, and the costs of enforcement
of the indemnity; provided, however, that no Antares or Breitburn Indemnitee
shall be entitled to indemnification under this Section 11.2 for Damages that
constitute (i) Damages that are waived or not recoverable under Section 12.18.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or a document to be
delivered hereto to the contrary, any claim for indemnity to which a Antares
Indemnitee or Breitburn Indemnitee is entitled must be asserted by and through

Section 11.3 Indemnification Actions.

All claims for indemnification under Section 11.2 shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this Article 11, the term "Indemnifying Party" when used
in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Party having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages
pursuant to this 

Article 11, and the term "Indemnified Party" when used in connection with
particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having the right to be
indemnified with respect to such Damages by another Party pursuant to this
Article 11, subject to Section 11.2(f).

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under Article 11, an Indemnified Party
shall notify the Indemnifying Party of its claim under this Section 11.3,
including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for
its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon a claim by a third Person against the
Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall provide
its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of
the Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served
with respect to the Third Party Claim; provided that the failure of any
Indemnified Party to give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided in this
Section 11.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under
Section 11.2 except to the extent such failure prejudices the Indemnifying
Party's ability to defend against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the
claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall
specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which was
inaccurate or breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have ten (10) Business Days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies
its liability to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim
at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party
is authorized, prior to and during such ten (10) Business Day period, to file
any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or
appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and
that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party all costs of which shall be
included as Damages in respect of such claim for indemnification. The failure
to provide notice to the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be denial of
liability.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third
Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense
and all related Proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof.
If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to
cooperate, at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party, in contesting any Third
Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified
Party may participate in, but not control, at its sole cost without any right
of reimbursement, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim
controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 11.3(d).
Irrespective of whether the Indemnified Party elects to participate in
contesting a Third Party Claim subject to this Section 11.3(d) in accordance
with the foregoing sentence, the Indemnifying Party at its sole cost and
expense shall provide to the Indemnified Party the following information with
respect to the Third Party Claim: all filings made by any party; all written
communications exchanged between any parties to the extent available to the
Indemnifying Party and not subject to a restriction on disclosure to the
Indemnified Party or potential waiver of attorney-client privilege in favor of
the Indemnifying Party or the 

Indemnified Party; and all orders, opinions, rulings or motions. The
Indemnifying Party shall deliver the foregoing items to the Indemnified Party
promptly after they become available to the Indemnifying Party. An
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (i)
settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect thereto which does not include a written release of the Indemnified
Party from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, or (ii) settle
any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified
Party, in each case except for any settlement made by the Indemnifying Party
in which the only consideration is the payment of money damages (or similar
consideration) and/or obligations undertaken by the Indemnifying Party and
which payment and/or undertaking would otherwise resolve all or a portion of
the Third Party Claim.

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability or admits its
liability but fails to diligently prosecute or settle the Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Third
Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with
counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing.

Section 11.4 Limitation on Actions.

(a) All representations and warranties of Antares and Breitburn contained

asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration or termination date.

(b) The indemnities in Sections 11.2(b)(iii) and 11.2(b)(iv) shall terminate
as of the termination date of each respective representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement that is subject to indemnification, except in each case
as to matters for which a specific written claim for indemnity has been
delivered to the Indemnifying Party on or before such termination date.
Breitburn's indemnities in Sections 7.5, 11.2(b)(i), 11.2(b)(ii) and
11.2(b)(v) shall continue without time limit. Antares's indemnities in Section

specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying
Party on or before such termination 

date. Antares's indemnity in Section 11.2(c)(iii)-(xii) shall continue without
time limit, subject however to applicable statutes of limitations.

Agreement, except for (i) claims for indemnification under Sections

Special Warranty, (iii) claims based on a breach of Antares's representation
in Section 5.6 or Section 5.8 or (iv) the adjustments to the Consideration
under Section 2.2 and any payments in respect thereof:

(i) Neither Party shall be required to indemnify any Person under Section
11.2(b)(iv) or 11.2(c) for any individual liability, loss, cost, expense,
claim, award or judgment that does not exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars
($50,000), and such individual Damages may not be applied towards the
Indemnity Deductible;

(ii) Subject to Section 11.4(c)(i), a Party shall not have any liability for
indemnification under Section 11.2(b)(iv) or Section 11.2(c) until and unless
the aggregate amount of the liability for all Damages for which Claim Notices
are timely delivered by the other Party exceeds a deductible amount equal to
$2,500,000 (the "Indemnity Deductible"), after which point the other Party (or
that Party's Indemnitees, as applicable) shall be entitled to claim Damages in
excess of the Indemnity Deductible; and

(iii) In no event shall a Party's aggregate liability arising from all claims
for indemnification (A) made under Section 11.2(b)(iv), exceed $25,000,000, or
(B) made under Section 11.2(c), exceed $18,750,000.
