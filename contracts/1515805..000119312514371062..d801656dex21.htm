     | (a) |

The Parties will, as promptly as practicable but in any event within 20 days
of the date of this Agreement (unless otherwise mutually agreed), make, or
cause to be made, all filings and applications with, and give all notices and
submissions to, Governmental Authorities that are necessary for the lawful
completion of the Contemplated Transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (i) the Purchaser and the Seller filing with the Commissioner a
notification under Part IX of the Competition Act; (ii) the Purchaser filing

commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Competition Act Approval and
each Party will promptly co-operate with and assist the other Party in
preparing the submissions referenced in Section 5.5(a) and all other filings
or responses to questions or requests from the Commissioner, Governmental
Authorities or the TSX. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in
the event that either, or both, of the Purchaser and the Seller receive a
supplementary information request pursuant to subsection 114(2) of the
Competition Act (a "SIR"), or an order to produce records, make a written
return of information, and/or have one or more employees attend an oral
examination conducted by the Commissioner (collectively, a "Section 11
Order"), in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, the Purchaser
and/or the Seller, as applicable, shall use its respective commercially
reasonable efforts to respond to the SIR or Section 11 Order at the earliest
practicable date. For purposes of this provision, the Purchaser and/or the
Seller, as applicable, shall be deemed to have responded to any such SIR or
Section 11 Order by providing a response that it in good faith believes to be
in compliance with the terms of the SIR or Section 11 Order and by certifying
such compliance pursuant to section 118 of the Competition Act or in
accordance with the SIR or Section 11 Order. In the event that the
Commissioner disputes the adequacy of compliance by the Purchaser and/or the
Seller, as applicable, with respect to a SIR or Section 11 Order, the
Purchaser and/or the Seller, as applicable, shall endeavour to satisfy the
Commissioner as soon as possible so as to minimize any delay in the conduct
or resolution of the Commissioners review of the Contemplated Transactions. 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Neither Party will provide any substantive oral nor written representations,
statements, information, remedy proposals or other filings to
the Commissioner without first giving the other a reasonable opportunity to
provide its comments, and each Party will consider such comments in good faith
before providing any such representations, statements, information or other
filings to the Commissioner. 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

Subject to compliance at all times with Applicable Law and the other
provisions of this Agreement and to information being competitively
sensitive, the Purchaser and Seller will coordinate and cooperate in
exchanging information and supplying assistance that is reasonably requested
by the other in connection with this 

---|---|--- 
 



49  Section 5.5 and will promptly provide each other with draft copies for
review and comment and final copies of all notifications, applications,
requests, submissions, undertakings, responses, substantive communications
and filings filed or provided to Governmental Authorities in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions. Each Party will also supply the other with
copies of all notices or other correspondence received from or the details of
any substantive communications with a Governmental Authority in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions promptly after receipt of such notices or
exchange of other correspondence or the occurrence of such communications.
Where a Party seeks not to provide the other Party with any information under
this Section 5.5(d) on grounds that such information is competitively
sensitive, such Party will be required to provide the information to the other
Partys external counsel and such external counsel will not provide the
information to its client, provided that nothing in this Agreement requires
either Party to share with the other Party or its external legal counsel any
information or documents related to their valuation of the Contemplated
Transaction. 

---|--- 



     | (e) |

Each Party shall provide the Commissioner at the earliest practicable date any
and all information, documents or other materials that may be requested by
the Commissioner in connection with his review of the Contemplated
Transactions, and neither Party will take any action that would have the
effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of Competition Act
Approval.  

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall participate in any substantive meeting,
telephone call, negotiation or discussion with the Commissioner regarding any
matters related to the Competition Act Approval, including proposed remedies
if applicable, without giving the other (or its external counsel) prior notice
of such substantive meeting, telephone call, negotiation or discussion and
the opportunity to attend and participate. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Seller shall not engage in any discussions with or make any proposals to the
Commissioner, whether written or oral, in relation to divestitures or remedies
without the express consent of the Purchaser. 

---|---|--- 



     | (g) |

The Parties will each pay 50% of all filing fees incurred in connection with
the Competition Act Approval as well as 50% of the fees and expenses of all
third party experts retained by either Party in connection with the
Competition Act Approval (provided that the retention of such third party
expert was approved by both Parties). 

---|---|--- 
 

Section 5.6 Request for Consents

 

The Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or cause to
be obtained, prior to Closing, all consents, approvals and waivers that are
required in connection with the Contemplated Transactions by the terms of any
Contract relating to the Business, any Real Property Lease or any License,
including the consents described in _Schedule 3.4(b)_. Such

Purchaser, acting reasonably. Purchaser will co-operate in obtaining such
consents, approvals and waivers.

 



50 Section 5.7 Cooperation to Secure Licences

 

The Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and
assist the Purchaser in obtaining rights to all third party licences to
Intellectual Property Rights that are required by the Purchaser, at its
discretion, to continue to operate the Business substantially in the same
manner in which the Business was operated by the ELN Companies prior to
Closing. The Sellers cooperation may include initiating discussions with
third party vendors and assisting with the negotiations of any applicable
licencing agreements.

 

Section 5.8 Financing



     | (a) |

The Purchaser shall use its best efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms
and conditions described in or contemplated by the Financing Commitments and
shall not agree to any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Financing Commitments without the prior written
consent of the Seller if such amendments, modifications or waivers would
or would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing below the amount required to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions or amend or modify any conditions in a manner adverse to the
Seller, (ii) impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of the
Financing, (iii) prevent or materially delay the Closing Date, or (iv)
adversely impact in any material respect the ability of Purchaser to enforce
its rights against the other parties to any of the Financing Commitments or
(v) adversely impact the Contemplated Transactions in any manner. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Without limiting the generality of Section 5.8(a), the Purchaser shall use
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect each of the Financing Commitments,
(ii) satisfy all conditions and covenants applicable to the Purchaser in the
Financing Commitments on or prior to the Closing and otherwise comply with its
obligations thereunder, (iii) enforce its rights under the
Financing Commitments and (iv) in the event that all conditions in the
Financing Commitments, the Subscription Receipt Agreement (as defined in the
Standby Purchase Agreement) and the Subscription Receipt Indenture (as defined
in the Debt Subscription Agreement) have been satisfied, cause the persons
providing the Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

The Purchaser shall keep the Seller promptly informed of the status of its
efforts to consummate the Financing and shall give Seller prompt
written notice: (i) of any material breach or material default (or any event
or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse or time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or material
default) by any party to the Financing Commitments or definitive document
related to the Financing of which Purchaser becomes aware; (ii) of the receipt
of any written notice or other written communication from any party to the
Financing Commitments with respect to any breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Financing Commitments or any definitive
document related to the Financing; and (iii) if the Purchaser becomes aware
that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the  

---|---|--- 
 



51  Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by
the Financing Commitments or the definitive documents related to the
Financing; provided that Purchaser need not provide any information that is
privileged. 

---|--- 



     | (d) |

In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions described in or contemplated by the Financing Commitments for any
reason whatsoever, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
occurrence of such event, the Purchaser shall use best efforts to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions
substantially not less favourable, taken as a whole, to Purchaser (in the
reasonable judgment of Purchaser) than those in the unavailable Financing
Commitments and that is sufficient, when taken together with the Purchasers
cash on hand and each of the Financing Commitments that remains available at
the time to pay the Purchase Price and the fees and expenses payable by the
Purchaser in connection with the Contemplated Transactions (the "Alternative
Financing"). The Purchaser shall keep Seller promptly informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange any
Alternative Financing. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Financing
Commitments" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar
agreement) with respect to any Alternative Financing arranged in compliance
herewith. 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts and
shall cause the ELN Companies to use commercially reasonable efforts, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its respective
representatives to, provide to the Purchaser, at the Purchasers sole expense
in respect of the Sellers out-of-pocket costs, all reasonable cooperation
requested by the Purchaser that is required in connection with the Financing
and any Alternative Financing, including (i) furnishing the Purchaser and
its financing sources with (1) copies of the Financial Statements, together
with, to the extent applicable, the report of the Sellers auditors with
respect thereto, and (2) all information relating to the ELN Companies and the
Business, including the financial statements required by Applicable Laws for
inclusion in any prospectus filed by PNCC with securities regulatory
authorities in Canada in connection with the Financing, it being understood
and agreed by the Parties that if any financial statements, other than the
financial statements prepared by the Seller prior to the date hereof, are
required to be prepared pursuant to Applicable Laws or otherwise in connection
with the Financing, all out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses relating to
the preparation and delivery of such financial statements shall be borne
exclusively by the Purchaser (information required to be delivered pursuant to
this clause (i) being referred to as the "Required Information"); (ii)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-
one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers, agents or
underwriters for, and prospective lenders and investors of or in, the
Financing and senior management and representatives, with appropriate
seniority and expertise, of the Business, including the chief executive
officer, chief financial officer and other senior executive officers of each
of the ELN Companies), due diligence sessions, (iii) providing monthly income
statements down to the EBITDA level (internal flash statement of income) for
the Business and monthly accounts receivable balance of the Business, (iv)
assisting with the 

---|---|--- 
 



52  preparation of customary materials for bank information memoranda, offering
documents, prospectuses, private placement memoranda and similar documents
required in connection with the Financing (including the delivery of any
consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to
the Financing and the delivery of one or more customary representation
letters), (v) using commercially reasonable effort to facilitate the pledging
of collateral in connection with the Financing, including executing and
delivering any documents as may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser, (vi)
providing access and information reasonably requested by the Purchaser to
allow the Purchaser to undertake inventory appraisals, field audits,
environmental assessments and obtain surveys and title insurance, (vii)
providing to the sources of the Financing all documentation and other
information required by regulatory authorities with respect to the Company
under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the _Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist
Financing Act_ (Canada)), (viii) causing the taking of corporate actions
(subject to the occurrence of the Closing) by the ELN Companies reasonably
necessary to permit the completion of the Financing, (ix) facilitating the
execution and delivery at the Closing (subject to the occurrence of the
Closing) of definitive documents related to the Financing on the terms
contemplated by the Financing Commitments, and (x) using commercially
reasonable efforts to cause accountants and legal counsel to provide their
reasonable cooperation and assistance, including participating in a reasonable
number of due diligence sessions and drafting sessions; provided, however,
that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would
interfere unreasonably with the operation of the Business; provided, further,
that the Seller and the ELN Companies shall not be required to take any action
described in this Section 5.8 that would become legally binding on any of them
prior to the Closing. Neither the Seller nor any of the ELN Companies shall
be required to take any action that would subject any of them to any
liability, to bear any third-party cost or expense or to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or make any other payment (other than reasonable out-of-
pocket costs or any such costs, expenses, fees or payments to be reimbursed by
the Purchaser) or incur any other liability or provide or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Financing or any of the foregoing, which is
effective prior to the Closing. The Seller will ensure that none of the
Required Information contains any misrepresentations (as defined in the
_Securities Act_ (Ontario)) regarding the Seller, the ELN Companies or
the Business. The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and
the ELN Companies and their representatives from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement or completion of the Financing (including any action taken in
accordance with this Section 5.8) and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than the Required Information) except in the event such
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments or penalties arose out of or result from the wilful misconduct,
intentional misrepresentation or gross negligence of the Seller, its
Affiliates or any of their respective officers, employees or representatives.
The Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by the Seller, reimburse the Seller
and the ELN Companies for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Seller and the ELN Companies in 

---|--- 
 



53 connection with this Section 5.8(e). The Seller hereby consents to the
reasonable use of the ELN Companies logos in connection with the Financing,
provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the ELN Companies in any respect. 

---|--- 
 

Section 5.9 Exclusivity

From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or the Termination
Date, the Seller shall not, and it shall not permit the ELN Companies, any of
their directors, officers or employees, or any of its respective Affiliates,
agents or representatives acting on their behalf to, directly or indirectly,
(a) solicit, initiate, seek or encourage any inquiry, offer or proposal from,
(b) initiate or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, (c)
furnish any information or documentation to, or (d) accept any offer from or

Purchaser and its Affiliates and representatives) relating to any direct or
indirect sale or business combination of any of the ELN Companies or any
direct or indirect sale of the Business or any of the Publications or Digital
Properties.

Section 5.10 Public Announcements

The initial press release with respect to this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions shall be a release mutually acceptable to the Purchaser and the
Seller. Thereafter, neither Party nor any of their respective Affiliates,
agents or representatives shall, without the prior written consent of the
other Party, issue any press release or make any other public announcement
concerning this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions except (i) as
required by Applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable stock
exchange or (ii) for press releases or other public announcements that
are substantially similar to previous press releases or public announcements
made by either Party in compliance with this Section 5.10.

 

Section 5.11 Restrictive Covenants of the Seller

 

In furtherance of the sale of the Shares hereunder, and to protect more
effectively the value and goodwill of the Business, the Seller
hereby covenants and agrees as follows:



     | (a) |

_Non-Competition_. For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on
the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the Seller shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly own, control, manage,
operate, conduct, engage in, participate in, consult with, perform services
for, guarantee the debts or obligations of, permit its name to be used by or
in connection with, or otherwise carry on, (i) English language newspaper
operations or (ii) websites or other digital content relating to English
language news, anywhere in Canada provided, however, that this Section 5.11(a)
shall in no way apply to, or restrict the operations of (A) Sun TV or
websites or other digital content related thereto, or (B) any and all English
language magazine operations or websites or other digital content related
thereto.  

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

_Non-Solicitation of Employees of the Business_. For a period commencing on
the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, Solicit the employment or engagement of or hire (whether as an
employee, freelance or  

---|---|--- 
 



54  independent contractor or otherwise) any Employee, freelance or independent
contractor who has been employed by or rendering services on a regular basis
to the Business at any time during the most recent 12 months preceding the
date hereof; provided however that the non-solicitation obligations set forth
herein shall not apply in any way to: 

---|--- 



     | (i) |

any Employee, freelance or independent contractor (A) who responds to a
general advertisement, (B) whose employment or engagement with the Business
has been terminated, with or without cause, by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, or (C) who, at the time of solicitation, has not worked for or
been engaged by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in relation to
the Business for a period of at least six months; or 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

any freelance or independent contractor (including for avoidance of doubt,
journalists and media personalities, or information technology contractors
and consultants) who: 

---|---|--- 



     | (A) |

on or prior to the Closing Date, renders or has rendered services or provides
or has provided content to the Seller, its Affiliates or the ELN Companies in
relation to the Business on a non-exclusive basis; or 

---|---|--- 



     | (B) |

after the Closing Date, renders or will render services or provides or will
provide content to the Purchaser, its Affiliates or the ELN Companies in
relation to the Business on a non-exclusive basis; 

---|---|--- 

provided that the Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, Solicit any freelance or independent contractor to
terminate its employment or engagement with the Purchaser, its Affiliates or
the ELN Companies.

 



     | (c) |

_Non-Solicitation of Certain Customers of the Business._ For a period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, solicit the business of any Person that has, or had
within the most recent 12 months preceding the date hereof, an active business
relationship or is seeking to have an active business relationship with any
of the ELN Companies with respect to the commercial printing operations of the
Business (a "Commercial Printing Customer") provided that this Section 5.11(c)
shall not prohibit the Seller or its Affiliates from soliciting business from
a Commercial Printing Customer to the extent that (i) during the 12 months
ended June 30, 2014 orders from such Commercial Printing Customer were
satisfied at both the Islington and Mirabel commercial printing facilities of
the Seller and (ii) any orders that the Seller secures from such Commercial
Printing Customer during such three year period are allocated to the Islington
and Mirabel commercial printing facilities in a manner that is generally
consistent with the manner in which orders were allocated between such
facilities during the 12 months ended June 30, 2014. 

---|---|--- 
 



55 _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing Date, the Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates, agents and representatives to, keep confidential
and not disclose or use any Confidential Information, other than to disclose
Confidential Information to the Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Seller or any of its Affiliates, agents or representatives
(collectively, the "Disclosing Party") is requested or required by Applicable
Law to disclose any Confidential Information, the Disclosing Party will
provide the Purchaser with notice of such request or requirement as promptly
as practicable (unless not permitted by Applicable Law) so that the Purchaser
may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive
compliance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.11(d). The
Disclosing Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the Purchaser in connection with the Purchasers efforts to seek such an order
or remedy. If the Purchaser does not obtain such an order or other remedy, or
waives compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.11(d), the Disclosing
Party will furnish only that portion of the applicable Confidential
Information that is legally required, and will exercise reasonable efforts to
obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
disclosed information. 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

_Equitable Remedies_. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the
Purchaser and its Affiliates would suffer irreparable and ongoing damages
(including a significant loss of the goodwill of the Business purchased by the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement) in the event that any provision of this
Section 5.11 were not performed in accordance with its terms or otherwise
were breached; and (ii) monetary damages, even if available, alone would not
be an adequate remedy for any such non-performance or breach. Accordingly, the
Seller agrees that, in the event of any actual or threatened breach of any
provision of this Section 5.11, the Purchaser shall be entitled, in addition
to all other rights and remedies that it may have existing in its favour at
law, in equity or otherwise, to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief
(including a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction and a
final injunction) to prevent any actual or threatened breach of any of such
provisions and to enforce such provisions specifically, without the necessity
of posting a bond or other security or of proving actual damages. 

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

_Severability; Reformation_. Each of the covenants set forth in this Section
5.11 is a severable and independent covenant. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any covenant as written in any jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants in this Section
5.11, or such covenant in any other jurisdiction. The existence of any claim
or cause of action against one party by any other party, whether predicated
on the breach of this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense
to the enforcement of the covenants set forth in this Section 5.11. If, at the
time of enforcement of any provision of this Section 5.11, a final
determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that any of the
covenants contained in this Section 5.11 is unreasonable or otherwise
unenforceable under Applicable Law, the parties hereby authorize and instruct
such court to revise and reform the scope, geographic area and/or duration of
the provisions of this Section 5.11 so as to produce the maximum legally
enforceable restrictions (not greater than those contained herein) permitted
by Applicable Law. If such court refuses to do so, the parties agree that the
provisions of this Section 5.11 shall not 

---|---|--- 
 



56  be rendered null and void, but rather shall be deemed amended to provide for
such maximum legally enforceable restrictions. 

---|--- 
 



     | (g) |

_Acknowledgements_. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the covenants
set forth in this Section 5.11 are a material inducement to the Purchaser to
enter into this Agreement and consummate the Contemplated Transactions; (ii)
but for these covenants, the Purchaser would not have entered into this
Agreement or agreed to acquire the Shares; and (iii) in view of the nature of
the Business, the business objectives of the Purchaser in acquiring the
Shares, and the consideration paid for the Shares, the restrictive covenants
set forth in this Section 5.11 are reasonable with respect to their scope,
duration and geographic area and duration and are necessary in order to
protect the Purchasers legitimate business interests (including the goodwill
of the Business). 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (h) |

_No Consideration for Covenants_. The Parties agree that the undertakings set
forth in Section 5.11(a) and Section 5.11(b) form an integral part of this
Agreement and are granted to maintain or preserve the fair market value of the
Shares. The Parties further acknowledge and confirm that no portion of the
Purchase Price is allocated, considered or regarded as a consideration for
the undertakings contained in this Agreement or any other covenant of the
Seller contained in this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 

Section 5.12 Covenants regarding Commercial Printing Customers

For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Parties agree to continue providing
services to the Commercial Printing Customers currently served under the same
Contract by the Mirabel and Islington commercial printing facilities (the
"Commercial Printing Contracts"), including the Contracts listed in Schedule
5.12, in a manner that is generally consistent with the manner in which they
have been served during the 12 months ended June 30, 2014. For a period of up
to three years after the Closing Date, the Parties undertake to negotiate in
good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to renew the Commercial

Section 5.13 Tax Matters



     | (a) |

_Filing of Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Periods_. The Purchaser will cause each
of the Purchased ELN Companies to prepare and file all Tax Returns for the
Purchased ELN Companies that are due after the Closing Date in respect of
periods ending on or before the Closing Date, which Tax Returns shall be
prepared and filed on a timely basis consistent with the Purchased ELN
Companies existing procedures for preparing Tax Returns and in a manner
consistent with prior practice (unless otherwise required by Applicable Law).
The Purchaser shall provide the Seller with a draft of such Tax Returns and
any relevant working papers at least 35 days prior to the due date for filing
the Tax Returns with the appropriate taxing authorities. The Seller shall have
the right to review the draft of the Tax Returns provided to it by the
Purchaser and make any comments that it deems appropriate. The Purchaser
shall incorporate all reasonable comments that the Seller may have 

---|---|--- 
 



57  on such Tax Returns. If the Seller notifies the Purchaser that the Seller
agrees with the filing of such Tax Returns or fails to deliver notice to the
Purchaser of its disagreement therewith within 20 days of receipt of the
draft Tax Returns, the Purchaser shall file the Tax Returns, but in no event
shall such filing take place after its due date. If the Seller, acting in good
faith, believes that such Tax Returns are not prepared in accordance with
this Section 5.13(a), the Seller shall notify in writing the Purchaser of its
disagreement within 20 days after receipt of the draft Tax Returns, together
with reasonable particulars of the basis of such disagreement. The Purchaser
and the Seller shall attempt, in good faith, to resolve their differences with
respect thereto within 10 days after the Sellers notice of disagreement. To
the extent that the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to agree,
the disagreement may be referred by either Party for determination by an
independent accounting firm in a similar manner as contemplated by Section
2.3(b) provided that the independent accounting firm must complete its
determination no later than on the filing due date of the Tax Returns and if
such determination cannot be completed prior to the filing due date, the
Purchased ELN Companies shall be entitled to file the Tax Returns, subject to
amended Tax Returns being filed if the independent accounting firm so
determines. While the independent accounting firm is making its determination
hereunder, the Parties shall not communicate with the independent accounting
firm on the subject matter of its review, except by joint conference call,
joint meeting or letter with copy simultaneously delivered to the other Party.
In the case of a disagreement and the hiring of an independent accounting firm
in accordance with this Section 5.13(a), the fees and expenses of
the independent accounting firm shall be borne equally by the Purchaser and
the Seller. Once the disagreement is settled amongst the Purchaser and the
Seller or the Tax Returns are determined by the independent accounting firm
hired pursuant to this Section 5.13(a), the Purchaser shall file the Tax
Returns. The Seller shall promptly pay to the applicable Governmental
Authority on behalf of the relevant Purchased ELN Company(ies), when due, all
Taxes (other than Taxes which were taken into account in the calculation of
the Final Closing Working Capital) payable by the relevant Purchased ELN
Company(ies) in respect of periods ending on or before the Closing Date as
indicated on such Tax Returns, and any such payment will be treated by the
Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for tax purposes. The Seller
shall cooperate fully with the Purchaser and make available to the Purchaser
on a timely basis all information as may reasonably be required for the
preparation of any Tax Return for a period. 

---|--- 



     | (b) |

_Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall (and, if requested to do so, shall cause their respective
Affiliates, including the ELN Companies, to), at no cost to the other Party:
(i) assist each other in preparing any Tax Returns that any other Party is
responsible for preparing and filing; (ii) cooperate fully in preparing
for or defending against any Tax Contests with taxing authorities regarding
any Tax Returns of the Purchased ELN Companies; (iii) make available to the
other Party and to any taxing authority as reasonably requested all
information, records and documents relating to Taxes of the Company; and (iv)
furnish the other Party with timely written notice of, and copies of all
correspondence received from any taxing authority in connection with, any Tax
Contest relating to Taxes of the Purchased ELN Companies for the Pre-Closing 

---|---|--- 
 



58  Period. The Seller and the Purchaser further agree, upon request, to use
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on the Purchased ELN
Companies. 

---|--- 



     | (c) |

_Changes to Tax Positions_. Except as required by Applicable Law, the
Purchaser covenants that it will not, and it will not cause or permit the
Purchased ELN Companies to take any action on or after the Closing, make any
election or deemed election or make or change any Tax election, amend any Tax
Return or take any position on any Tax Return that results in any increased
Tax liability or reduction of any deduction, credit or loss carry-over of any
such entity in respect of any period ending on or before or which includes the
Closing Date. The Purchaser agrees that the Seller is to have no liability for
any Tax (including any related interest and penalties) resulting from any
action referred to in the preceding sentence. 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

If (i) the aggregate of all amounts (a) which are included in Tax receivables
for the purposes of the definition of "Current Assets" and (b) which
otherwise reduce Taxes payable for the purposes of the definition of "Current
Liabilities", in each case resulting from the application of the loss
restriction event rules in section 111 of the Tax Act as a result of the
Contemplated Transactions, for the purposes of the Final Closing Working
Capital, exceeds (ii) 26.9% of the aggregate deductions from taxable income
with respect to the Purchased ELN Companies under subsections 111(5.1) and
111(5.2) of the Tax Act as a result of the Contemplated Transactions, then the
Seller shall pay to the Purchaser, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price,
such excess amount. For greater certainty, the amount at (i) in the preceding
sentence cannot exceed $1,614,000, and therefore the amount of the adjustment
to Purchase Price payable by the Seller to the Purchaser under this Section
5.13(d) cannot exceed $1,614,000. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) |

_Survival_. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.13 shall survive the
Closing. 

---|---|--- 
 

Section 5.14 Expenses

Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, regardless of
whether or not the Closing occurs, each Party shall be responsible for and
shall pay all of its own costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses
of its lawyers, accountants, investment bankers and other advisors) incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions.

Section 5.15 Further Assurances

At any time and from time to time following the Closing each Party shall,
without any further consideration, execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, such other documents and instruments and shall take,
or cause to be taken, such further or other actions as the other Party may
reasonably request or as otherwise may be necessary or desirable to evidence
and make effective the Contemplated Transactions.

 



59 Section 5.16 Preservation of Records

 

Subject to the requirements of Applicable Law, the Confidentiality Agreement
and each Partys confidentiality obligations to its clients or other third
parties by any Governmental Authority or third party, in order to facilitate
the resolution of any claims made by or against any of the parties relating to
the Company or in respect of the Business, for a period of six years after
the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be required by Applicable
Law), each of the Purchaser and the Seller shall (a) retain the books and
records relating to the Company and the Business (including those of the ELN
Companies to the extent they have been transferred by the Seller to the
Purchaser) over which it has control, to the extent such books and records
relate to periods prior to the Closing Date, and (b) upon reasonable advance
written notice and during normal business hours, afford the other party and
its officers, managers, employees, agents and representatives reasonable
access (including the right to make photocopies, at such other partys
expense) to such books and records for any proper, non-competitive purpose;
provided, however, that any such access shall not unreasonably disrupt the
normal operations of either Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand, shall desire to
dispose of any such books and records prior to the expiration of the six-year
anniversary of the Closing Date, such party shall, prior to such disposition,
give the other Party a reasonable opportunity, at such other partys expense,
to copy such books and records in accordance with this Section 5.16.

Section 5.17 Post-Closing Remittances

 



     | (a) |

From and after the Closing Date, if the Seller or any of its Affiliates
receives any payment from a third party that is owed to a Purchased
ELN Company, the Seller shall hold, or cause the applicable Affiliate to
hold, such payment in trust and promptly (and in no event later than 30 days
following receipt) remit such amounts to the Purchaser or the Purchased ELN
Company.  

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

From and after the Closing Date, if the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Purchased ELN Companies) receives any payment from a third
party that is owed to the Seller or any of its Affiliates, the Purchaser shall
hold, or cause the applicable Affiliate to hold, such payment in trust and
promptly (and in no event later than 30 days following receipt) remit such
amounts to the Seller. 

---|---|--- 

Section 5.18 Litigation Cooperation

 

With respect to any Pre-Closing Actions, the Purchaser agrees to cooperate
with the Seller after Closing and make available to the Seller or its
representatives, upon the reasonable request of the Seller, all documents,
records and other materials in the possession of the Purchaser or any of the
ELN Companies and to grant the Seller reasonable access to those employees,
officers, directors, contractors and consultants having knowledge regarding
such Actions, in each case that are reasonably required by the Seller for its
use in defending any such Action.

 

Section 5.19 PCI Compliance

The Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that,
within 18 months of the Closing Date, the Business will, at the cost of the
Purchaser, comply with all applicable Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standards. After the Closing Date, the Purchaser will not take any action, or
omit to take any action, which would reasonably be expected to have an adverse
effect

 



60  on the Business compliance, or current or future efforts to become
compliant, with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards.

 

Section 5.20 Change of Name

No later than 180 days after the Closing Date and subject to the terms of the
License Agreement, the Seller shall (i) cause any Affiliate that has a
corporate name that is included in the Intellectual Property (including "Sun
Media") to file the appropriate documentation with the appropriate
Governmental Authorities to change their respective corporate names to a name
that does not include any name that is included in the Intellectual Property
and (ii) cease using any business or trade names associated with the
foregoing corporate names, except as otherwise contemplated in the License
Agreement.

Section 5.21 Information Technology Assets and Licences

The Seller shall promptly and in any event not less than 30 days prior to
Closing deliver to the Purchaser a list, certified in writing as accurate by
the Sellers Chief Financial Officer, that identifies all information
technology assets, including all hardware and other equipment and software or
other technology, that are owned or leased by, or licensed to, an ELN Company
and are necessary for the conduct of the Business after the Closing
substantially in the same manner as conducted prior to the date hereof. The
Seller shall either (i) ensure, at its own cost, that all such assets are
owned or leased by, or licensed to, one of the Purchased ELN Companies as of
the Closing or (ii) deliver to the Purchaser an updated version of Schedule
3.14(b) that includes any such assets that will not be owned or leased by, or
licensed to, one of the Purchased ELN Companies as of the Closing.

Section 5.22 Transition Services Agreement

 

The Purchaser and the Seller shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date hereof, negotiate in good faith the form of Transition
Services Agreement, which form shall include the terms and conditions set out
in ANNEX VI and otherwise be mutually acceptable to the Purchaser and Seller,
each acting reasonably. In anticipation of the performance of the
Transition Services Agreement, the Seller agrees to cause Videotron s.e.n.c.
or its applicable Affiliate (collectively, "Videotron") to enter into, prior
to the Closing Date, a three year hosting agreement with the Purchaser on the
same terms and conditions applicable to hosting services provided by
Videotron to the Seller that were in effect in the 12 month period prior to
the date hereof and will include rights for Purchaser to (i) terminate any
portion of the services offered thereunder, including but not limited to with
respect to any reduction of server racks, without penalty or other additional
fee or (ii) terminate the entire hosting agreement without penalty or other
additional fee on 60 days notice.

 

Section 5.23 Waiver of Conflicts

 

Recognizing that Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP has acted as legal counsel to
the Seller and the ELN Companies and certain of their respective Affiliates
prior to date hereof, and that Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP intends to act as
legal counsel to certain of the Seller and its Affiliates (which will no
longer include the ELN Companies) after the Closing, each of the Purchaser and
the ELN Companies hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its
Affiliates and the ELN Companies to waive, any conflicts that may arise in
connection with Fasken Martineau DuMoulin

 



61  LLP representing the Seller or its Affiliates after the Closing as such
representation may relate to the Purchaser or the ELN Companies in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions. In addition, all communications involving
attorney-client confidences between the Seller, the ELN Companies and their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP, on
the other hand, relating to the negotiation, documentation and consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to the Seller and its Affiliates (and not the
ELN Companies). Accordingly, the ELN Companies shall not have access to any
such communications or to the files of Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP relating
to such engagement from and after the Closing. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (a) the Seller and its
Affiliates (and not the ELN Companies) shall be the sole holders of the
attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the ELN
Companies shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of Fasken
Martineau DuMoulin LLP in respect of such engagement constitute property of
the client, only the Seller and its Affiliates (and not the ELN Companies)
shall hold such property rights and (c) Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP shall
have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to the ELN Companies by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP and the ELN Companies or
otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the ELN Companies is
waiving any attorney-client privilege (including relating to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the Contemplated Transactions) in connection
with any third party litigation.

by either the Purchaser or the Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before the Outside Date; provided, however, that the right to terminate

67 Section 8.4 Limitations on Indemnification

 

The rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 8 are subject to the following limitations:



     | (a) |

_Basket and Caps_. 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

The Seller shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties against, or reimburse the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for, any Damages pursuant to Section 8.2(a) unless and until the
aggregate amount of the Damages with respect to the matters contemplated
thereby exceeds $2,750,000 (the "Basket"), in which case all such Damages
including the Basket may be recovered up to a maximum aggregate amount of
Damages of $45,000,000 (the "Cap"); provided, however, that the Basket and Cap
shall not apply with respect to any indemnification claims to the extent
arising out of, resulting from, or in connection with or arising out of (1)
any breach of or inaccuracy in the Sellers Fundamental Representations, (2)
any fraud or fraudulent or intentional misrepresentation by the Seller. For
the avoidance of doubt, the limitations on indemnification set forth in this
Section 8.4(a)(i) shall not apply to any indemnification claims pursuant to
Section 8.2(b) and Section 8.2(c). 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

The Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the
Seller Indemnified Parties against, or reimburse the Seller Indemnified
Parties for, any Damages pursuant to Section 8.3(a) unless and until the
aggregate amount of Damages with respect to the matters contemplated thereby
exceeds the Basket, in which case all such Damages including the Basket may
be recovered up to a maximum aggregate amount of Damages equal to the Cap;
provided, however, that the Basket and the Cap shall not apply with respect to
any indemnification claims arising out of, resulting from or in connection
with (A) any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the Purchasers Fundamental
Representations or (B) any fraud or fraudulent or intentional
misrepresentation by the Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitation
on indemnification set forth in this Section 8.4(a)(ii) shall not apply to
any indemnification claims pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and Section 8.3(c). 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

_Calculation of Damages_. 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

For the purposes of this Article 8, the amount of Damages incurred or suffered
by any Indemnified Party shall be calculated (A) net of any amount actually
recovered by such Indemnified Party from a third party alleged to be
responsible for such Damages, less the costs and expenses incurred to obtain
such recovery; and (B) net of any third party insurance proceeds
actually received by such Indemnified Party for such Damages under any
insurance policy, (excluding self-insurance arrangements) less the costs and
expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party to collect any such insurance
proceeds (including reasonable attorneys fees, any deductibles or self- 

---|---|--- 
 



68  insured retentions, any increases in premium or any retroactive premium
adjustments directly related to obtaining such insurance proceeds). 

---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

Any Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to double recovery for any Damages
even though the Damages may have resulted from the breach of more than one of
the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants made by the
Indemnifying Party in this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification for
any Damages relating to any matter to the extent (but only to the extent)
that the amount of such Damages is specifically and identifiably reflected as
a Current Liability in the calculation of the Final Closing Working Capital
pursuant to Section 2.3. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) |

In no event shall an Indemnified Party be entitled to make an indemnification
claim for any punitive, special, incidental, indirect or consequential
damages of any kind or nature, regardless of the form of action through which
such damages are sought, except to the extent such damages are awarded to a
third party in connection with a Third Party Claim or except in connection
with any fraud, or fraudulent or intentional misrepresentation. In no event
shall the Seller be liable for lost profits resulting from an alleged breach
of this Agreement, even if under Applicable Law, such lost profits would not
be considered consequential or special damages, except to the extent damages
for such lost profits are awarded to a third party in connection with a Third
Party Claim or except in connection with any fraud, or fraudulent or
intentional misrepresentation.  

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

_Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Damages that such Indemnified Party asserts under
this Article 8 to the extent required by Applicable Law; provided, however,
that an Indemnified Partys obligation to mitigate any Damages shall not
require any such Indemnified Party to (i) initiate any Action, (ii) assume or
incur any material liability or (iii) take any other action that would
reasonably be expected to materially disrupt or otherwise materially affect
such Indemnified Partys business or operations. Any reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party in connection with such
mitigation shall constitute Damages that may be recovered hereunder. 

---|---|--- 
 

Section 8.5 Third Party Claim Procedures



     | (a) |

_Notice_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion of any
claim or the commencement of any Action by a third party (including a
Governmental Authority) in respect of which indemnification shall be sought
hereunder (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice (a "Claim Notice") thereof
describing in reasonable detail (based on the information then available to
the Indemnified Party) the basis for the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) an Indemnified Party shall not be required to give a Claim
Notice in respect of any matters listed on Schedule 3.11(a) and (ii) the
failure or delay of the Indemnified Party to give a Claim Notice shall 

---|---|--- 
 



69  not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations to provide
indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent (and only to the
extent) that the Indemnifying Party shall have been materially and adversely
prejudiced by such failure. 

---|--- 



     | (b) |

_Defense_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 8.5 and,
except with respect to the matters listed on  _Schedule 3.11(a)_, provided
always that any Claim Notice is provided prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period provided herein, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to elect to conduct and control the defense, compromise or
settlement of any Third Party Claim, with counsel of its choice reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party and at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost
and expense; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may
participate therein through separate counsel chosen by it and at its sole
cost and expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to conduct and control the defense, compromise or settlement of
any Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice and at the Indemnifying
Partys sole cost and expense if: (A) the Indemnifying Party shall not have
acknowledged in writing its indemnification obligations hereunder and given
notice of its election to conduct and control the defense of the Third Party
Claim within fifteen days after the Indemnifying Partys receipt of a Claim
Notice; (B) the Indemnifying Party shall fail to conduct such defense
diligently and in good faith; (C) the Indemnified Party shall reasonably
determine that use of counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party to represent
the Indemnified Party would present such counsel with an actual conflict of
interest; (D) the Third Party Claim seeks injunctive, equitable or other non-
monetary relief against the Indemnified Party or monetary damages in excess of
125% of the Cap; or (E) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal or regulatory proceeding. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

_Defense of Pre-Closing Period Action_. Seller shall conduct and control the
defense, compromise or settlement of any Pre-Closing Period Action, with
counsel of its choice and at the Sellers sole cost and expense. 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

_Cooperation_. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates and representatives to, cooperate
with the defense or prosecution of each Third Party Claim, including
furnishing such records, information and testimony and attending such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party in
connection therewith. In connection with any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to avoid production of confidential information to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law and to cause all communications among employees,
counsel and other third parties representing any party to a Third Party Claim
to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product
privileges. The party controlling the defense of any Third Party Claim shall
keep the non-controlling party advised of the status thereof and shall
consider in good faith any recommendations made by the non-controlling party
with respect thereto. 

---|---|--- 
 



70 _Settlement Limitations_. Except with regard to Pre-Closing Period Actions and
as set forth below, no Third Party Claim may be settled or compromised (i) by
the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party or (ii) by the Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, in each case which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay, settle or compromise any Third
Party Claim, provided that in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive
all rights against the Indemnifying Party to indemnification under this
Article 8 with respect to such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnified Party
shall have sought the consent of the Indemnifying Party to such payment,
settlement or compromise and such consent shall have been unreasonably
withheld, conditions or delayed; and (B) the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to enter into a settlement with respect to any Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party if the judgment or
settlement (1) involves only the payment of money damages (all of which will
be paid in full by the Indemnifying Party concurrently with the effectiveness
thereof), (2) will not encumber any of the assets of the Indemnified Party
and will not contain any restriction or condition that would apply to or
adversely affect the Indemnified Party or the conduct of its business, (3)
does not include an admission of wrong doing and (4) includes, as a condition
to any settlement or other resolution, a complete and irrevocable release of
the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) |

_Settlement of Pre-Closing Period Actions._ Seller shall be permitted to
settle or compromise any and all Pre-Closing Period Actions unless the
judgment or settlement related thereto (1) will encumber any of the assets of
any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or will contain any restriction or
condition that would apply to or adversely affect the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties or the conduct of its business, or (2) includes an admission of wrong
doing on the part any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, or (3) includes,
as a condition to any settlement or other resolution, a complete and
irrevocable release of a Purchaser Indemnified Party from all liability in
respect of such Pre-Closing Period Action. 

---|---|--- 



     | (g) |

_Payments_. The Indemnifying Party(ies) shall pay to the applicable
Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated in writing by such Indemnified Party, all amounts
payable pursuant to this Article 8 promptly (and in no event later than 30
days) following receipt from such Indemnified Party of a bill or invoice,
together with reasonable supporting documentation, for a Damage that is the
subject of indemnification hereunder, unless the Indemnifying Party in good
faith disputes the Damage, in which event it shall so notify the Indemnified
Party. In any event, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the applicable
Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by such Indemnified Party, the amount of any
Damages for which it is liable hereunder no later than three days following
any final determination of such Damages and the Indemnifying Partys liability
therefor. A "final determination" with respect to a dispute shall exist when
(i) the parties to such dispute have reached an agreement in writing
resolving such dispute, (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction shall have
entered a final and non-appealable 

---|---|--- 
 



71  order or judgment resolving such dispute or (iii) an arbitration or like
panel to which the parties have submitted such dispute shall have rendered a
final and non-appealable determination with respect to such dispute. Any
amounts due hereunder that are not paid when due shall bear interest from such
due date until the payment date at the prime rate as published by the Bank of
Nova Scotia on the due date. 

---|--- 
 



     | (h) |

_Tax Contest_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.5,
the Seller shall have the right to represent the ELN Companies interests in
any Tax Contest relating to Tax liabilities for which the Seller would be
required to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to this
Article 8 and which relate to any Pre-Closing Period; provided, however, that
the Seller shall have no right to represent the ELN Companies interests in
any Tax Contest unless (i) the Seller shall have first notified the Purchaser
in writing of their intention to do so within thirty days of receipt
of notice of the Third Party Claim for Taxes, (ii) shall have agreed with the
Purchaser in writing that, as between the Purchaser and the Seller, the Seller
shall be liable for any Taxes that result from such Tax Contest and (iii)
shall have paid to the Purchaser an amount equal to the amount of such Taxes
required to be paid by the Company as and when required under Applicable Law,
notwithstanding that such Tax Contest many not have been finally determined.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (A) the Seller shall not have given notice
of their election to represent the Companys interests in the Tax Contest
within such 30-day period, (B) the Seller shall fail to conduct such defense
diligently and in good faith or (C) the Purchaser shall reasonably determine
that use of counsel selected by the Seller to represent the Purchaser would
present such counsel with an actual or potential conflict of interest, then in
each such case the Purchaser shall have the right to control the defense,
compromise or settlement of the Tax Contest with counsel of its choice at the
Sellers sole cost and expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller
shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the
commencement of litigation, any Tax Contest without the prior written consent
of the Purchaser, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed by the Purchaser, and may not be withheld, conditioned and delayed
if the Seller has indemnified the Purchaser in a manner reasonably acceptable
to the Purchaser against the effects of any such settlement. 

---|---|--- 
 

Section 8.6 Direct Claim Procedures

 

If any Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification hereunder that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party written notice thereof describing in reasonable detail
(based on the information then available to the Indemnified Party) the basis
for such claim and the amount of the Damages claimed by the Indemnified
Party (the "Claimed Amount") in respect thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the failure or delay of the Indemnified Party to give such notice
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations
hereunder except to the extent (and only to the extent) that the Indemnifying
Party shall have been materially and adversely prejudiced by such failure and
provided always that any such notice is provided prior to the expiration of
the applicable survival period provided herein. Within thirty days after
delivery of such notice, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the
Indemnified Party a written response in which the Indemnifying Party shall (i)
agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed
Amount (in which case

 



72  such response shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party of
the Claimed Amount), (ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
receive part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the "Agreed Amount") (in
which case such response shall be accompanied by payment by the Indemnifying
Party of the Agreed Amount), or (iii) in good faith dispute that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount. If the
Indemnifying Party timely disputes the payment of all or part of the Claimed
Amount, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as practicable. If such
dispute is not resolved within fifteen days following the delivery by the
Indemnifying Party of such response, the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall each have the right to submit such dispute for
resolution to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the
provisions of Section 9.8.

Section 8.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments

 

All indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be made on an
After-Tax Basis and , to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, shall be
treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes. If an indemnification payment would otherwise be included in the
Indemnified Partys income, the Indemnified Party covenants and agrees to make
all such elections and take all such actions that are available, acting
reasonably, to minimize or eliminate Taxes with respect to the indemnification
payment, provided that such elections and actions are not otherwise
prejudicial to the Indemnified Party.

Section 8.8 Effect of Waiver

 

The right to indemnification and payment of Damages under this Article 8 based
on a breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall not be
affected by any investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge acquired
(or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, by or on
behalf of any of the parties or their respective representatives with respect
to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any such representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any such covenant or agreement, shall not affect any partys
right to indemnification, payment of Damages or any other remedy based on a
breach of any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

Section 8.9 No Contribution 

The Seller acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article
8 is an obligation solely of the Seller and that from and after the Closing,
the Seller shall not be entitled to contribution from, subrogation to or
recovery against the Purchaser, the Company or their Affiliates with respect
to any Damages imposed on or incurred by the Seller in connection with this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions arising out of, relating to or in
respect of the Closing, any period prior to the Closing or any breach by the
Seller of any of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement.

 



73 Section 8.10 Exclusive Remedy

 

Except for (a) the remedies of specific performance or injunctive or other
equitable relief, (b) claims for fraud or fraudulent or intentional
misrepresentation or (c) other remedies expressly provided in this Agreement
(including Section 2.3 with respect to the calculation of the Final Closing
Working Capital, Section 5.11 with respect to the enforcement of
the restrictive covenants set forth therein and Section 5.13(a) with respect
to the filing of Tax Returns of Pre-Closing Periods), if the Closing occurs,
the indemnification rights set forth in this Article 8 shall be the sole and
exclusive monetary remedy for any claim arising out of this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions.

Section 9.2 Counterparts

This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile, "pdf" or other electronic transmission) in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Section 9.3 Amendments and Waivers

 

This Agreement may not be amended or waived except by an instrument in writing
signed, in the case of an amendment, by an authorized representative of each
party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom
such waiver is to be effective. No course of conduct or failure or delay by
any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege. The rights and remedies provided herein shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

Section 9.4 Severability

 

Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be interpreted in such manner
as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law, but if any one or more of
the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction
or other authority, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but
only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that

 



75  the Contemplated Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 9.5 Assignment; Successors and Assigns

 

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of any
party hereunder may be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred by such
party, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without
the prior written consent of each other party, and any attempted assignment,
delegation or other transfer without such consent shall be null and
void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser may assign any or all of
its rights and interests and obligations under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, without the consent of the other parties, (a) to any
Affiliate of the Purchaser, subject to the assumption in writing by such
Affiliate of the Purchasers obligations hereunder; (b) to any Person who
acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Purchaser
or as a matter of law to the surviving entity in any merger, consolidation or
reorganization involving the Purchaser; and (c) to any lender(s) (including
any agent for any lender(s)) as collateral security for any indebtedness of
the Purchaser and its Affiliates, provided that no such assignment shall
relieve the Purchaser from any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

Section 9.6 No Third Party Beneficiaries

 

Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon any third party other than any Indemnified Party,
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns any right,
remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.7 Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
substantive laws of the Province of Ontario, without giving effect to any
choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the
application of the law of any jurisdiction other than the Province of
Ontario.

Section 9.8 Jurisdiction and Consent to Service

 

Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: (a) agrees that any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or any of the
Contemplated Transactions, whether based in contract, tort or any other legal
theory, shall be brought exclusively in any court located in the Province of
Ontario (and in the appropriate appellate courts therefrom); (b) consents and
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such action, suit
or proceeding; (c) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and agrees
not to assert any claim, defense or objection to the venue of such courts
(whether on the basis of _forum non conveniens_ or otherwise); (d) agrees that
it will not attempt the removal or transfer of any such action, suit or
proceeding to any other court; and (e) consents to service of process on such
party in the manner provided in Section 9.1 (provided that nothing in this
Section 9.8(e) shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by Applicable Law).

 



76 Section 9.9 Specific Performance

 

The parties agree that irreparable and ongoing damages, for which monetary
damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or otherwise were breached. Accordingly,
each party agrees that in the event of any actual or threatened breach of this
Agreement by the other party, the non-breaching party shall be entitled, in
addition to all other rights and remedies that it may have, to obtain
injunctive or other equitable relief (including a temporary restraining order,
a preliminary injunction and a final injunction) to prevent any actual or
threatened breach of any of such provisions and to enforce such provisions
specifically, without the necessity of posting a bond or other security or of
proving actual damages.

in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event that an
ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
