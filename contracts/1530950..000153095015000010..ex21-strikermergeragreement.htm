"Shareholder") own all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Company, which consist of shares of common stock, $10.00 par value per

Common Stock being the "Shares").

of the outstanding stock options (each an "Option") to purchase shares of

Company").

G. Collectively, the Acquired Companies are in the business of developing,

AGREEMENT

In consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement, each Party hereby agrees as
follows:

ARTICLE 1 - MERGER

1.1 The Merger. In accordance with, and subject to, the terms of this
Agreement and the MBCA, at the Merger Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge
with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation of
the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"), and the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub will thereupon cease.

1.2 Effective Time of the Merger. The Merger will become effective upon the
filing by the Company and Merger Sub of articles of merger (the "Articles of
Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota substantially
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 1.2 and in accordance with the
requirements of the MBCA or at such other subsequent date or time as Buyer and
the Company may agree and specify in the Articles of Merger in accordance with
the MBCA (the "Merger Effective Time"). The Merger shall be deemed to have
occurred at 12:01 a.m. (central time) on the day upon which the Merger
Effective Time occurs. Upon the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub will
execute the Articles of Merger, and the Company and Merger Sub will file the
Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota
pursuant to this Section 1.2.

1.3 Effects of the Merger. The Merger will have the effects set forth in the
MBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Merger Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will be vested in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, obligations and other liabilities of the Company
and Merger Sub will become the debts, obligations and other liabilities of the
Surviving Corporation.

1.4 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The articles of incorporation of the
Company as in effect immediately before the Merger Effective Time will, at the
Merger Effective Time, be amended to read in its entirety as set forth in
Exhibit 1.4 and incorporated herein by reference and, as so amended, will be
the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. The bylaws of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately before the Merger Effective Time will, at
the Merger Effective Time, be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by Applicable Law.

1.5 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately before the Merger Effective Time will be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation at the Merger Effective Time, until the earlier
of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of the
Company immediately before the Merger Effective Time will be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation at the Merger Effective Time, until the earlier of
their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

1.6 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any Person, the following will
occur:

(a) Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation Stock. Each share of common stock,
$0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
before the Merger Effective Time will automatically be converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of the Surviving
Corporation, which will be the only shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation issued and outstanding immediately after the Merger Effective
Time.

(b) Treatment of Shareholders' Shares. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately before the Merger Effective Time will automatically cease to exist
and cease to be outstanding and will automatically be converted into the right
to receive from, or as paid on behalf of, the Surviving Corporation the Per-
Share Net Merger Consideration, upon and subject to the terms herein. 

(c) Certain Definitions. The following terms have the following meanings:

(1) Per-Share Net Merger Consideration. "Per-Share Net Merger Consideration"
means the Per-Share Stock Merger Consideration plus an amount, in cash, equal
to the sum of:

(A) the Per-Share Cash Closing Consideration; plus

(B) the Per-Share Reconciliation Consideration; plus

(C) the Per-Share Sellers Expense Amount Consideration,

without interest on such sum (except to the extent expressly contemplated in
the Escrow Agreement), with such sum being payable as and at the times
(including following Closing) stated herein (including being subject to
adjustment as contemplated in Article 2).

(2) Per-Share Cash Closing Consideration. "Per-Share Cash Closing
Consideration" means an amount equal to the quotient of:

(A) (i) the Aggregate Net Closing Cash Consideration, plus (ii) the aggregate
exercise price of all Options; divided by

(B) the Number of Common Stock Equivalents.

(3) Per-Share Reconciliation Consideration. "Per-Share Reconciliation
Consideration" means an amount equal to the following:

(A) if Section 2.4(f)(1) applies (meaning that an Upward Reconciliation Amount
exists), then: (i)(x) the Upward Reconciliation Amount plus (y) the Post-
Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount disbursed to the Sellers under Section
2.4(f)(1) divided by (ii) the Number of Common Stock Equivalents;

(B) if Section 2.4(f)(2) applies (meaning that a Downward Reconciliation
Amount exists), then: (i) the portion of the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow
Amount, if any, disbursed to the Sellers under Section 2.4(f)(2) divided by
(ii) the Number of Common Stock Equivalents; or

(C) if Section 2.4(f)(3) applies (meaning that neither an Upward
Reconciliation Amount nor Downward Reconciliation Amount exists), then: (i)
the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount disbursed to the Sellers under
Section 2.4(f)(3) divided by (ii) the Number of Common Stock Equivalents.

(4) Per-Share Sellers Expense Amount Consideration. "Per-Share Sellers Expense
Amount Consideration" means an amount equal to:

(A) the aggregate portion of the Sellers Expense Amount disbursed to the
Sellers (if any); divided by

(B) the Number of Common Stock Equivalents;

provided, however, that if more than one of such disbursements occurs, then
the foregoing will be calculated at the time of each such disbursement and
"Per-Share Sellers Expense Amount Consideration" will mean the sum, without
duplication, of all the results of all such calculations.

(5) Number of Common Stock Equivalents. "Number of Common Stock Equivalents"
means the sum of the following, without duplication: 

(A) the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately before the Merger Effective Time; plus

(B) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to issuance pursuant to
all Options immediately before the Merger Effective Time.

(6) Per-Share Stock Merger Consideration. "Per-Share Stock Merger
Consideration" means an amount equal to the quotient of:

(A) the Stock Merger Consideration; divided by

(B) the Number of Common Stock Equivalents.

(7) Per-Share Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount. "Per-Share Post-Closing
Adjustment Escrow Amount" means an amount equal to the quotient of:

(A) the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount; divided by

(B) the Number of Common Stock Equivalents.

1.7 Dissenting Shares. Upon execution of the Shareholders' Unanimous Written
Consent, which the Company shall deliver to Buyer as provided in Section 5.18,
no Shareholder shall be entitled to dissenters rights pursuant to the relevant
provisions of Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA.

1.8 Letters of Transmittal; Option Cancellation Agreement; PSR Cancellation
Agreements.

(a) Letters of Transmittal. Promptly after the Signing Date, the Company will
provide to each Shareholder a letter of transmittal, each substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit 1.8(a), for effecting the surrender of stock
certificates representing Shares and payment and delivery of the applicable
portion of the Per-Share Net Merger Consideration to which the holders of such
certificates are entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(b) (each a "Letter of
Transmittal").

(b) Option Cancellation Agreement. The Company has received from the Optionee
an option cancellation agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 1.8(b), for cancelling the Options in accordance with Section 1.13 in
exchange for payment and delivery of the applicable portion of the Per-Share
Net Merger Consideration, as provided herein (the "Option Cancellation
Agreement").

(c) PSR Cancellation Agreement. The Company will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from each PSR Holder a phantom stock rights cancellation
agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 1.8(c), for
cancelling the PSRs in accordance with Section 1.14 (each a "PSR Cancellation
Agreement").

1.9 Payment of Per-Share Net Merger Consideration. If, at or after the Merger
Effective Time, any stock certificate representing a Share converted as
provided in Section 1.6(b) is presented and surrendered to the Surviving
Corporation, together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal, then within
two Business Days after such presentment and surrender (unless such
presentment and surrender is at Closing, in which case then on the Closing
Date):

(a) Buyer and the Sellers' Representative will, with respect to each Share
represented thereby, cause the Paying/Escrow Agent to distribute to the Person
in whose name such stock certificate is registered, from the Aggregate Net
Closing Cash Consideration Payment Amount, the Per-Share Cash Closing
Consideration (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in
Section 2.5) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified in the Letter of Transmittal with respect to such Shares; and Buyer
will instruct the Buyer's transfer agent to issue the Per-Share Stock Merger
Consideration in book-entry form to the Person in whose name such stock
certificate is registered; and 

(b) the Person in whose name such stock certificate is registered will have
the right to receive, with respect to each such Share represented thereby, the
Per-Share Reconciliation Consideration and Per-Share Sellers Expense Amount
Consideration to the extent existing and determined from time to time (with
respect to the Sellers Expense Amount, as and when any remainder thereof is
subsequently disbursed to the Paying/Escrow Agent).

1.10 Lost Certificates. In the case of any lost, stolen or destroyed stock
certificate representing Shares, the holder thereof will be required (unless
such obligation is waived by Buyer), as a condition precedent to the delivery
to such holder of the consideration described herein, to deliver to the
Company a written affidavit and indemnity agreement in form and substance
acceptable to the Company and Buyer acting reasonably as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Buyer or the Company with respect to such stock
certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

1.11 Withholding Rights. The Surviving Corporation, Buyer or the Paying/Escrow
Agent, as the case may be, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person
(including to withhold and deduct from the amount payable to such Person at
Closing any required amount attributable to payments into escrow at Closing on
behalf of such Person) such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and
withhold, or as it is required by Applicable Law to pay Tax on behalf of such
Person, with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of Applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts will be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to such Person by the Surviving Corporation, Buyer or the Paying/Escrow
Agent, as applicable.

1.12 No Further Ownership Rights or Transfers. At and after the Merger
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation will be
closed with respect to the capital stock of the Company, and there will be no
further registration of transfers of the capital stock of the Company
thereafter on the records of the Surviving Corporation. Until surrendered with
a duly executed Letter of Transmittal as contemplated by Section 1.9, each
stock certificate representing Shares converted as provided in Section 1.6(b)
will be deemed, at and after the Merger Effective Time, to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Per-Share Net Merger Consideration,
subject to the terms contained in this Agreement.

1.13 Cancellation of Options.

(a) Treatment of Options. Each outstanding Option previously granted, whether
or not then vested or exercisable (but to the extent not previously
exercised), may not be exercised and will instead be canceled at the Merger
Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive upon execution and
delivery of the Option Cancellation Agreement in respect of such Option:

(1) payment, in accordance with Section 1.13(b), of consideration equal to the
amount (if any), for each share of Common Stock covered by such canceled
Option, by which the Per‑Share Cash Closing Consideration exceeds the
applicable exercise price per share of Common Stock covered by such Option
plus delivery, in accordance with Section 1.13(b), of the Per-Share Stock
Merger Consideration, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as
provided in Section 2.5; and

(2) the right to receive, with respect to each share of Common Stock covered
by such canceled Option, the Per-Share Reconciliation Consideration and Per-
Share Sellers Expense Amount Consideration to the extent existing and
determined from time to time, whether already disbursed to the Sellers by or
on behalf of the Buyer (or, with respect to the Sellers Expense Amount, as and
when any remainder thereof is subsequently disbursed to the Paying/Escrow
Agent).

All of the foregoing will be subject to the terms of this Agreement, including
that such payment of consideration will be made at the times and subject to
the conditions hereunder.

(b) Payment to Optionee. At Closing and on the Closing Date, (i) Buyer will
deposit with the Company for the benefit of and for payment or delivery to the
Optionee, as the case may be, in accordance with this Section 1.13, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by the
Company to Buyer on 

or before the Closing Date, for each share of Common Stock covered by an
Option, an amount equal to (1) the Per‑Share Cash Closing Consideration
(together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.5)
minus (2) the applicable exercise price per share of such Common Stock covered
by such Option; and (ii) for each share of Common Stock covered by an Option,
Buyer will instruct the Buyer's transfer agent to issue the Per-Share Stock
Merger Consideration in book-entry form to the Optionee. To the extent not
previously paid (including if paid by an Acquired Company in connection with
Closing by providing physical checks or other payment as part of the Closing
process, which the Company may do or cause to be done in consultation with
Buyer, subject to applicable Tax withholding), promptly after Closing (but in
no event later than the first regular payroll date of the Surviving
Corporation (or its applicable Affiliate) following the Closing Date) Buyer
will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to the Optionee, through the
Surviving Corporation's (or its applicable Affiliate's) payroll system, for
each Option, an amount equal to (subject to Section 1.11) (1)(A) the Per‑Share
Cash Closing Consideration (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as
provided in Section 2.5) minus (B) the applicable exercise price per share of
such Common Stock covered by such Option, and minus (C) applicable Tax
withholding; and (2) the Per-Share Stock Merger Consideration (in the manner
set forth in clause (ii) above). For payments made, if any, to the Optionee
pursuant to Section 2.4(f) or other provisions of this Agreement on a date
after the Closing Date (including payments of any additional portion of the
Per‑Share Net Merger Consideration), Buyer will promptly make such payments in
a manner (including through the Surviving Corporation or its applicable
Affiliate, if applicable, or their applicable payroll system) that ensures
proper Tax withholding and information reporting, as required by Applicable
Law and, subject to the foregoing, to ensure that payments are paid on the
same schedule and under the same terms and conditions as apply to payments to
Shareholders generally. The employer portion of any employment Taxes imposed
on any of the Acquired Companies with respect to amounts paid pursuant to this
Section 1.13(b) will be treated as Pre-Closing Taxes for purposes of this
Agreement.

1.14 Cancellation of PSRs. At Closing and on the Closing Date, Buyer will
deposit with the Company, for the benefit of and for payment to each PSR
Holder that has executed a PSR Cancellation Agreement, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by the Company to Buyer
on or before the Closing Date, for each share of Common Stock used for
measurement pursuant to such PSR, an amount in cash equal to (subject to
Section 1.11) the sum of (i) the Per‑Share Cash Closing Consideration, plus
(ii) the Per-Share Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount, plus (iii) the
product of "A" multiplied by "B" (the "Buyer Average Price"), where "A" equals
the Per-Share Stock Merger Consideration, and where "B" equals the volume-
weighted average sale price for a share of Buyer Common Stock on the New York
Stock Exchange for the period of 10 consecutive trading days ending at the end
of the second trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date, less, in
each of clause (i), (ii) and (iii), applicable Tax withholding. To the extent
not previously paid (including if paid by an Acquired Company in connection
with Closing by providing physical checks or other payment as part of the
Closing process, which the Company may do or cause to be done in consultation
with Buyer, subject to applicable Tax withholding), promptly after Closing
(but in no event later than the first regular payroll date of the Surviving
Corporation (or its applicable Affiliate) following the Closing Date), Buyer
will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each such PSR Holder, through
the Surviving Corporation's (or its applicable Affiliate's) payroll system,
for each share of Common Stock used for measurement pursuant to such PSR, an
amount in cash equal to (subject to Section 1.11) the sum of (i) the Per‑Share
Cash Closing Consideration, plus (ii) the Per-Share Post-Closing Adjustment
Escrow Amount, plus (iii) the Buyer Average Price, less, in each of clause
(i), (ii) and (iii), applicable Tax withholding. The amounts payable under the
PSR Cancellation Agreements are Transaction Expenses for purposes of this
Agreement. The employer portion of any employment Taxes imposed on any of the
Acquired Companies with respect to amounts paid pursuant to this Section 1.14
will be treated as Pre-Closing Taxes for purposes of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 2 - MERGER CONSIDERATION, ADJUSTMENTS AND RECONCILIATION

2.1 Merger Consideration. Upon and subject to the terms herein, the total
aggregate consideration payable by Buyer and Merger Sub in connection with the
Merger (the "Merger Consideration") will be (a) 2,454,425 shares of Buyer
Common Stock (the "Stock Merger Consideration") plus (b) the amount of
$1,050,000,000 (the "Initial Cash Merger Consideration"), as such Initial Cash
Merger Consideration is adjusted pursuant to the terms herein. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that Schedule 2.1 sets forth an illustration of the
calculation of the Merger Consideration (including the various components and
line items of Net Working Capital, Cash, Funded Indebtedness, Transaction
Expenses and Pre-Closing Taxes) assuming that the Closing Date had occurred on
December 27, 2014. 

2.2 Calculation of Estimated Cash Merger Consideration for Closing; Payoff
Letters. On or before the third Business Day before the Closing Date, the
Company will deliver to Buyer a statement containing, in reasonable detail,
the Company's good faith reasonable estimate of: (a) Net Working Capital,
Cash, Funded Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and Pre-Closing Taxes; and (b)
the estimated cash portion of the Merger Consideration (which estimated cash
portion of the Merger Consideration, for Closing, will be "X" plus "Y" minus
"Z", where "X" equals (1) the Initial Cash Merger Consideration plus any
amount by which such estimated Net Working Capital exceeds Target Net Working
Capital, (2) the Initial Cash Merger Consideration, if such estimated Net
Working Capital equals Target Net Working Capital, or (3) the Initial Cash
Merger Consideration minus any amount by which such estimated Net Working
Capital is less than Target Net Working Capital, as applicable, where "Y"
equals the amount of Cash, and where "Z" equals the Pre-Closing Taxes (the
amount of the estimated cash portion of the Merger Consideration as determined
pursuant to this Section 2.2, the "Estimated Cash Merger Consideration")).
Buyer shall be entitled to review, comment on and request reasonable changes
to the amount and calculation of the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration, and
the Company shall consult and confer with Buyer and consider in good faith any
comments made by Buyer with respect to the amount and calculation of the
Estimated Cash Merger Consideration prior to the Closing Date. In the event
that Buyer and the Company cannot mutually determine the amount of the
Estimated Cash Merger Consideration within two Business Days after Buyer's
receipt of the Company's amount and calculation of the Estimated Cash Merger
Consideration, the Parties agree that the Company's then‑proposed amount and
calculation of the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration will be the Estimated
Cash Merger Consideration at Closing for all purposes hereunder. On or before
the third Business Day before the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Buyer payoff letters, in customary form, from each of the holders of Funded
Indebtedness (the "Payoff Letters"), each of which shall (i) state the total
amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all principal, interest,
prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs or similar obligations and all
fees, costs and expenses under the applicable Contracts evidencing such Funded
Indebtedness as of the anticipated Closing Date (and the daily accrual
thereafter), together with appropriate wire instructions, (ii) state that upon
receipt of the applicable payoff amounts, the applicable Contracts evidencing
such Funded Indebtedness shall be irrevocably terminated, and (iii) state that
all Encumbrances and all guarantees in connection therewith relating to the
assets and properties of the Acquired Companies securing any such Funded
Indebtedness shall be, upon the payment of the applicable payoff amounts on
the Closing Date, released and terminated. On or before the third Business Day
before the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a schedule setting
forth the portion of the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration and the number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock payable or deliverable, as applicable, to each
Shareholder and the Optionee, and the payment to be made to each PSR Holder
pursuant to Section 1.14, together with wire transfer instructions for each
such Person.

2.3 Payment of Estimated Merger Consideration and Related Payments. Upon and
subject to the terms herein, the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration will be
paid as follows:

(a) At Closing and on the Closing Date, upon and subject to the terms herein,
the following will occur:

(1) Buyer will deposit into escrow with the Paying/Escrow Agent, the amount of
$25,000,000 (the "Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount"), to be held by the
Paying/Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement;

(2) Buyer will, on behalf of the Sellers, deposit into an account that
Sellers' Representative designates in writing on or before the Closing Date,
the amount of $500,000 (the "Sellers Expense Amount"), to be held by Sellers'
Representative pursuant to the terms hereof;

(3) Buyer, on the applicable Acquired Company's behalf, will pay each of the
obligations necessary to satisfy all Funded Indebtedness as of immediately
before Closing as provided in the Payoff Letters, which amounts shall be
treated as Merger Consideration paid by Buyer (such amount, the "Estimated
Funded Indebtedness"); and

(4) Buyer, on the applicable Acquired Company's behalf, will (i) pay all
unpaid Transaction Expenses as of immediately before Closing to the extent
determinable at Closing and to the extent due and payable at Closing
(including, for avoidance of doubt, attorneys', accountants', investment
bankers' 

and other professionals' and third parties' fees and expenses), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts that the Company
designates in writing on or before the Closing Date, and (ii) pay or otherwise
satisfy in accordance with their respective terms after the Closing Date all
other Transaction Expenses, all of which shall be treated as Merger
Consideration paid by Buyer (such amount, the "Estimated Transaction
Expenses").

"Aggregate Net Closing Cash Consideration" means the remaining balance of the
Estimated Cash Merger Consideration, after deducting the payments and other
amounts described in the preceding clauses of this Section 2.3(a). On the
Closing Date, Buyer will wire transfer to (a) the Paying/Escrow Agent
immediately available funds in an amount equal to the portion of the Aggregate
Net Closing Cash Consideration payable to the Shareholders hereunder (the
"Aggregate Net Closing Cash Consideration Payment Amount"), to be distributed
by the Paying/Escrow Agent to the Shareholders pursuant to the terms hereof
and the Escrow Agreement, and (b) the Company immediately available funds in
an amount equal to the portion of the Aggregate Net Closing Cash Consideration
payable to the Optionee hereunder, to be distributed by the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to the terms hereof.

(b) At or following, as applicable, the Merger Effective Time, Buyer will upon
and subject to the terms herein (including Section 1.9, 1.11, 1.13 and 1.14)
(i) together with the Sellers' Representative, instruct the Paying/Escrow
Agent to disburse to each Shareholder that has executed and delivered a Letter
of Transmittal the applicable portions of the Aggregate Net Closing Cash
Consideration and the Stock Merger Consideration to which each such
Shareholder is entitled hereunder, (ii) pay or cause the Surviving Corporation
to pay (or together with the Sellers' Representative instruct the
Paying/Escrow Agent to pay) to the Optionee so long as he has executed and
delivered the Option Cancellation Agreement the applicable portions of the
Aggregate Net Closing Cash Consideration and the Stock Merger Consideration to
which the Optionee is entitled hereunder, and (iii) pay or cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to each PSR Holder that has executed and delivered a PSR
Cancellation Agreement the payments described in Section 1.14, it being
understood that no amounts will be paid to any Shareholder unless and until
such Shareholder has executed a Letter of Transmittal, to the Optionee unless
and until the Optionee has executed the Option Cancellation Agreement or to
any PSR Holder unless and until such PSR Holder has executed a PSR
Cancellation Agreement.

2.4 Merger Consideration Adjustment and Reconciliation. Each Party will
assist and cooperate with each other and each other's representatives in all
reasonable respects in connection with the matters in this Section 2.4,
including giving each other and such representatives reasonable access upon
reasonable notice at all reasonable times to the applicable personnel,
properties, books and records of the Acquired Companies for such matters
(except that no Party will be required to give access to or otherwise disclose
any information if such access or disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-
client or other privilege or contravene any Applicable Law).

(a) Buyer's Preparation of the Statement. Within 90 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer will prepare and deliver to Sellers' Representative a statement
(the "Statement") stating, in reasonable detail, Buyer's determination of (1)
Net Working Capital and Cash, (2) the Transaction Expenses as of Closing, (3)
the Funded Indebtedness as of Closing, and (4) the Pre-Closing Taxes. The
final determination of Net Working Capital and Cash pursuant to this Section
2.4 is the "Final Net Working Capital and Cash." The final determination of
the Transaction Expenses as of the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.4 is the
"Final Transaction Expenses." The final determination of the Funded
Indebtedness as of the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.4 is the "Final
Funded Indebtedness." The final determination of the Pre-Closing Taxes
pursuant to this Section 2.4 is the "Final Pre-Closing Taxes."

(b) Sellers' Representative's Response to the Statement. The Net Working
Capital and Cash, the Transaction Expenses as of the Closing, and the Funded
Indebtedness as of Closing and the Pre-Closing Taxes as set forth in the
Statement will become final and binding (and become Final Net Working Capital
and Cash, Final Transaction Expenses, Final Funded Indebtedness and Final Pre-
Closing Taxes) 45 days after Buyer gives the Statement to Sellers'
Representative, unless Sellers' Representative gives written notice, in
reasonable detail, of disagreement therewith (a "Notice of Disagreement") to
Buyer at or before the end of such 45-day period. If Sellers' Representative
gives a Notice of Disagreement at or before the end of such 45-day period,
then Final Net Working Capital and Cash, Final Transaction Expenses, Final
Funded Indebtedness and Final Pre-Closing Taxes (as finally determined in
accordance with the following clause (b)(1) or (b)(2)) will become final and
binding upon the earlier of (1) the date 

Sellers' Representative and Buyer resolve in writing all remaining differences
they have with respect to Final Net Working Capital and Cash, Final
Transaction Expenses, Final Funded Indebtedness and Final Pre-Closing Taxes or
(2) the date all remaining disputed items are finally resolved in writing by
the Arbitrator pursuant to Section 2.4(c). Buyer will not modify the Statement
(after it is delivered) in any manner adverse to Sellers (including by later
raising any new item not reflected in the Statement). Sellers' Representative
will not modify the Notice of Disagreement (after such notice is given) in any
manner adverse to Buyer (including by later raising any new item not reflected
in the Notice of Disagreement). Any item or amount in, or omitted from, the
Statement that Sellers' Representative does not disagree with in the Notice of
Disagreement will be final and binding in the manner stated in, or omitted
from, the Statement.

(c) Resolving Matters in Disagreement. During the 30‑day period after a Notice
of Disagreement is given, Sellers' Representative and Buyer will attempt to
resolve in writing any differences that they have regarding Final Net Working
Capital and Cash, Final Transaction Expenses, Final Funded Indebtedness and
Final Pre-Closing Taxes. If, at the end of such 30‑day period, Sellers'
Representative and Buyer have not reached agreement on all such differences,
then either Sellers' Representative or Buyer may require that the items that
remain in dispute be promptly submitted to an arbitrator (the "Arbitrator")
for review and resolution. Buyer and Sellers' Representative agree that the
Arbitrator will be a nationally recognized public accounting firm agreed upon
by Sellers' Representative and Buyer in writing, except that, unless otherwise
agreed by Buyer and Sellers' Representative, the Arbitrator will not be an
accounting firm used by any Party (or any Affiliate of any Party) within the
preceding two years for any purpose. If Sellers' Representative and Buyer
cannot agree upon an Arbitrator within 10 Business Days after the end of the
30-day period described above, then the Arbitrator will be selected by lot
from a list of four eligible potential Arbitrators remaining after Sellers'
Representative nominates three in writing to Buyer within such 10-Business Day
period, Buyer nominates three in writing to Sellers' Representative within
such 10-Business Day period, and Sellers' Representative and Buyer each
eliminate one potential Arbitrator from the other's nominations in writing
delivered to the other within five Business Days after receipt of the other's
proposed Arbitrators (and if Sellers' Representative and Buyer are unable to
engage such proposed Arbitrator within a reasonable period thereafter,
including if such proposed Arbitrator is unwilling to take such engagement,
then the forgoing will repeat until an Arbitrator is so engaged). If Buyer or
Sellers' Representative fails to nominate Arbitrators or eliminate one of the
other's proposed Arbitrators by written notice delivered within the foregoing
time periods, then the Party who complied with such obligations may designate
the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator will determine procedures for such arbitration,
subject to the terms hereof. The Arbitrator will only consider the items that
remain in dispute. The Arbitrator will not assign a value to any item that is
greater than the greater value for such item claimed by Sellers'
Representative or Buyer or less than the lesser value for such item claimed by
Sellers' Representative or Buyer. The Arbitrator will determine Final Net
Working Capital and Cash, Final Transaction Expenses, Final Funded
Indebtedness and Final Pre-Closing Taxes solely based on submissions made by
Sellers' Representative and Buyer, and the Arbitrator's determination of Final
Net Working Capital and Cash, Final Transaction Expenses, Final Funded
Indebtedness and Final Pre-Closing Taxes must be consistent with the terms of
this Agreement. The Arbitrator will render a decision resolving such items in
dispute within 30 days after completion of submissions to the Arbitrator.

(d) Allocation of Fees and Expenses. The Non‑Prevailing Party in such
arbitration will pay its own and its Affiliates' fees and expenses incurred
with respect to such arbitration and will also pay a fraction of the sum of:
(1) the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator; plus (2) the reasonable out of
pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of the
Prevailing Party and its Affiliates incurred with respect to such arbitration.
Such fraction will be determined as follows: (A) its numerator will be an
amount equal to the difference between the Non‑Prevailing Party's
determination of the items in dispute (in the aggregate and as submitted to
the Arbitrator) and the Arbitrator's determination of such items; and (B) its
denominator will be an amount equal to the difference between Sellers'
Representative's and Buyer's respective determinations of such items (in the
aggregate and as submitted to the Arbitrator). The Prevailing Party will pay
the remainder of the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator and the remainder of
the Prevailing Party's and its Affiliates' fees and expenses. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Arbitrator's determination of such items in dispute is
exactly midway between Sellers' Representative's and Buyer's determination of
such items, then Sellers' Representative and Buyer each will pay one-half of
the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator (and otherwise will pay its own and
its Affiliates' fees and expenses as described above). Sellers (considered as
one Party for this purpose, with Sellers' Representative acting on their
behalf as contemplated herein) or Buyer is the 

"Prevailing Party" if the Arbitrator's determination of such items is closer
to such Party's determination of such items than it is to such other Party's
determination of such items (in each case in the aggregate and as submitted to
the Arbitrator). Sellers (considered as one Party for this purpose, with
Sellers' Representative acting on their behalf as contemplated herein) or
Buyer is the "Non‑Prevailing Party" if the other is the Prevailing Party.

(e) Adjustment to Cash Portion of Merger Consideration Based on Final Net
Working Capital and Cash. The cash portion of the Merger Consideration will
be, and automatically will be adjusted to be, the Estimated Cash Merger
Consideration, (1) increased by the amount, if any, by which the amount of the
Net Working Capital included in the Final Net Working Capital and Cash exceeds
the estimated Net Working Capital included in the Estimated Cash Merger
Consideration, (2) decreased by the amount, if any, by which the amount of the
Net Working Capital included in the Final Net Working Capital and Cash is less
than the estimated Net Working Capital included in the Estimated Cash Merger
Consideration, (3) increased by the amount, if any, by which the amount of
Cash included in the Final Net Working Capital and Cash exceeds the estimated
Cash included in the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration, (4) decreased by the
amount, if any, by which the amount of Cash included in the Final Net Working
Capital and Cash is less than the estimated Cash included in the Estimated
Cash Merger Consideration, (5) increased by the amount, if any, by which the
amount of the Final Pre-Closing Taxes is less than the estimated Pre-Closing
Taxes included in the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration, and (6) decreased
by the amount, if any, by which the amount of the Final Pre-Closing Taxes
exceeds the estimated Pre-Closing Taxes included in the Estimated Cash Merger
Consideration. However, if no such adjustment is required pursuant to this
Section 2.4(e), then the cash portion of the Merger Consideration will equal
the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration.

(f) Reconciliation Payment. Within five Business Days after Final Net Working
Capital and Cash, Final Transaction Expenses, Final Funded Indebtedness and
Final Pre-Closing Taxes become final and binding, the following will occur
(with the payments in this Section 2.4(f) being made without interest by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, and with any amount paid or disbursed
to the Sellers under the following being allocated among the applicable
Sellers as contemplated in Article 1).

(1) If the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration (as determined at Closing),
minus (x) the amount, if any, by which the amount of Transaction Expenses
included in the Final Transaction Expenses exceeds the Estimated Transaction
Expenses minus (y) the amount, if any, by which the amount of Funded
Indebtedness included in the Final Funded Indebtedness exceeds the Estimated
Funded Indebtedness, is less than the cash portion of the Merger Consideration
(as adjusted, if at all, under Section 2.4(e)) (with the amount by which such
calculation is less than such cash portion of the Merger Consideration being
the "Upward Reconciliation Amount"), then the following will occur:

(A) Buyer will pay, or cause to be paid, to the Paying/Escrow Agent pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement an amount equal to the Upward Reconciliation Amount,
and Buyer and the Sellers' Representative will instruct the Paying/Escrow
Agent to disburse such amounts to the Sellers (or to the Surviving Corporation
with respect to the portion of such amount payable to the Optionee) pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement (provided that each Seller must have theretofore
delivered his, her or its Letter of Transmittal in order to receive such
distribution); and

(B) Buyer and the Sellers' Representative will cause an amount equal to the
Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount to be disbursed to the Sellers (or to
the Surviving Corporation with respect to the portion of such amount payable
to the Optionee, solely in his capacity as Optionee) pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement (provided that each Seller must have theretofore delivered his, her
or its Letter of Transmittal in order to receive such distribution).

(2) If the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration (as determined at Closing)
minus (x) the amount, if any, by which the amount of Transaction Expenses
included in the Final Transaction Expenses exceeds the Estimated Transaction
Expenses minus (y) the amount, if any, by which the amount of Funded
Indebtedness included in the Final Funded Indebtedness exceeds the cash
portion of the Merger Consideration (as adjusted, if at all, under Section
2.4(e)) (with the amount by which such calculation exceeds such cash 

portion of the Merger Consideration being the "Downward Reconciliation
Amount"), then the following will occur:

(A) the Parties will cause a disbursement of all or a portion of the Post-
Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount to Buyer or the Surviving Corporation (as
Buyer determines) to the extent necessary to pay the Downward Reconciliation
Amount, provided that the sole source of the Downward Reconciliation Amount
will be from the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount and Buyer will have no
other recourse if the Downward Reconciliation Amount exceeds the Post-Closing
Adjustment Escrow Amount; and

(B) if any portion of the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount is not
disbursed under clause (f)(2)(A) above, then Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative will cause an amount equal to such undisbursed portion of the
Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount to be disbursed to the Sellers (or to
the Surviving Corporation with respect to the portion of such amount payable
to the Optionee, solely in his capacity as Optionee) pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement (provided that each Seller must have theretofore delivered his, her
or its Letter of Transmittal in order to receive such distribution).

(3) If the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration (as determined at Closing)
minus (x) the amount, if any, by which the amount of Transaction Expenses
included in the Final Transaction Expenses exceeds the Estimated Transaction
Expenses minus (y) the amount, if any, by which the amount of Funded
Indebtedness included in the Final Funded Indebtedness equals the cash portion
of the Merger Consideration (as adjusted, if at all, under Section 2.4(e)),
then Buyer and the Sellers' Representative will cause an amount equal to the
Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount to be disbursed to the Sellers (or to
the Surviving Corporation with respect to the portion of such amount payable
to the Optionee, solely in his capacity as Optionee) pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement (provided that each Seller must have theretofore delivered his, her
or its Letter of Transmittal in order to receive such distribution).

(g) Target Net Working Capital Defined. "Target Net Working Capital" means the
amount of $76,091,000.

(h) Net Working Capital and Cash Defined; Physical Inventory. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that Schedule 2.4(h) sets forth an illustration of the
calculation of Net Working Capital (including the various components and line
items of Net Working Capital) assuming that the Closing Date had occurred on
December 27, 2014. "Net Working Capital" means an amount equal to (x) current
assets of the Acquired Companies (other than Cash) in the categories set forth
on Schedule 2.4(h) on a consolidated basis minus (y) current liabilities of
the Acquired Companies in the categories set forth on Schedule 2.4(h) on a
consolidated basis, in each case determined as of the NWC Effective Time and
in accordance with GAAP, as consistently applied in the preparation of the
Interim Balance Sheet, except as set forth on Schedule 2.4(h). Whether or not
the date as of which Net Working Capital is required to be calculated
coincides with a fiscal year-end of the Company on a consolidated basis, the
Parties will use customary fiscal year-end closing procedures for the
calculation thereof, including procedures with respect to accounts and
adjustments. "Cash" means the sum of the fair market value (expressed in
United States dollars) of all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
of the Acquired Companies as of the NWC Effective Time, determined in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied (for avoidance of doubt, Cash shall
be calculated net of issued but uncleared checks and drafts and shall include
checks actually received by the Company or its banks whether or not cleared).
For purposes of calculating the Net Working Capital included in the Final Net
Working Capital and Cash, on or not more than seven (7) calendar days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall take a physical count of the inventory of
the Acquired Companies, and Buyer and its representatives shall be permitted
to observe such physical count. The count shall be adjusted for activity
between the date of the physical inventory and the Closing Date. For purposes
of counting and calculating the value of the inventory of the Acquired
Companies for purposes of determining the Final Net Working Capital and Cash,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall use the accounting
methods, practices, principles, policies and procedures, with consistent
judgments and valuation and estimation methodologies that were used in the
preparation of the annual financial statements for the most recent fiscal
year-end as if such inventory was being audited as of the fiscal year-end. 

(i) Allocation of Merger Consideration. Each Party will allocate the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Schedule 2.4(i) and Applicable Law (including
that Buyer will cause each Acquired Company to do so). As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Final Net Working Capital and Cash becomes final and
binding, but in any event within 20 days thereafter, Buyer will deliver to
Sellers' Representative a draft allocation of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Schedule 2.4(i) (the "Allocation"). Sellers' Representative
will have the right to review the Allocation and will notify Buyer in writing
of any objections within 20 days after receipt of the Allocation. Buyer and
Sellers' Representative will cooperate in good faith to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts, if any. If Buyer and Sellers' Representative are
unable to reach an agreement regarding the Allocation, then within 30 days
following receipt by Buyer of Sellers' Representative's written objections,
any disagreement will be resolved by the Arbitrator (to be selected as
provided in Section 2.4(c) in the event not theretofore selected) whose
involvement will be limited solely to disputed items. Any Allocation
determined pursuant to the decision of the Arbitrator will incorporate,
reflect and be consistent with Schedule 2.4(i). The Allocation, as prepared by
Buyer if no timely written objection by Sellers' Representative has been
given, as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between Buyer and Sellers'
Representative or as determined by the Arbitrator (the "Final Allocation"),
will be final and binding on the Parties. Any fees and expenses of the
Arbitrator will be borne by Buyer and Sellers using the same method of
allocation described in Section 2.4(d). After Closing, the Parties will, and
will cause their respective Affiliates to, make consistent use of the Final
Allocation, as adjusted to reflect any, if any, adjustments to the Merger
Consideration, for all Tax purposes. With respect to such Final Allocation, as
so adjusted, each Party will (1) be bound by such allocation, (2) act in
accordance with such allocation in the preparation of all financial statements
and the filing of all Tax Returns and in the course of any Tax audit, Tax
review or other Tax Proceeding relating thereto, and (3) take no position and
cause its Affiliates to take no position inconsistent with such allocation for
Tax purposes (including in connection with any Proceeding), unless in each
case otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
section 1313(a) of the Code.

2.5 Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip or shares of Buyer Common
Stock representing fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock or book-entry
credit of the same shall be issued as part of the Per-Share Net Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of
a shareholder of Buyer or a holder of shares of Buyer Common Stock.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each holder of
Shares or Options exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock (after
taking into account all Shares or Options held by such holder) shall receive,
in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of
(i) such fractional part of a share of Buyer Common Stock multiplied by (ii)
the closing price for a share of Buyer Common Stock on The New York Stock
Exchange on the last trading day immediately preceding the Merger Effective
Time.

2.6 Restricted Securities. The issuance of the shares of Buyer Common Stock
comprising Stock Merger Consideration shall not be registered under the
Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws, and such shares of
Buyer Common Stock shall be "restricted securities" under the Securities Act.
The shares of Buyer Common Stock comprising the Stock Merger Consideration
shall be in book-entry form only and shall include a legend or other stop
transfer notations in substance as follows:

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), OR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS
OF ANY STATES. THESE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY
AND RESALE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR RESOLD EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THE
ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR
EXEMPTION THEREFROM, AS WELL AS RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND OTHER PROVISIONS
CONTAINED IN THE INVESTOR QUESTIONNAIRE AND LOCK-UP AGREEMENT EXECUTED BY THE
REGISTERED HOLDER OF THESE SECURITIES." 

ARTICLE 3 - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule and subject to Sections
8.2 and 9.11, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer and Merger
Sub as follows in this Article 3:

3.1 Organization and Good Standing. Each Acquired Company is a duly organized
and validly existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it was organized, each as is listed in Schedule 3.1.
Each Acquired Company is duly qualified and in good standing to do business as
a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or leasing
of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, with each such jurisdiction (if any) being listed in Schedule
3.1, except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Acquired
Company has full corporate power and authority to own and lease its properties
and assets and conduct its business as now conducted. Except for the Company's
ownership of the Company Subsidiaries, no Acquired Company holds, directly or
indirectly, of record or beneficially, any equity interest or the right to
acquire any equity interest in any other Person. The Company has provided to
Buyer a true, correct and complete copy of the Organizational Documents of
each Acquired Company. No Acquired Company is in material violation of any
provision of any of its Organizational Documents.

3.2 Capitalization. Schedule 3.2 lists (a) all authorized equity interests of
each Acquired Company, (b) all issued and outstanding equity interests of each
Acquired Company, and (c) the names of the holders of record and beneficial
interests and the number of issued and outstanding equity interests of each
Acquired Company held by each such holder. The equity interests held, directly
or indirectly, by the Company of the Company Subsidiaries, are all of the
outstanding equity interests of such Acquired Companies. All of the issued and
outstanding equity interests of each Acquired Company are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non‑assessable, and no such equity interests
are held in treasury. No equity interest of any Acquired Company was issued in
violation of any Organizational Document of such Acquired Company, any
Applicable Law, any Contract to which any Acquired Company is a party or
otherwise bound or any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal,
pre‑emptive right or subscription right (or other similar right) of any
Person. Except for restrictions imposed by securities laws applicable to

Stock and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment.

Except as disclosed in (x) the Buyer Disclosure Schedule and subject to

business requires such qualification, except as would not have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect. Buyer and Merger Sub each has full corporate power
and authority to own and lease its properties and assets and conduct its
business as now conducted. Buyer has provided to the Company a true, correct
and complete copy of the Organizational Documents of each of Buyer and Merger

exchange right or other security, Contract, commitment arrangement or
undertaking of any nature whereby any Person has, or has a right to receive,
any equity interest of, or right or obligation to acquire any equity interest

4.3 Authority and Authorization; Conflicts; Consents.

(a) Authority and Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and each applicable Transaction Document by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including Merger Sub) have been duly authorized and approved by
all necessary corporate action with respect to Buyer and each such Affiliate
of Buyer, and each such authorization and approval remains in full force and
effect. This Agreement has been, and each of the Transaction Documents of
Buyer and Merger Sub will be at or prior to the Closing, duly and validly
executed and delivered by Buyer and Merger Sub and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company and its applicable
Affiliates of this Agreement and each applicable Transaction Document of the
Company or any of its Affiliates, this Agreement is, and each Transaction
Document of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including Merger Sub) at Closing
will be, the legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer and each such
Affiliate of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer and each such Affiliate of Buyer
in accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability may be
limited by any Enforcement Limitation. Buyer and each such Affiliate of Buyer
has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement
and each Transaction Document to be executed and delivered by Buyer or such
Affiliate of Buyer and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein and
therein to be consummated by Buyer and each such Affiliate of Buyer.

(b) Conflicts. None of the execution or delivery by Buyer or Merger Sub of
this Agreement or by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer (including Merger Sub) of
any Transaction Document, the consummation by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer
(including Merger Sub) of the transactions contemplated herein or therein, or
compliance by Buyer or Merger Sub with any of the provisions hereof or thereof
does or will (with or without the passage of time or giving of notice): (1)
constitute a breach of, violate, conflict with or give rise to or create any
right or obligation under 

any Organizational Document of such Person; (2) violate any Applicable Law,
order or injunction with respect to any such Person; or (3) constitute a
breach or violation of or a default under, conflict with or give rise to or
create any right of any Person other than Buyer or Merger Sub to accelerate,

materially adverse to any Seller or any Acquired Company, except where such
breach, violation, default, conflict or right described in clause (b)(2) or
(b)(3) above will not materially and adversely affect Buyer's or Merger Sub's
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated herein.

(c) Consents. No consent or approval by, notification to or filing with any
Person is required in connection with Buyer's or Merger Sub's execution,

Affiliate's consummation of the transactions contemplated herein or therein,
except (1) filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Minnesota, (2) as required by the HSR Act, (3) as required by the
Exchange Act and filings or applications with The New York Stock Exchange or
(4) for any consents, approvals, notices or filings, the absence of which,
individually or in the aggregate, will not materially and adversely affect
Buyer's or Merger Sub's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
herein or therein.

4.4 Buyer SEC Reports; Financial Statements.

(a) Buyer SEC Reports. Buyer has filed with the SEC all forms, reports and
documents required to be filed by Buyer since September 30, 2013
(collectively, the "Buyer SEC Reports"). Buyer has previously delivered or
made available to the Company true and complete copies of all of the Buyer SEC
Reports that have been filed with the SEC before the Signing Date (and, for
these purposes, any Buyer SEC Reports that are available via the SEC's
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system are deemed to have
been delivered or made available to the Company). As of their respective
dates, the Buyer SEC Reports (including any Buyer SEC Reports filed after the
Signing Date until the Closing) (i) were prepared in all material respects in
accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder
applicable to such Buyer SEC Reports and (ii) did not at the time they were
filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of Buyer's
Subsidiaries is required to separately file any forms, reports or other
documents with the SEC. The chief executive officer and the chief financial
officer of Buyer have signed, and Buyer has filed with the SEC, all
certifications required by Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
such certifications contain no qualifications or exceptions to the matters
certified therein and have not been modified or withdrawn, and neither Buyer
nor any of its officers has received notice from any Governmental Authority
questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of
filing of such certifications. As used in this Section 4.4, the term "file"
shall be broadly construed to include any manner in which a document or
information is submitted to the SEC.

(b) Buyer Financial Statements. At the time they were filed with the SEC, the
consolidated financial statements of Buyer included in Buyer's annual report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 under the Exchange
Act complied in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements
and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as
then in effect, were prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly presented the consolidated financial position of Buyer and
its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended. Since the date of the
audited balance sheet of Buyer contained in Buyer's annual report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 (the "Buyer Balance Sheet"),
there has not been (i) any Buyer Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any material
change by Buyer in its accounting methods, principles or practices, except as
required by concurrent changes in GAAP, Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act
or Applicable Law, or (iii) any material revaluation by Buyer of any of its
assets, other than in Buyer's Ordinary Course of Business. As of the Merger
Effective Time, taking into account the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein, Buyer and each Subsidiary of Buyer will be solvent and
will be able to pay its debts in Buyer's or such Subsidiary's Ordinary Course
of Business, as applicable, as those debts become due and payable. 

(c) Undisclosed Liabilities. Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, do
not have any liabilities, obligations or commitments of any kind, whether
accrued, absolute, fixed or contingent, except for liabilities, obligations or
commitments (1) disclosed in, provided for, adequately reflected in, reserved
against or otherwise described in the Buyer SEC Reports or the Buyer Balance
Sheet (including in any note thereto), (2) under any Contract or under any
Plan of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, (3) that have arisen in the Ordinary
Course of Business of Buyer or such Subsidiary, as applicable, since the date
of the Buyer Balance Sheet (none of which will result from or relate to any
breach of Contract, breach of warranty, tort, infringement or violation of
Applicable Law), (4) that would not have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, (5)
under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein or (6) that are otherwise disclosed in this Agreement
(including the Buyer Disclosure Schedule).

(d) Absence of Certain Events.

(1) Since the Buyer Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any Event that has
had a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

(2) Except for items that have not had a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, or as
otherwise expressly contemplated herein, since the date of the Buyer Balance
Sheet to the Signing Date, neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has done
any of the following:

(A) (i) issued or otherwise allowed to become outstanding or acquired or
pledged or otherwise encumbered any equity interest or other security of Buyer
or any security convertible or exchangeable into any equity interest or other
security of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, or any right (including any
option, warrant, put, call, subscription, stock appreciation or commitment) of
any kind with respect to any such equity interest or other security (other
than as may arise by the terms of this Agreement), (ii) split, combined,
recapitalized or reclassified any of its equity interests or issued or
authorized the issuance of any other security in respect of, in lieu of or in
substitution for any of its equity interests or other securities or made any
other change to its capital structure, (iii) purchased, redeemed or otherwise
acquired any equity interest or any other security of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries or any right, warrant or option to acquire any such equity
interest or other security or (iv) other than dividends payable solely in
cash, declared, set aside, paid or made any dividend or other distribution
payable in stock or property;

(B) except for sales of inventory in its Ordinary Course of Business, made any
sale, lease to any other Person, license to any other Person or other
disposition of any material asset, whether tangible or intangible, (ii) failed
to preserve and maintain all of the real property in substantially the same
condition as existed on the date of the Buyer Balance Sheet Date, ordinary
wear and tear excepted, (iii) acquired by merging with, or by purchasing a
substantial portion of the stock or assets of, or by any other manner, any
business or any Person or division thereof, or (iv) adopted a plan of
liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange,
restructuring, recapitalization or reorganization;

(C) granted or had come into existence any material Encumbrance on any asset,
other than in its Ordinary Course of Business;

(D) incurred any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness to
any of Buyer's Subsidiaries; and, for the avoidance of doubt, the need to have
or put in place, or collateralize, any letter of credit is not itself
considered Indebtedness for borrowed money under this clause) that will not be
satisfied at or before Closing or made any loan, advance or capital
contribution to any other Person (other than any of Buyer's Subsidiaries);

(E) failed to prepare and timely file all Tax Returns with respect to Buyer or
any of its Subsidiaries required to be filed during such period or timely
withhold and remit any employment Taxes with respect to Buyer or such
Subsidiary (taking into account any proper extension); 

(F) (i) adopted or changed any material accounting method or principle used by
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, except as required under GAAP or the Code or
(ii) changed any annual accounting period;

(G) amended or changed, or authorized any amendment or change to, any of its
Organizational Documents; or

(H) committed or agreed to do any of the foregoing.

4.5 Litigation, Orders and Injunctions. There is no material Proceeding
pending or, to Buyer's or Merger Sub's Knowledge, Threatened against Buyer or
any of its Subsidiaries or their assets, and none of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or subject to any material restriction or limitation
on any of its operations under any order or injunction of any Governmental
Authority, except, in each case, as would not have a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect.

4.6 Financing. Buyer has cash available and existing debt commitment letters
(together with any replacement or amendment as contemplated below and any
comparable document with respect to any Alternative Financing, the "Debt
Commitment Letter") which are sufficient to enable it to pay $850 million of
the cash portion of the Merger Consideration. Attached to Schedule 4.6 is an
accurate and complete copy of the Debt Commitment Letter and the related fee
letter (redacted in a customary manner). The Debt Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect, enforceable in accordance with its terms, duly authorized by
the parties thereto and has not been amended, modified or supplemented in any
manner (provided, that Buyer may replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter
to add Financing Sources which have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as
of the date hereof, or otherwise replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter
so long as any replacement or additional Financing Sources with respect
thereto are not Affiliates of Buyer and are generally engaged in providing
financing of the type contemplated, and any such replacement or amendment
would not (x) expand the conditions precedent to the financing as set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, (y) be reasonably expected
to delay the Closing or (z) reduce the aggregate amount available under the
Debt Commitment Letter below an amount that, when combined with Buyer's other
sources of funds, is sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration and satisfy
all of its other payment obligations hereunder as required by and in
accordance with this Agreement). Buyer has fully paid (or caused to be paid)
any and all commitment fees or other fees under the Debt Commitment Letter
that are due and payable on or prior to the date hereof, and will fully pay
(or cause to be paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees under the Debt
Commitment Letter that are due and payable after the date hereof and prior to
Closing. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer, nor to the
Knowledge of Buyer, any other party thereto, under the Debt Commitment Letter,
and Buyer does not believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis
any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it under the Debt
Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing Date. There are no conditions
precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter other than those conditions
precedent as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. There are no
side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements that affect or
limit the funding of the full amount of the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer
understands and acknowledges that under the terms of this Agreement, Buyer's
obligation to consummate the acquisition is not in any way contingent upon or
otherwise subject to Buyer's consummation of any financing arrangements
(including the amendment or other modification of Buyer's existing credit
agreement or any other existing financing arrangement), or Buyer's obtaining
any financing or the availability, grant, provision or extension of any
financing to Buyer.

4.7 Buyer's Independent Investigation. Buyer and Merger Sub each represents,
warrants and acknowledges that (i) it and its representatives have undertaken
an independent investigation, examination, analysis and verification of each
Acquired Company and the Business and the assets, liabilities, operations,
financial results and prospects of each Acquired Company, including Buyer's
and Merger Sub's own estimate of the value of the Shares (ii) it has had the
opportunity to ask questions of, and has received sufficient answers from, the
Acquired Companies, the Sellers and their respective representatives, with
respect to the Business and the assets, liabilities, operations, financial
results, and prospects of each Acquired Company, (iii) all materials and
information requested by Buyer or Merger Sub have been provided to Buyer and
Merger Sub to their reasonable satisfaction, and (iv) it has undertaken 

such due diligence (including a review of the assets, liabilities, books,
records and contracts of each Acquired Company) as each of them deems
adequate. Neither Buyer nor Merger Sub has relied upon, and each expressly
waives and releases the Sellers (including for any payment out of the Post-
Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount) from any liability for any claims relating
to or arising from, any representation, warranty, statement, advice, document,
projection, or other information of any type provided by the Sellers, any
Acquired Company, or their Affiliates or any of their representatives, except
for those representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article 3. In
connection with such investigation, each of Buyer and Merger Sub and their
representatives have received from or on behalf of the Sellers or the Acquired
Companies certain estimates, budgets, forecasts, plans and financial
projections ("Forward‑Looking Statements"), and Buyer and Merger Sub each
acknowledges that (x) there are uncertainties inherent in making
Forward‑Looking Statements, (y) it is familiar with such uncertainties and it
is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy
and accuracy of all Forward‑Looking Statements, and (z) except for those
representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article 3, none of the
Sellers, the Acquired Companies, or any other Person is making any
representation or warranty with respect to, or will have or be subject to any
liability to Buyer, Merger Sub, or any other Person resulting from, the
distribution to Buyer or Merger Sub, or their use of, Forward‑Looking
Statements.

4.8 No Business Activities by Merger Sub. Other than this Agreement and any
other Contract entered into in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, Merger Sub is not a party to any Contract and has not conducted any
activity other than in connection with the organization of Merger Sub, the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Merger Sub does not hold or own or have the
right to acquire any equity interest in any other entity.

4.9 Brokers. Buyer has no obligation to any broker, finder or similar
intermediary regarding the sale and purchase of the Shares hereunder that
would cause any Seller to become obligated for payment of any fee or expense
with respect to such transactions.

ARTICLE 5 - CERTAIN COVENANTS

5.1 Certain Actions to Close Transactions. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, each Party (other than the Sellers' Representative) will use its
reasonable best efforts (except, where this Agreement specifically identifies
a different efforts standard, such other standard shall apply) to promptly
fulfill, and to cause to be promptly satisfied, the conditions in Article 7
(but with no obligation to waive any such condition) and to consummate and
effect the transactions contemplated herein, including to cooperate with and
assist each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the foregoing.
In no event will "reasonable best efforts" be deemed to require the payment of
any cash or other consideration or any other material concession by Buyer,
Merger Sub or any Acquired Company. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the following will apply:

(a) HSR Act. With respect to the transactions contemplated herein, each
applicable Party will (or will cause its applicable Affiliate to), within
seven Business Days after the Signing Date (or sooner, to the extent required
by Applicable Law), file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the
"FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") the required
notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act and related requirements.
Thereafter, each applicable Party will (or will cause its applicable Affiliate
to) submit and otherwise provide any supplemental or additional information
reasonably requested in connection therewith pursuant to such Applicable Laws,
including any reasonable request for additional information or documentary
material pursuant to 16 C.F.R. § 803.20. Such actions will comply, in all
material respects, with such Applicable Laws. Buyer will pay when due all
filing and submission fees under the HSR Act. Each applicable Party will
furnish, or cause to be furnished, to the other any necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with
its preparation of any filing or submission necessary under such Applicable
Laws. Each applicable Party will keep the other Parties reasonably informed,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, of the status of any
communications with, and inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Authority, and, except as
provided below in this Section 5.1(a), will use its reasonable best efforts
(and, if applicable, cause its appropriate Affiliate to) and act in good faith
and reasonably cooperate with the other Party in connection with any Antitrust
Filings and in connection with resolving any investigation, request for
information or other inquiry of any such agency or other Governmental
Authority under the HSR Act with respect to such filing, this Agreement or the 

transactions contemplated hereby. Each applicable Party will (and, if
applicable, will cause its appropriate Affiliate to) act in good faith to
request and pursue early termination of the waiting period required under the
HSR Act. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
including Section 5.1, none of Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries
shall be required to, and the Company shall not (and shall not permit any of
the Company Subsidiaries to), without the prior written consent of Buyer,
become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any
action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding,
agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business
of any of the Acquired Companies, the Surviving Corporation, Buyer, Merger Sub
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) conduct, restrict, operate,
invest or otherwise change the assets, business or portion of business of any
of the Acquired Companies, the Surviving Corporation, Buyer, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Subsidiaries in any manner, (iii) impose any restriction,
requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the
business of any of the Acquired Companies, the Surviving Corporation, Buyer,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided that, if
requested by Buyer, the Company shall (and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to) become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or
otherwise take any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long as such requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only binding on
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the event the Closing
occurs, or (iv) materially modify or waive any of the terms or conditions of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, including Section 5.1, none of Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates shall be required to file, take, defend, contest or resist any
action or proceeding, whether judicial or administrative (or to take any
action to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any order, writ,
assessment, decision, injunction, decree, ruling or judgment) of or against a
Governmental Authority, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Sellers' Representative is not an "applicable Party"
for the purposes of this Section 5.1(a).

(b) Letters of Credit. With respect to letters of credit outstanding as of the
Closing Date, to which any Acquired Company is a party or bound (each of such
letters of credit outstanding as of the Signing Date are described in Schedule
5.1(b) and the Company shall update Schedule 5.1(b) as of the Closing Date),
the Parties acknowledge that to prepare for or complete Closing, Buyer may be
required to, or it may be desirable to, arrange for an Acquired Company to
replace, collateralize (with cash or one or more letters of credit) or make
similar arrangements regarding such letters of credit (including that such
letters of credit may need to remain in place on a temporary basis to
facilitate the transition to post-Closing financing for the Acquired
Companies). Buyer and the Company promptly will take such actions if so
required or desirable.

(c) Efforts to Obtain Consents. The Company and Buyer each will use reasonable
best efforts to promptly give any required notices to, and promptly make any
required filings with, other Persons with respect to each Consent at or before
Closing, and each will cooperate with the other in all reasonable respects in
connection therewith.

5.2 Pre-Closing Conduct of Business.

(a) Certain Required Actions. Except as expressly contemplated herein
(including in Section 5.2(b)) or as otherwise consented to in writing by Buyer
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), from the
execution and delivery of this Agreement through Closing, the Company will,
and will cause each other Acquired Company to, conduct its business in its
Ordinary Course of Business, and use its reasonable best efforts to: (1)
preserve the present business operations, organization and goodwill of the
Acquired Companies, (2) preserve the present relationships with customers,
suppliers, licensors and licensees of the Acquired Companies, (3) maintain in
full force and effect the Insurance Policies, and (4) complete the actions set
forth on Schedule 5.2(a)(4). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
except as consented to in writing by Buyer (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Company will not, and will not permit
any Company Subsidiary to, do any of the following:

(1) (A) issue or otherwise allow to become outstanding or acquire or pledge or
otherwise encumber any equity interest or other security of an Acquired
Company or any security convertible or exchangeable into any equity interest
or other security of an Acquired Company, or any right (including any 

option, warrant, put, call, subscription, stock appreciation or commitment) of
any kind with respect to any such equity interest or other security, (B)
split, combine, recapitalize or reclassify any of its equity interests or
issue or authorize the issuance of any other security in respect of, in lieu
of or in substitution for any of its equity interests or other securities or
make any other change to its capital structure, (C) purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any equity interest or any other security of such Acquired
Company or of any other Acquired Company or any right, warrant or option to
acquire any such equity interest or other security, in each case except to the
extent the foregoing is a part of the Optionee exercising an Option before
Closing or the taking of any action expressly contemplated herein with respect
to any Option or any PSR; or (D) other than dividends in the Ordinary Course
of Business payable solely in cash to cover the tax obligations of the Sellers
or as set forth on Schedule 5.2(a)(1), declare, set aside, pay or make any
dividend or other distribution, payable in cash, stock or property;

(2) (A) except for sales of inventory in its Ordinary Course of Business, make
any sale, lease to any other Person, license to any other Person or other
disposition of any material asset, whether tangible or intangible, (B) fail to
preserve and maintain all of the Real Property in substantially the same
condition as existed on the Signing Date, ordinary wear and tear excepted, (C)
demolish or erect any structure on any of the Real Property, (D) make any
capital expenditure or purchase or otherwise acquire any material asset (other
than purchases of inventory in its Ordinary Course of Business and other than
capital expenditures set forth on the capital expenditures budget provided to
Buyer prior to the Signing Date or as set forth on Schedule 5.2(a)(2)), enter
into a new letter of intent, use, license agreement or lease for any real
property from any other Person or enter into a lease for any tangible personal
property from any other Person, except leases of tangible personal property in
its Ordinary Course of Business, (E) acquire by merging with, or by purchasing

business or any Person or division thereof, or (F) adopt a plan of
liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange,

(3) grant or have come into existence any material Encumbrance on any asset,
other than (A) any Permitted Encumbrance or (B) in its Ordinary Course of
Business;

(4) (A) become a guarantor with respect to, assume or otherwise become

obligations entered into or provided to customers in its Ordinary Course of
Business, or (B) agree to maintain the financial condition of any other
Person, other than any other Acquired Company;

(5) incur any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness (A) to
any other Acquired Company or (B) incurred under the Company's credit
agreement in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Acquired Companies; and,
for the avoidance of doubt, (i) the need to have or put in place, or
collateralize, any letter of credit is not itself considered Indebtedness for
borrowed money under this clause, but shall be deemed Funded Indebtedness to
the extent such letter of credit is drawn upon as of the Closing, and (ii) in
no event shall any Acquired Company borrow under any incremental, accordion or
similar facility under the Company's credit agreement) that will not be
satisfied at or before Closing or make any loan, advance or capital
contribution to any other Person (other than any (X) loan, advance or capital
contribution to another Acquired Company or (Y) loan or advance to an employee
of an Acquired Company, in each case in the Ordinary Course of Business of
such Acquired Company);

(6) except in its Ordinary Course of Business, enter into any material
Contract (including any Contract which would have been a Major Contract if in
effect as of the Signing Date), or amend or terminate in any respect that is
material and adverse to any Acquired Company any material Contract to which
such Acquired Company is a party (including any Major Contract), in each case
that is not terminable at will or upon not more than 90 days' notice by any
Acquired Company without any additional obligation (including payment

excess of $250,000 or which would involve a non-monetary remedy that is

(b) Certain Permitted Actions. Notwithstanding Section 5.2(a), (i) nothing in
this Section 5.2 requires that any Acquired Company make any capital
expenditure and (ii) this Agreement will not prevent or otherwise restrict any
Acquired Company from doing any of the following:

(1) facilitate the removal from the Real Property by one or more Sellers the
items listed on Schedule 5.2(b)(1);

(2) take or refrain from any action, to the extent expressly required by the
terms of this Agreement; or

(3) take any action described on Schedule 5.2(b)(3).

5.3 Pre-Closing Conduct of Buyer. Except as expressly contemplated herein or
as otherwise consented to in writing by the Company (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), from the execution and delivery of this
Agreement through Closing, Buyer will, and will cause each its Affiliates to,
conduct its business in its Ordinary Course of Business, except that neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will take any of the actions set forth on
Schedule 5.3 or do any of the following: 

(a) acquire or enter into any agreement to acquire (by merger, consolidation,
acquisition of equity interests or assets, joint venture or otherwise) any
business or any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture or other business organization or division thereof or otherwise enter
into any agreement, if such acquisition or the entering into such agreement
could reasonably be expected to (1) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or
increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization or order from any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period, (2) increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on
appeal or otherwise or (3) otherwise delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

(b) any action that would reasonably be expected to materially interfere with
Buyer's ability to make available as of the Merger Effective Time funds
sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Buyer's and Merger Sub's obligations
under this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration and
the payment of all associated costs and expenses.

5.4 Further Assurances. If after Closing any further action is necessary,
proper or desirable to carry out any purpose of this Agreement, then each
Party will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of
further documents) as another Party reasonably requests to carry out such
purpose. The foregoing will be at the expense of such requesting Party, except
to the extent this Agreement otherwise allocates such expense to any other
Person.

5.5 Access to Information.

(a) Pre-Closing Access for Buyer. From the Signing Date through Closing,
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company's reasonable
confidentiality precautions, including those based on the confidential nature
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein, the Company will
permit (and will cause the Company Subsidiaries to permit) Buyer and Buyer's
representatives to have reasonable access during normal business hours and
upon reasonable notice from Buyer, to the facilities, books and records of
each Acquired Company for the opportunity to prepare for Closing and identify
actions that will be necessary or desirable to transition ownership of the
Acquired Companies to Buyer, including ordering title insurance commitments or
reports, Phase I environmental site assessments and surveys. Buyer and Buyer's
representatives will conduct such investigation in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the operations of any Acquired Company.

(b) Post-Closing Access for Sellers. Throughout the seven-year period after
Closing, subject to each Seller's written agreement to Buyer's reasonable
confidentiality precautions, which written agreement shall be a condition to
the grant of any access under this Section 5.5(b), Buyer will, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice from such Seller: (1) cause such
Seller and such Seller's representatives (including Sellers' Representative)
to have reasonable access to the books and records (including financial and
Tax records, Tax Returns, files, papers and related items) of each Acquired
Company and its applicable Affiliates with respect to periods ending on or
before the end of the Straddle Period, in each case to the extent necessary or
reasonably desirable to (A) defend or pursue any Proceeding, (B) prepare or
audit financial statements, (C) prepare or file Tax Returns or (D) address
other Tax, accounting, financial or legal matters or respond to any
investigation or other inquiry by or under the control of any Governmental
Authority; and (2) permit any Seller and such Seller's representatives to make
copies of such books and records for the foregoing purposes, at such Seller's
expense.

5.6 Confidentiality and Publicity.

(a) Confidentiality Agreement. Subject to the other terms of this Section 5.6,
the Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 29, 2014, between Buyer and the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), will remain in full force and
effect pursuant to its terms until the conclusion of Closing, at which time
the Confidentiality Agreement automatically will be terminated.

(b) Publicity. Except as stated in this Section 5.6(b), from the date hereof
through the Closing Date, each Party will not, and each Party will cause each
of its Affiliates not to (and the Company shall not permit any Seller to),
make any public release or announcement regarding this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated herein without the prior written approval thereof of
each Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, 

conditioned or delayed), unless, in the judgment of the Company or Buyer, as
applicable, public disclosure is otherwise required by Applicable Law or by
the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Buyer lists securities,
provided that, to the extent required by Applicable Law or the applicable
rules of any such exchange, the Party intending to make such disclosure shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with Applicable Law to
consult with the other Party with respect to the text thereof. Each Party
(other than the Sellers' Representative) will cooperate with each other (to
the extent requested) in issuing, promptly after the execution of this
Agreement and promptly after the Closing, joint press releases with mutually
agreed upon text that announces the transactions contemplated herein generally
(but which will not disclose the identity of any Shareholder). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, (1) each Party (and each employee,
representative, and other agent of such Party) may disclose to any and all
Persons, without limitation of any kind, the Tax treatment and Tax structure
(as such terms are used in Code Section 6011) of the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided that such disclosure may not be made prior to public
announcement of the execution of this Agreement (provided this authorization
is not intended to permit disclosure of any information to the extent not
related to the transaction's Tax treatment or Tax structure), and (2) the
Company or Buyer may respond to questions from analysts or news reporters to
the extent that such responses are consistent with public releases or
announcements previously disclosed in accordance with this Section 5.6(b).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following Closing
and the public announcement (if any) of the Merger, the Sellers'
Representative shall be permitted to publicly announce that it has been
engaged to serve as the Sellers' Representative in connection with the Merger
as long as such announcement does not disclose any of the other terms of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated herein.

5.7 Employee Matters.

(a) Compensation. Until June 30, 2017 (the "Continuation Period"), Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates to, provide to each individual who, immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time is an employee of an Acquired Company, including any individual
on short-term or long-term disability leave immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time (i) at least the same salary or hourly wage rate provided to
such employee immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, (ii) at least
the same short-term (annual or more frequent) bonus or commission opportunity
provided to such employee immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and
(iii) other compensation and benefits (excluding equity and equity-based
awards and wellness programs and incentives, which will remain discretionary)
that are no less favorable in the aggregate as those provided to such employee
under the compensation and benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements and
arrangements of the Acquired Companies in effect immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time (subsections (a)(i), (a)(ii), and (a)(iii) being
collectively referred to as "Comparable Benefits"). For avoidance of doubt, in
no event shall wellness programs or incentives, whether provided in connection
with or outside of a group health plan, be considered a Comparable Benefit
that must be maintained during the Continuation Period. Notwithstanding
Section 5.7(b), Buyer shall maintain full discretion as to whether to provide
such Comparable Benefits under Company Plans or plans or arrangements of Buyer
or its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
after the Merger Effective Time, nothing herein shall preclude the Surviving
Corporation from terminating the employment of any employee for any lawful
reason; provided that Comparable Benefits shall not be provided following
termination of employment except to the extent required by COBRA or by
Schedule 5.7(a). Except as provided in Schedule 5.7(a), all severance and
change in control benefits to be provided for eligible employees terminated
after the Merger Effective Time but during the Continuation Period shall be as
provided according to Schedule 5.7(a), subject to the terms of any applicable
Buyer Plan effective immediately after the Merger Effective Time or, if more
favorable with respect to severance only (but not change in control), the
terms of the employee's employment agreement.

(b) Company Plans. Prior to the Closing, the applicable Acquired Company shall
adopt resolutions to terminate the MOM Brands Profit-Sharing and Savings Plan,
and any other Company Plan that Buyer so designates in writing to the Company
within a reasonable period of time prior to the Closing Date, effective on or
prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing, the applicable Acquired
Company shall terminate the Company Long Term Incentive Plan, restated
effective November 15, 2011, and all aggregated arrangements, including but
not limited to the Malt-O-Meal Company Deferred Performance Appreciation
Rights Plan, and (i) take any and all action necessary to fully vest accounts
thereunder effective immediately prior to or upon Closing and (ii) provide for
payment of all amounts accrued under the Company Long Term Incentive Plan,
including the cash-out of PSRs as provided in Section 1.14 and the
satisfaction of outstanding obligations under the Deferred Performance
Appreciation Rights Plan, including 

but not limited to those pertaining to John Lettman, with such payments being
made shortly after Closing, with such actions done in a manner that complies
with Code Section 409A. The applicable Acquired Company shall take any and all
action necessary to ensure that non-vested restricted stock awards made to
Christopher Neugent become fully vested in accordance with their terms upon
Closing.

(c) Continuation of Benefits. For all purposes under any Plans of Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates, each Acquired Company
employee shall receive full credit for such employee's years of service with
the Acquired Companies before the Merger Effective Time (including predecessor
or acquired entities or any other entities for which any Acquired Company has
given credit for prior service), but only to the extent the Acquired Company
employee is eligible to participate under the terms of such Plan after the
Merger Effective Time, and except to the extent such credit would result in a
duplication of accrual of benefits. In addition, where applicable, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each employee of any Acquired
Company as of the Merger Effective Time shall not be subject to any waiting
periods of any Plans of Buyer to the extent such waiting time was satisfied
under a similar or comparable Company Plan in which such employee participated
immediately before the Merger Effective Time (such comparable Company Plans,
collectively, the "Old Plans"), (ii) Buyer shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions or limitations and actively-at-work requirements of each
Plan of Buyer to be waived or satisfied for each employee of any Acquired
Company and his or her covered dependents to the extent waived or satisfied
under the analogous Old Plan as of the Merger Effective Time and (iii) Buyer
shall cause all eligible expenses incurred by each employee of any Acquired
Company and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee's participation in the
corresponding Plan of Buyer begins to be taken into account under such Plan of
Buyer for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year; in each case if and to the extent
Buyer determines it will provide such benefits under Plans of Buyer rather
than Company Plans, as permitted by Section 5.7(a). Nothing herein shall
require eligibility for any particular Plan of Buyer, including any defined
benefit pension plan or retiree medical plan.

(d) Community. During the Continuation Period, Buyer will (1) cause the
headquarters for the Company's Business to remain at all times at the current
Lakeville, Minnesota headquarters, and (2) make, or cause its Affiliates to
make, charitable contributions in amounts substantially similar to those
listed in Schedule 5.7(d) at such time or times during the Continuation Period
as Buyer shall determine in its sole discretion.

(e) No Amendment of Benefits nor Third Party Beneficiary. No provision of this
Section 5.7 shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Person,
including employees or former employees (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) of an Acquired Company, or trustees, administrators,
participants, or beneficiaries of any Plan, and no provision of this Section
5.7, shall create such third-party beneficiary rights in any such Person in
respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under
any Plan. Further, nothing herein shall, or shall be deemed, to amend any
Plans.

(f) Certain Covenants, Employee Matters. Promptly following the execution of
this Agreement and prior to Closing, the applicable Acquired Company shall
engage, at its sole expense, Towers Watson, or another neutral, third-party
actuary mutually agreed upon by Buyer and the Company (the "Actuary"), to
perform a valuation to determine the actuarial present value, as of the
Closing Date, of the expense of providing group medical coverage to the
"grandfathered" retirees and their families (as set forth in Item 58 on
Schedule 3.15(a)), until such retirees' deaths and in the case of retirees'
covered spouses or dependents, the deaths of such retirees' covered spouses or
dependents, as applicable. The assumptions upon which such actuarial valuation
are to be based shall be set forth in writing and presented to Buyer prior to
the commencement of such actuarial valuation and shall be subject to the prior
written approval of Buyer, and such approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The applicable Acquired Company shall present the Actuary's
valuation to Buyer prior to Closing, but in no event later than 30 days prior
to Closing, and the actuarial present value shall be a Transaction Expense
under this Agreement.

5.8 Exculpation and Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Throughout the
six‑year period after the Closing Date, Buyer will prevent the amendment,
repeal or modification of any provision in any Organizational Document of any
Acquired Company relating to exculpation or indemnification for acts or
omissions occurring on or before the Closing Date of its officers and
directors holding office before the Merger Effective Time (except to the 

extent required by Applicable Law), it being the intent of the Parties that
such officers and directors will continue to be entitled to such exculpation
and indemnification for such acts or omissions to the greatest extent
permitted under Applicable Law. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
obtain, at the expense of the Company (which shall be a Transaction Expense),
"tail" policies in respect of existing policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance maintained by the Company, for a period of six (6) years
after the Closing Date, to provide insurance coverage for events, acts or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Merger Effective Time for all Persons
who were officers or directors of any Acquired Company on or prior to the
Merger Effective Time. Buyer's obligations under this Section 5.8 will not be
terminated or modified in a manner that adversely affects any Person to whom
this Section 5.8 relates with respect to acts or omissions occurring on or
before the Closing Date without the consent of such affected Person (it being
expressly agreed that each such Person to whom this Section 5.8 relates will
be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.8).

5.9 Certain Tax Matters.

(a) Pre-Closing Tax Period Taxes. Buyer will cause to be prepared, and Buyer
will cause the Surviving Corporation to file, all Tax Returns for each
Acquired Company for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and
which are due after the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date the Company
shall engage Deloitte Tax LLP ("Deloitte") to prepare such returns. The cost
of the preparation of the Income Tax Tax Returns will be a Transaction
Expense. All Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this Section 5.9(a) will be
prepared in accordance with past practices of the Acquired Companies to the
extent consistent with Applicable Law (except that the Transaction Deductions
will be utilized to the maximum extent possible under Applicable Law). Buyer
will deliver such completed, but unfiled, Tax Returns to the Sellers'
Representative for its review comment, and approval at least 30 days prior to
the date targeted by the Company to file such Tax Returns, which date will be
no later than the due date for such Tax Returns (taking into account any
extensions obtained by the Company or an Acquired Company). Buyer and Sellers'
Representative shall consult with each other and cooperate in good faith to
resolve any timely-raised issues raised by the Sellers' Representative as a
result of the review of such Tax Returns to permit the filing of such Tax
Returns as promptly as possible. In the event that Buyer and the Seller's
Representative are unable to agree on any timely-raised issues raised by Buyer
as a result of the review of such Tax Returns, such issues will be finally
resolved in writing by the Arbitrator pursuant to Section 2.4(c).

(b) Preparation of Tax Returns. With respect to the preparation of Tax
Returns, Buyer, the Company and Sellers' Representative agree that (1) all
Transaction Deductions will be treated as properly allocable to the taxable
period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date and will be
included as deductions on the Tax Returns of the relevant Acquired Company for
such period to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, (2) Sellers'
Representative, in consultation with Buyer, will determine the amount of
Transaction Deductions and (3) the Acquired Companies' past practices will be
considered not to preclude the deduction of the Transaction Deductions to the
maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law. "Transaction Deductions" means all
items of loss, deduction or credit resulting from or attributable to (A)
payments in respect of Options and PSRs as contemplated by this Agreement, (B)
the repayment of Indebtedness at Closing or as contemplated by this Agreement,
(C) any payment in the nature of compensation for U.S. federal Income Tax
purposes to employees of any Acquired Company upon consummation of or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (D) payment of legal,
financial advisory, accounting and other fees and expenses of any Acquired
Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Transaction Expenses, except to the extent that Sellers' Representative and
Buyer determine that such fees and expenses are not properly deductible. The
Transaction Deductions will be computed consistent with the safe harbor for
treating success-based fees pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2011‑29, 2011‑18
I.R.B. 746 in lieu of maintaining the documentation required by Treasury
Regulations section 1.263(a)‑5(f).

(c) Cooperation. Each Party will, and each Party will cause its applicable
Affiliates to, cooperate in all reasonable respects with respect to Tax
matters and provide one another with such information as is reasonably
requested to enable the requesting Party to complete and file all Tax Returns
it may be required to file (or cause to be filed) with respect to any Acquired
Company, to respond to Tax audits, inquiries or other Tax Proceedings and to
otherwise satisfy Tax requirements. Such cooperation also will include
promptly forwarding copies (to the extent related thereto) of (1) relevant Tax
notices, forms or other communications received from or sent to any
Governmental Authority (whether or not requested) and (2) reasonably requested
copies of all relevant Tax Returns together with 

accompanying schedules and related workpapers, documents relating to rulings,
audits or other Tax determinations by any Governmental Authority and records
concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property.

(d) Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding the other terms of this Section 5.9, Buyer
will pay all Transfer Taxes, provided that (A) any Transfer Taxes imposed with
respect to the Pre-Closing Reorganization will be treated as Pre-Closing Taxes
hereunder, and (B) 1/2 of all Transfer Taxes with respect to the Merger will
be treated as Pre-Closing Taxes hereunder. The Parties will cooperate in
timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required to
comply with the provisions of Applicable Law relating to such Transfer Taxes.

(e) Amending Tax Returns. Buyer will not, and Buyer will cause its Affiliates
(including any Acquired Company) not to, (1) amend any Tax Return of any
Acquired Company relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (2) compromise or
settle any Tax liability with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each
case without Sellers' Representative's written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(f) 338(h)(10) Election. All of the Shareholders and Buyer will, and if
applicable each will cause its relevant Affiliates to, jointly make a timely
and irrevocable election under section 338(h)(10) of the Code and, if
permissible (including after Closing), similar elections under any applicable
state, local or non-U.S. Income Tax laws with respect to the acquisition
hereunder of the Company (the "338(h)(10) Election"). The Company shall not,
and shall not permit the Shareholders or any other Person to, before Closing,
(1) revoke the Company's election to be taxed as an S corporation within the
meaning of sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code or (2) take or permit or fail to
prevent any action that would result in the termination of the Company's
status as a validly existing S corporation within the meaning of sections 1361
and 1362 of the Code. Each of the Shareholders has delivered a duly executed
338(h)(10) Election Form to the Company and the Company shall deliver all such
duly executed 338(h)(10) Election Forms to Buyer as provided in Section 5.18.
Buyer will deliver at Closing a duly executed IRS Form 8023 that reflects the
338(h)(10) Election. Between the Signing Date and the Closing Date, the
Company shall not permit any Shareholder to transfer his, her or its Shares to
any other Person unless such transfer is approved in advance by Buyer in
writing and unless the approved transferee delivers to Buyer a 338(h)(10)
Election Form at the time of any such approved transfer. Throughout the
one‑year period following the Closing Date, Buyer will not take or permit or
fail to prevent any action involving Buyer or any Acquired Company, by way of
merger, liquidation, sale of assets or other transaction, that has the effect
of invalidating the 338(h)(10) Election.

(g) Composite Tax Returns. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Buyer,
on behalf of the Company, agrees to file composite Income Tax Tax Returns
covering all eligible Sellers in all states where the Company will file an
Income Tax Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (the "Composite Tax
Returns"). Composite Tax Returns for periods ending on or before the Closing
Date shall be prepared by Deloitte in accordance with the procedures in
Section 5.9(a) and the costs and expenses of such preparation shall be a
Transaction Expense; any other Composite Tax Return which includes any of the
Sellers shall be prepared by Buyer. Sellers have been advised that the Company
will be required to pay the Income Tax as shown due for each Seller
participating in any Composite Tax Return. Buyer shall not be required to
allow any Seller to participate in any Composite Tax Return unless such Seller
has paid or causes to be paid to the applicable Acquired Company, at or prior
to the time for filing such Composite Tax Return, an amount equal to such
Seller's share of the Income Tax liability reflected on such Composite Tax
Return and provides all required consents and other documentation required for
the Company to file a Composite Tax Return on behalf of such Seller in any
state or other jurisdiction.

5.10 Exclusivity. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company
shall not, and it shall not permit any Company Subsidiary or any of its or
their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives or agents to,
directly or indirectly (a) discuss, negotiate, undertake, authorize,
recommend, propose or enter into any transaction involving a merger,
consolidation, business combination, purchase or disposition of any material
assets of any Acquired Company (other than in its Ordinary Course of Business)
or any capital stock or other equity interests of any Acquired Company (an
"Acquisition Transaction"), (b) facilitate, encourage, solicit or initiate
discussions, negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of
an Acquisition Transaction, (c) furnish or cause to be furnished, to any
Person, any information concerning the business, operations, properties or
assets of any Acquired Company in connection with an Acquisition Transaction,
or (d) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or
seek any of the foregoing. The Company 

shall, and it shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons (other than Buyer and Merger Sub) conducted heretofore with respect to
any of the foregoing.

5.11 Notice of Events. The Company shall keep Buyer reasonably informed, on a
current basis, of any events, discussions, notices or changes with respect to
any Tax, criminal or regulatory investigation or action involving any Acquired
Company, other than in each case ordinary course events, discussions, notices
and changes which are not material to any of the Acquired Companies, and shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer and its Affiliates in an effort to avoid or
mitigate any cost or regulatory consequences to the Acquired Companies that
might arise from such investigation or action (including by reviewing written
submissions in advance and coordinating and providing assistance in meetings
with regulators). Buyer shall notify the Company and the Sellers'
Representative in writing promptly upon Buyer's or Merger Sub's discovery of
any information on or prior to the Merger Effective Time which causes (or
would be reasonably likely to cause) the failure of the conditions set forth
in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) to be satisfied. The Company shall notify Buyer
in writing promptly upon any Acquired Company's discovery of any information
on or prior to the Merger Effective Time which causes (or would be reasonably
likely to cause) the failure of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(a),
7.1(b) or 7.1(c) to be satisfied. This Section 5.11 shall not constitute a
covenant or agreement for purposes of Sections 7.1(b) or 7.2(b).

5.12 Financial Information.

(a) Within 20 days after the end of each fiscal month, the Company shall
deliver to Buyer and Merger Sub an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Acquired Companies as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal month
and unaudited consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income of
the Acquired Companies for the most recently completed fiscal month and for
the period from the first day of such fiscal year to the end of the most
recently completed fiscal month in such fiscal year.

(b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be
delivered to Buyer:

(1) no later than February 28, 2015, audited consolidated financial statements
of the Company consisting of a consolidated, audited balance sheet as of
December 27, 2014 and consolidated, audited statements of income,
comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for the fiscal year
ended December 27, 2014 (collectively, the "2014 Annual Financial
Statements"); and

(2) thereafter, within 40 days after the end of each fiscal quarter of the
Company commencing with the fiscal quarter ended March 28, 2015, the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the last day of such fiscal
quarter and related statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders'
equity and cash flows of the Company on a consolidated basis (including the
accompanying notes to the foregoing financial statements) as of and for the
period between December 27, 2014 and the last day of such fiscal quarter and
for the corresponding period of the fiscal year ended December 27, 2014.

(c) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
accounting firm responsible for auditing the 2014 Annual Financial Statements
to deliver the 2014 Annual Financial Statements within the time period
described in clause (b)(1) of this Section 5.12 and shall provide such
assistance as is reasonably necessary for the accounting firm responsible for
auditing the 2014 Annual Financial Statements and reviewing the interim period
financial statements described in clause (b)(2) of this Section 5.12 to
perform any such audits or review as provided for in this Section 5.12 within
the time periods specified herein, including the execution and delivery of
reasonable and customary representation letters to any such accounting firm
(if and to the extent required by any such accounting firm). The Company shall
keep Buyer informed as to the status of the 2014 Annual Financial Statements
and the interim period financial statements described in clause (b)(2) of this
Section 5.12 and the expected timing for the delivery thereof, and the Company
also shall cooperate with Buyer and provide such information, or reasonable
access thereto, with respect to the Company as may be reasonably requested by
Buyer to permit Buyer to prepare pro forma financial information in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, including any financing thereof. 

(d) The interim period financial statements described in clause (b)(2) of this
Section 5.12 shall be reviewed in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America by the Company's independent auditors
or another accounting firm of national standing reasonably acceptable to
Buyer. The 2014 Annual Financial Statements and the interim period financial
statements described in clause (b)(2) of this Section 5.12 shall be in a form
that will enable the independent auditors of the Company to render a customary
"comfort letter" (including customary "negative assurances"). The interim
period financial statements described in clause (b)(2) of this Section 5.12
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the financial statements and
related notes contained in the 2014 Annual Financial Statements, but need not
include year-end adjustments.

5.13 Financing.

(a) Each of Buyer and Merger Sub shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing at Closing on the terms and
conditions, when taken as a whole (including the "flex" provisions), described
in the Debt Commitment Letter and to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, or in Buyer's
good faith judgment proper or advisable in connection therewith, including
using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt
Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions
thereof until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated
or this Agreement is terminated, (ii) satisfy all conditions and covenants
applicable to Buyer and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letter and otherwise
comply with their respective obligations thereunder, (iii) enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
consistent in all material respects with the terms and conditions of the Debt
Commitment Letter, and (iv) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to
Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer and Merger
Sub shall give the Company prompt notice: (A) of any material breach or
default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach
or default) by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive document
related to the Debt Financing of which Buyer or Merger Sub becomes aware; (B)
of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
party to the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to any actual or potential
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing;
and (C) if for any reason Buyer or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it
is reasonably likely that they will fail to obtain all or any portion of the
Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive documents related to the Debt
Financing. Unless this Agreement has terminated, Buyer and Merger Sub shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Company, enter into any
amendment or modification to, replacement of, or grant any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, or exercise its right to terminate any commitment
under, the Debt Commitment Letter, if such amendment, modification,
replacement, waiver or termination would or would reasonably be expected to
impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any
of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (x) adversely affect the ability or likelihood of
Buyer or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (y) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing less likely to
occur. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within three (3)
Business Days after the date the Company delivers to Buyer or Merger Sub a
written request, Buyer and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably
requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause
(A), (B) or (C) above. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources (the "Alternative Financing") on terms not materially less
favorable when taken as a whole, together with other sources of funds
available to Buyer, sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event. In the event that Alternative Financing is arranged in accordance with
this Section 5.14(a), the term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall mean the
commitment letter and term sheet for such Alternative Financing (as amended,
replaced, supplemented or modified in accordance with this Section 5.14(a)).
In the event that Alternative Financing shall be obtained pursuant to this
Section 5.14(a), the Parties (other than the Sellers' Representative) shall
comply with the covenants in this Section 5.14(a) with respect to such
Alternative Financing mutatis mutandis. Buyer shall furnish correct and
complete copies of all definitive agreements relating to the Alternative
Financing to the Company promptly upon their execution (redacted in a
customary manner). Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep
the Company informed on a 

reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of all material activity
concerning the status of its efforts to obtain Alternative Financing and to
consummate Debt Financing, including any Alternative Financing. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require or cause
Buyer or Merger Sub to bring any action, suit or claim against any Financing
Source.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary to, use its and their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
their respective accountants, consultants, legal counsel, officers and
employees to use their commercially reasonable efforts to, provide to Buyer
and Merger Sub (at Buyer's sole expense, unless otherwise deemed to be a
Transaction Expense hereunder) all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer
in connection with the arrangement of the financing set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter (together with the offering or private placement of debt
securities contemplated thereby and the engagement letters referred to therein
(the "Debt Financing")), including any equity financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter, including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cause, upon reasonable advance notice by Buyer and on a reasonable number of
occasions, appropriate officers and employees of the Acquired Companies to
participate in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies and to assist with the
preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents,
roadshow presentations, private placement memoranda, offering memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Debt Financing or any equity financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter and otherwise assist in the marketing efforts related
to the Debt Financing or any equity financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, (ii) provide its accountants with appropriate
representations in connection with the preparation of, and furnish Buyer and
Merger Sub and their Financing Sources as promptly as practical with,
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Acquired Companies as
may be reasonably requested by Buyer and that is customary to be included
about a company to be acquired by an issuer in an offering document relating
to an underwritten offering of high-yield debt securities under Rule 144A of
the Securities Act (including the Required Financial Information) but
excluding the information required by Rules 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X
and compensation discussion and analysis, (iii) before the Closing Date,
provide appropriate representations in connection with the preparation of
financial statements and other financial data of the Acquired Companies and
obtain accountants' consents in connection with the use of the Acquired
Companies' financial statements in offering documents, prospectuses and
similar documents which are filed with the SEC; (iv) obtain customary
accountants' comfort letters on the Required Financial Information (including
"negative assurance" comfort on any pro forma or other financial data
referenced above), legal opinions, surveys and title insurance as reasonably
requested by Buyer; (v) execute and deliver, effective as of the Merger
Effective Time and on the Closing Date, one or more credit or other agreements
on terms satisfactory to Buyer in connection with the Debt Financing as well
as any guaranty, pledge and security documents, currency or interest hedging
arrangements, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates or
documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer (including a certificate of
the chief financial officer of any Acquired Company with respect to solvency
matters) and otherwise reasonably facilitate the pledging of collateral and
take all necessary corporate or other entity actions to facilitate all of the
foregoing (it being understood that no Acquired Company shall be required to
execute any Contracts that would be effective prior to the Merger Effective
Time), (vi) at least five days prior to the Closing Date, provide all
documentation and other information about the Acquired Companies as is
reasonably requested in writing by Buyer with respect to applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations including the USA
PATRIOT Act; (vii) arrange for the repayment on the Closing Date of all of the
Acquired Companies' existing secured bank and unsecured notes facilities from
the proceeds of the Debt Financing contemplated hereby, including by providing
the lenders and holders of notes thereunder with such notices of the
transactions contemplated hereby and the closing thereof as may be required
under such facilities (subject to the occurrence of the Closing, to the extent
that such condition is permissible under the applicable facilities), by
obtaining customary pay-off letters, lien terminations, title transfers, and
instruments of discharge or transfer relating to any collateral to be
delivered on the Closing Date; (viii) obtain any authorization or consent from
the Acquired Companies or any of their respective representatives reasonably
necessary or required in connection with the financing; (ix) obtain any
authorization or consent from the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective representatives reasonably necessary or required in connection with
the financing, including (A) customary authorization letters to the lenders
and agents in respect of any bank financing authorizing the distribution of
information to prospective lenders and containing a representation to such
Financing Sources that the public side versions of such documents, if any, do
not include material non-public information about the Acquired Companies and
(B) consent from the Acquired Companies' independent 

auditors to the inclusion of their report or the financial statements in any
offering document or registration statement or prospectus; and (ix) assist
Buyer in obtaining any corporate credit and family ratings from any ratings
agencies contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. The Company hereby
consents to the use of the Acquired Companies logos in connection with the
Debt Financing or any equity financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter in a form and manner mutually agreed with the Company; provided,
however, that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended, or
reasonably likely, to harm or disparage any of the Acquired Companies or the
reputation or goodwill of any of the Acquired Companies. In connection with
any offering document, prospectus or similar documents prepared by Buyer and
used to market any debt or equity securities contemplated pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter prior to Closing, the Company will, upon request of Buyer,
use its reasonable efforts to periodically update any Required Financial
Information included in such offering document, prospectus or similar document
so that Buyer may ensure that such Required Financial Information, when taken
as a whole, does not contain as of the time provided, giving effect to any
supplements, any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
materially misleading. The Company shall, and it shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, keep confidential the terms and conditions of the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing and any equity financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter. The Company shall not be required, under the
provisions of this Section 5.13(b) or otherwise in connection with the Debt
Commitment Letter (x) to pay any commitment or other similar fee prior to the
Merger Effective Time or (y) to incur any expense unless such expense is
reimbursed by Buyer on the earlier of the Merger Effective Time or termination
of this Agreement in accordance herewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
obligation of the Company under any certificate, document or instrument
delivered in connection with the Debt Financing shall be effective until the
Merger Effective Time and the Company shall not be required to take any action
under any such certificate, document or instrument that is not contingent upon
the Closing.

(c) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Acquired Companies and their
respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, consultants and other authorized agents, advisors or
representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (other than to the extent such losses arise from the gross
negligence of, or willful breach of a representation or covenant herein of the
Acquired Companies by, any of the Acquired Companies). Whether or not the
Merger Effective Time occurs, Buyer shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable documented out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Company in connection with Section 5.13(b), including
reasonable legal fees, reasonable accounting fees and other reasonable fees
and expenses, but excluding expenses otherwise deemed to be Transaction
Expenses hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company shall in
good faith reasonably believe that it has delivered the Required Financial
Information, it may deliver to Buyer a written notice to that effect, in which
case the Required Financing Information shall be deemed to have been delivered
on the date such notice is received by Buyer, and the Marketing Period shall
be deemed to have commenced on the date such notice is received by Buyer, in
each case, unless Buyer in good faith reasonably believes that the Company has
not completed delivery of the Required Financial Information and, within three
(3) Business Days after the receipt of such notice from the Company, Buyer
delivers a written notice to the Company to that effect (stating with
reasonable specificity the Required Financing Information that has not been
delivered).

5.14 Certain Affiliate Agreements. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
take all action required to terminate the Share Purchase Agreements and other
Contracts between any Seller in its capacity as a shareholder and the Company
relating to such Seller's equity interests in the Company.

5.15 Pre-Closing Reorganization. No later than as of the end of the Business
Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall, in accordance
with Applicable Law (including as applicable the MBCA), merge each of MOM
Brands Enterprises, LLC, MOM Brands DISC, Inc. and MOM Brands de Mexico, S. de
R.L. de C.V. with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving
entity in such mergers (the "Pre-Closing Reorganizations"). The Company shall
keep Buyer informed on a reasonably current basis (and at any time upon
Buyer's reasonable request) in reasonable detail of the status of the Pre-
Closing Reorganizations.

5.16 Title Commitments, Title Policies and Zoning Letters. The Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in obtaining, with
respect to each parcel of Owned Real Property as desired 

by Buyer (a) ALTA or other form of title commitment for owner's, and/or
lender's policies (if applicable) of title insurance (each, a "Title
Commitment") prepared by a national title insurance company acceptable to
Buyer ("Title Company") committing to issue the Title Policies, and (b) at
Buyer's cost, current certified ALTA/ACSM or other on-the-ground, staked,
boundary survey maps of the Owned Real Property, or any portion thereof,
prepared by surveyors reasonably acceptable to Buyer and reflecting the
matters disclosed on the Title Commitment related thereto, if desired by
Buyer. The Company shall cooperate with Buyer's efforts to obtain, at Buyer's
cost, letters from the appropriate Governmental Authority in the locations
where each parcel of Real Property is located certifying zoning compliance of
such Real Property, as applicable. The Company shall deliver at the Closing an
owner's affidavit of title with respect to each parcel of Owned Real Property,
in form and substance reasonably required by Title Company, non-imputation

(extended coverage policies, including mechanic's lien coverage) on the Owned
Real Property as requested by Buyer, including such endorsements (and non-
imputation coverage) reasonably required by Buyer and obtained at Buyer's cost
(each a "Title Policy" and collectively the "Title Policies"). The Company
shall also cooperate fully with Buyer to satisfy or accomplish all
requirements of policy issuance required by Title Company and to eliminate
such exceptions from the Title Policies as Buyer may desire eliminated.

5.17 Lease Estoppels, Landlord Lien Waivers and Non-Disturbance Agreements.
The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to
Buyer at Closing (a) certificates of estoppel in a form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Buyer from each party (lessors, lessees, and
sublessees, as applicable) to each Real Property Lease desired by Buyer, (b)
if requested by Buyer, at Buyer's cost, non-disturbance agreements from each
lender of a landlord/lessor under each Real Property Lease in form and
substance acceptable to Buyer; and (c) if required by Buyer's lender, at
Buyer's cost, access and waiver of lien agreements, in form reasonably
acceptable to such lender, from the landlords/lessors under the Real Property
Leases agreeing that any trade fixtures, machinery, equipment, furniture,
inventory, goods or other personal property kept at or installed in the Leased
Real Property is personal property, is not to become a part of the realty no
matter how affixed to it, may be removed from the Leased Real Property by such
lender free and clear of any claim or lien of such landlord/lessor, and such
additional matters as may reasonably be requested by such lender to protect
its interest in such personal property (each an "Access Agreement").
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, delivery of each Access
Agreement to Buyer on or before Closing shall be deemed a deliverable under
Section 6.2). In no event will "commercially reasonable efforts" be deemed to
require the payment of any cash or other consideration or any other material
concession by any Acquired Company.

5.18 Post-Signing Deliveries. Promptly after the signing of this Agreement by
the Parties hereto (but in no event more than two Business Days thereafter),
the Company shall deliver to Buyer the Shareholders' Unanimous Written

such right) are as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parties; 

(b) by the Company or Buyer, if Closing has not occurred on or before July 31,
2015 (the "Outside Date"); provided, however, that the Outside Date shall be
extended to October 30, 2015 if all conditions to Closing set forth in Article
7 shall have been satisfied or waived (or, with respect to conditions to be
satisfied at Closing, are then capable of being satisfied) as of July 31,
2015, other than the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(e) and Section
7.2(d);

(c) by Buyer, if (1) there has been a breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company
pursuant to this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the
conditions specified in Section 7.1 and such breach, inaccuracy or failure has
not been cured by the Company within ten Business Days of the Company's
receipt of written notice of such breach, inaccuracy or failure from Buyer, or
(2) any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 shall not have been, or if
it becomes apparent that any such conditions will not be, fulfilled by the

extension thereof, provided that with respect to clause (c)(1) and (c)(2)
above Buyer and Merger Sub have not waived such condition in writing; or

(d) by the Company, if (1) there has been a breach, inaccuracy or failure to
perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the
conditions specified in Section 7.2 and such breach, inaccuracy or failure has
not been cured by Buyer within ten Business Days of Buyer's receipt of written
notice of such breach, inaccuracy or failure from the Company, or (2) any of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 shall not have been, or if it becomes
apparent that any such conditions will not be, fulfilled by the Outside Date
or, in the case of the condition set forth in Section 7.2(d), any extension
thereof, provided that with respect to clause (d)(1) and (d)(2) above the
Company has not waived such condition in writing.

A termination of this Agreement under any of the preceding clauses (b) through
(d) will be effective without further action by any Party one Business Day
after the Party seeking termination gives to each other Party written notice
of such termination. Notwithstanding any term in this Section 6.4, a Party
will not have the right to terminate this Agreement (except by mutual written
consent pursuant to Section 6.4(a)) if the failure to satisfy any condition to
Closing or consummate the transactions contemplated herein results in any
material respect from the breach by such Party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements herein or in any Ancillary Document (and
any breach by Buyer or Merger Sub will be attributed to the other solely for
purposes of determining if Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section).

6.5 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
6.4, then this Agreement will be of no further force or effect, except for the
terms of Section 5.6 (entitled, "Confidentiality and Publicity"), Section 5.18
(entitled, "Post-Signing Deliveries"), Section 9.2 (entitled, "Expenses"),
Section 9.5 (entitled, "Governing Law"), Section 9.6 (entitled, "Jurisdiction,
Venue and Waiver of Jury Trial"), Section 9.14 (entitled, "Legal
Representation"), Section 9.15 (entitled, "Sellers' Representative and Related
Matters") and this Section 6.5. Upon any termination pursuant to Section 6.4,
no Party will have any further liability or other obligation hereunder or in
connection herewith, except pursuant to a Section listed in the immediately
preceding sentence or for any of the following (in which case this Section 6.5
will not limit any liability or other obligation with respect thereto): (a)
pre-termination fraud, provided that such fraud is of a type of which an
element is intent; or (b) willful or intentional breach by such Party. For the
avoidance of doubt, any breach of this Agreement by Buyer for failing to pay
the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration or deliver the Stock Merger
Consideration upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein
will be deemed an intentional breach by Buyer.

8.2 Adjustment Escrow and Sellers Expense Amount.

(a) Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount. The Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow
Amount will be deposited into an escrow account pursuant to Section 2.3(a) and
the terms of an Escrow Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 8.2(a) with such changes reasonably requested by the Paying/Escrow
Agent (the "Escrow Agreement"). Disbursements from such escrow account will
occur pursuant to the applicable terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. Buyer's only rights regarding the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow
Amount are the use of the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount as
contemplated under Section 2.4 and Buyer will have no other right with respect
thereto.

(b) Sellers Expense Amount. The Sellers Expense Amount will be used and paid
pursuant to the applicable terms of this Agreement or as Sellers'
Representative otherwise determines in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein. The Sellers Expense Amount will be used by Sellers'
Representative only under or in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein, and Buyer will not have any control over, or
right to receive, any of the Sellers Expense Amount or any information
relating thereto. Uses of the Sellers Expense Amount include (1)
indemnification, payment or reimbursement of Sellers' Representative relating
hereto, (2) payment or reimbursement of expenses incurred by Sellers'
Representative relating hereto (including the conduct of any legal defense by
Sellers), (3) payment or reimbursement of the fees and costs of professional
advisors incurred by Sellers' Representative relating hereto or (4) satisfying
any obligation among any of Sellers. The Sellers will not receive any interest
or earnings on the Sellers Expense Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign
to the Sellers' Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise
have had in any such interest or earnings. The Sellers' Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Sellers Expense Amount other
than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Sellers'
Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will
not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes
and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the
event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the completion of the
Sellers' Representative's responsibilities, the Sellers' Representative shall
disburse the balance of the Sellers Expense Amount to Paying/Escrow Agent for
further distribution to the Sellers. For tax purposes, the Sellers Expense
Amount shall be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by
the Sellers at the time of Closing.

and revise) this Agreement and such other documents; therefore, if an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, then this Agreement
and such other documents will be construed as if drafted jointly by the
Parties and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the terms hereof
or thereof. 

9.4 Parties in Interest; Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the Sellers,
each of whom is a third party beneficiary hereof solely with respect to their
rights to receive their respective portion of the Merger Consideration from

whatsoever (including any claim, controversy or dispute of any kind or nature,
whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise, involving a Financing Source
that is in any way related to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt
Financing), shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the domestic
substantive laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice
of law or conflicts of law provision or rule that might otherwise cause the
application of the domestic substantive laws of any other jurisdiction,
provided that all matters relating to the Merger shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota, without
regard to any other principles of conflicts of law.

9.6 Jurisdiction, Venue and Waiver of Jury Trial. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT STATED
OTHERWISE IN SECTION 2.4 OR AS SET FORTH BELOW, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN
MINNEAPOLIS OR SAINT PAUL, MINNESOTA IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY DOCUMENT AND TO THE RESPECTIVE
COURT TO WHICH AN APPEAL OF THE DECISIONS OF ANY SUCH COURT MAY BE TAKEN, AND
EACH PARTY AGREES NOT TO COMMENCE, OR COOPERATE IN OR ENCOURAGE THE
COMMENCEMENT OF, ANY SUCH PROCEEDING, EXCEPT IN SUCH A COURT. EACH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY DO SO, THE DEFENSE OF
AN INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE THEREIN OF SUCH A PROCEEDING. EACH
PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF A COPY OF THE SUMMONS AND
COMPLAINT, AND ANY OTHER PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH PROCEEDING THAT MAY
BE SERVED IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BY ANY METHOD PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING WILL BE
CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY JURISDICTION BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR
BY ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE LAW. Each party hereby expressly
waives to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law any right it may have
to a trial by jury in respect of any Proceeding directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Document, or
any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Debt Financing). Each party (i) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented TO IT,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it
and the other parties have been induced to enter into this Agreement and
Ancillary Documents, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers
and certifications in this SECTION 9.6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of
the Parties agrees that it will not, and it will cause its Affiliates not to,
bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, in any way relating to the Financing
Sources, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than any state or Federal court sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan within the State of New York.

9.7 Entire Agreement; Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement, including the
Schedules and Exhibits and other agreements referenced herein, including the
Escrow Agreement, constitutes the entire Agreement among the Parties
pertaining to the subject matter herein and supersedes any prior
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement 

or similar assurance (whether direct or indirect, written or oral, or
statutory, express or implied) of any Party regarding such subject matter (and
there is no other representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or similar
assurance of any Party regarding such subject matter). No supplement,
modification or amendment hereof will be binding unless expressed as such and
executed in writing by each Party affected thereby (except as contemplated in
Section 9.9); provided, however, that (i) if any such amendment or waiver
shall by Applicable Law require further approval of the Shareholders, the
effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of
Shareholders holding at least a majority of the voting power of the
outstanding Shares and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, this Section 9.7, Section 9.4, Section 9.5, Section 9.6,
Section 9.8 and Section 9.16 (and any other provision of this Agreement to the
extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of such
provision would modify the substance of such Sections) and the definition of
"Company Material Adverse Effect" may not be amended, supplemented, waived or
otherwise modified without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.
No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or
on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party
taking such action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein. No waiver of any term hereof will be binding
unless expressed as such in a document executed by the Party making such
waiver. No waiver of any term hereof will be a waiver of any other term
hereof, whether or not similar, nor will any such waiver be a continuing
waiver beyond its stated terms. Failure to enforce strict compliance with any
term hereof will not be a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any existing
or subsequent failure to comply.

9.8 Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any right or
obligation hereunder will be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred (by
operation of law or otherwise) by any Party without the prior written consent
of each other Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except that at or after Closing Buyer may collaterally assign this
Agreement and Buyer's or the Surviving Corporation's rights under any Seller
Ancillary Document in connection with any indebtedness for borrowed money of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any Acquired Company); provided that
no such assignment, delegation or transfer will relieve the assigning,
delegating or transferring Party of any obligation hereunder. This Agreement
will be binding on and inure to the benefit of the respective permitted
successors and assigns of the Parties. Any purported assignment, delegation or
other transfer not permitted by this Section is void.

9.9 Severability; Blue Pencil. The terms of this Agreement will, where
possible, be interpreted and enforced so as to sustain their legality and
enforceability, read as if they cover only the specific situation to which
they are being applied and enforced to the fullest extent permissible under
Applicable Law. If any term of this Agreement is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
then all other terms of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force
and effect, and such term automatically will be amended so that it is valid,
legal and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, but
as close to the Parties' original intent as is permissible.

9.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including
via .pdf), each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together
will constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement may be delivered
by facsimile or other electronic means (including via .pdf), and the receiving
Party may rely on the receipt of such documents so delivered as if the
original had been received.

9.11 Disclosure Schedules. Certain information is contained in the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure Schedule that may not be required
to be disclosed pursuant hereto and doing so will not imply that such
information or any other information is required to be disclosed. Inclusion of
such information will not establish any level of materiality or similar
threshold or be an admission that any of such information is material to the
business, assets, liabilities, financial position, operations or results of
operations of any Person or otherwise material regarding such Person. Each
item disclosed in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Buyer
Disclosure Schedule in a manner that makes its relevance to one or more other
sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Buyer Disclosure Schedule
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure will be deemed to have been
appropriately included in each such other section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Buyer Disclosure Schedule (notwithstanding the presence or absence
of any reference in or to any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or
Buyer Disclosure Schedule). 

9.12 No Survival. None of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered under this Agreement shall survive
the Merger Effective Time. This Section 9.12 shall not limit any covenant or
agreement of the Parties to this Agreement that, by its terms, contemplates
performance after the Merger Effective Time (including those contained in
Section 9.15).

9.13 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that (1) this
Section 9.13 is reasonable and necessary to ensure that each Party receives
the expected benefits of the Merger, (2) each Party has refused to enter into
this Agreement in the absence of this Section 9.13, (3) each Party (and
Sellers) may be damaged irreparably if this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its terms or otherwise is breached and (4) in such case
monetary damages alone may not be an adequate remedy and there may not be an
adequate remedy at law. Therefore, a Party (in addition to all other remedies
it may have) will be entitled to seek an injunction and other equitable relief
(without posting any bond or other security) to prevent breaches hereof and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and its terms.

9.14 Legal Representation. Each Party acknowledges and agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, that (a) Faegre Baker Daniels LLP, an
Illinois limited liability partnership (along with any predecessor or
successor, "FaegreBD"), has served as legal counsel to the Acquired Companies
from time to time and that FaegreBD's services for the Acquired Companies have
included representation regarding aspects of the transactions contemplated
herein and other matters and (b) after Closing, FaegreBD may serve as legal
counsel to the Sellers' Representative, any Seller, any Affiliate of any
Seller, or any director, officer, member, partner or employee of any of the
foregoing in connection with the transactions contemplated herein (including
any claim or other Proceeding relating hereto) or any other matter,
notwithstanding such other representation (or any continued representation).
Each Party (on its and its Affiliates behalf) hereby consents to such
representation and waives any conflict of interest relating thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) FaegreBD does not currently represent any
Seller (and there is no attorney‑client relationship between FaegreBD and any
Seller) and (b) the receipt by FaegreBD of any notice or communication
hereunder (including as contemplated under Section 9.1) or any action on
behalf of any other Party does not create any such representation or
relationship. In addition, all communications involving attorney-client
confidences among the Acquired Companies and FaegreBD in the course of the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein will be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to
the Sellers (and not the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries) and may be
controlled by Sellers' Representative. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (a) upon and after the Closing, (1) the Sellers and their
Affiliates (and not the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries) will be the
sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated herein
(collectively, the "Pre-Sale Communications"), and none of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries will be a holder thereof, (2) to the extent
that files of FaegreBD with respect to the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein constitute property of
the client, only the Sellers and their Affiliates (and not the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries) will hold such property rights and (3)
FaegreBD will have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose the Pre-Sale
Communications of files pertaining to the Pre-Sale Communications to the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-
client relationship between FaegreBD and the Acquired Companies or otherwise;
and (b) it would be impracticable to remove from the records (including emails
and other electronic files) of the Acquired Companies any privileged
communications with FaegreBD and therefore the Parties agree that no waiver of
any applicable attorney-client, work product or other privilege shall result
if such material is allowed to remain in the files of the Surviving
Corporation and its Affiliates.

9.15 Sellers' Representative and Related Matters.

(a) Appointment; Sellers' Representative's Limited Role. Shareholder
Representative Services LLC is hereby appointed as the representative, agent
and attorney-in-fact of each Seller for all purposes of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and any agreements
ancillary hereto. Shareholder Representative Services LLC or any successor of
Shareholder Representative Services LLC hereunder ("Sellers' Representative")
is only a party to this Agreement for the purpose of performing as Sellers'
Representative. Sellers' Representative has no obligation to incur or pay any
expense in connection herewith, including that Sellers' Representative has no
obligation (indemnification or otherwise) for any Loss of any other Party.
Sellers shall be responsible to Buyer and Merger Sub for any breach by
Sellers' Representative of its obligations hereunder. Sellers' Representative
may resign at any time. Sellers' Representative may be changed or replaced,
and any vacancy in the 

position of Sellers' Representative may be filled, in each case by affirmative
action of Sellers holding a majority of the economic interests in the
remaining portion of the Sellers Expense Amount. No bond will be required of
Sellers' Representative. Sellers' Representative will inform Buyer of any such
resignation or other change.

(b) Buyer's Reliance. Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation will be
entitled to rely on all statements, actions, representations and decisions of
Sellers' Representative as being the binding acts of all Sellers or any of
them, notwithstanding any communication from any Seller to the contrary (other
than communication regarding termination or replacement of Sellers'
Representative pursuant to this Section 9.15).

(c) Exculpation; Indemnification. The Sellers' Representative will incur no
liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by the Sellers'
Representative in connection with its services pursuant to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and any other agreements or documents ancillary hereto,
except in the event of liability directly resulting from the Sellers'
Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Sellers will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers' Representative from and
against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "Representative Losses")
arising out of or in connection with the Sellers' Representative's execution
and performance of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any other
agreements or documents ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative
Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Sellers' Representative, the
Sellers' Representative will reimburse the Sellers the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Sellers'
Representative by the Sellers, any such Representative Losses may be recovered
by the Sellers' Representative from (i) the funds in the Sellers Expense
Amount, (ii) the amounts of the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount at such
time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Sellers;
provided, that while this section allows the Sellers' Representative to be
paid from the Sellers Expense Amount and the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow
Amount, this does not relieve the Sellers from their obligation to promptly
pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Sellers' Representative from seeking any remedies available to it
at law or otherwise. The Sellers acknowledge and agree that this Section 9.15
will survive the resignation or removal of the Sellers' Representative or the
termination of this Agreement and will survive the Merger Effective Time.

9.16 No Recourse Against Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything that may
be expressed or implied in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Company, Sellers' Representative nor any of their respective Affiliates or
their respective Affiliates' stockholders, partners, members, officers,
directors, employees, controlling persons, agents and representatives shall
have any recourse or claims against any Financing Source in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing) or any documents or instruments
delivered in connection herewith or therewith, whether by the enforcement of
any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise. In
addition, in no event will any Financing Source be liable in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing) for consequential, special,
exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any loss of profits,
business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortious nature. For
avoidance of doubt, (a) in no event shall this Section 9.16 apply to Buyer,
whether before or after the Closing, and (b) from and after the Closing, the
foregoing shall not modify or alter in any respect any provision of any
definitive loan documentation between or among Buyer, the Company (or the
Surviving Corporation), and any of their subsidiaries and any Financing Source
entered into in connection with or as contemplated by this Agreement, and in
the event of a conflict between the foregoing and any provision in any such
definitive loan documentation, the provisions of such definitive loan
documentation shall govern and control.
