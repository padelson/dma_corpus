WHEREAS, after reviewing, evaluating and negotiating the merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), the Special Committee
has unanimously determined, and the Board of Directors of the Company has
unanimously, by those present, determined, that it is in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into
this Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub providing for the Merger, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and each of
the Special Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company has approved

ARTICLE II 
 

  

  

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

  

Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Sections 2.1(b), 2.1(d) and
2.1(e), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such shares, collectively, "Company Common Stock," and each, a "Share"),
other than any Cancelled Shares (to the extent provided for in Section 2.1(b))
and any Dissenting Shares (to the extent provided for in Section 2.1(e)),
shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent
the right to receive $7.75 per share in cash, without any interest thereon
(the "Merger Consideration"). All Shares that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1
shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than
the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

  

  

(b) Company, Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares. Each Share that is owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time or held by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of
third parties) (the "Cancelled Shares") shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common
stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number
of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  

  

(d) Adjustments. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change, provided,
that nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to permit the Company
or its Subsidiaries to take any action that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

  

  

(e) Dissenting Shares.

  

  

(i) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
holder of which (A) has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto
in writing, (B) has demanded its rights to appraisal in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL, and (C) has not effectively withdrawn or lost its
rights to appraisal (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall be converted into or
represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1(a). By virtue of the Merger, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist and shall represent the right to receive only those
rights provided under the DGCL. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of
Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights
or other rights of a member or equity owner of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.1(e), if any holder of
Shares who demands dissenters\' rights shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent or its rights
of appraisal, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence
of such event, such holder\'s Shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and
shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

  

  

(iii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written demands
for dissenters\' rights of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
which relate to any such demand for dissenters\' rights and (B) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for dissenters\' rights under the DGCL. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to any demands for dissenters\' rights or offer to settle or settle
any such demands.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Payment Deposit. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited (x) with one or more paying agents selected by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent"), in trust
for the benefit of holders of the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (less the amount required to be held in
the Option Proceeds Account pursuant to Section 5.5(a)(v)) in exchange for all
of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
the Cancelled Shares and the Dissenting Shares), payable upon due surrender of
the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Shares ("Certificates") (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares")
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund") and (y) to the extent necessary, with the
Surviving Corporation the Option and Stock-Based Consideration payable
pursuant to Section 5.5.

  

  

(b) Payment Procedures.

  

  

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, (x) the Paying
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually agree) and (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and (y) the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each holder of a
Company Stock Option or a Company Stock-Based Award, a check in an amount due
and payable to such holder pursuant to Section 5.5 of this Agreement in
respect of such Company Stock Option or Company Stock-Based Award.

  

  

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent (including a declaration form in which the holder of
record states whether the holder is a resident of Israel as defined in the
Income Tax Ordinance of Israel (New Version), 1961 (the "Ordinance")) the
holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a check in an amount equal to the product of (x) the
number of Shares represented by such holder\'s properly surrendered
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be
paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if
the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under
this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), the
Ordinance or any provision of U.S. or Israeli state or local law, or any other
applicable foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted, such withheld or deducted
amounts shall be (i) paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii)
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

  

  

(c) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
a check in the proper amount pursuant to this Article II.

  

  

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the
former holders of Shares for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of
Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with Section 2.2
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their
claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due
surrender of their Shares.

ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such
power or authority, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or to
prevent or materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. As used in this Agreement, any reference to any facts,
circumstances, events or changes having a "Company Material Adverse Effect"
means such facts, circumstances, events, or changes that are materially
adverse to the business assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or results
of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, but shall

generally affecting the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate or the economy or the financial, credit or capital markets in the
United States or elsewhere in the world, including regulatory conditions or
developments or changes in interest or exchange rates, so long as such facts,
circumstances, events or changes do not adversely affect the Company and its
Subsidiaries in a materially disproportionate manner relative to other
participants in the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate, or (b) arising out of, resulting from or attributable to (i) the
announcement of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the reaction of any customers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to such announcement); provided that this clause

modifies or qualifies the representations and warranties in Section 3.3(b) or
Section 3.3(c), (ii) any stockholder litigation arising from allegations of a
breach of fiduciary duty or other violation of applicable Law relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent

representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement,
(iii) changes in applicable Law, GAAP or accounting standards, (iv) changes in
the market price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock, (v) changes in
any analyst\'s recommendations, any financial strength rating or any other
recommendations or ratings as to the Company or its Subsidiaries (including,
in and of itself, any failure to meet analyst projections), (vi) the failure,
in and of itself, of the Company to meet any internal or public projections,
forecasts, targets or estimates of financial or operating performance (it
being understood, however, that any facts, circumstances, events or changes
causing or contributing to any change or failure described in clauses (iv),
(v) and (vi) may, except as otherwise provided in this definition, be taken
into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has
occurred) or (vii) an outbreak or escalation of war, armed hostilities, acts
of terrorism, political instability or other national or international
calamity, crisis or emergency or any governmental or other response or
reaction to any of the foregoing, whether in Israel or elsewhere, so long as
with respect to items (iii) and (vii), such facts, circumstances, events or
changes do not adversely affect the Company and its Subsidiaries in a
materially disproportionate manner relative to other participants in the
industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate. The Company has

and the Company Foreign Filings complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Exchange Act, and any
applicable Israeli Laws, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and

maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. These disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company\'s
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"). The
Company\'s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company\'s internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the

December 31, 2010, and such assessment concluded that such controls were

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

  

  

Except as disclosed in the definitive disclosure schedule delivered by Parent

the Company that the statements contained in this Article IV are true and
correct as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date (or, if a specific
date is indicated in any such statement, as of such specified date):

  

  

Section 4.1 Qualification; Organization, Subsidiaries, etc. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has
all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing,
qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay or materially
impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a "Parent Material Adverse
Effect"). Parent has made available to the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement a true and complete copy of the certificate of incorporation and

validly authorized by the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and by
Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and, except for the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub

United States ("CFIUS"), or any similar foreign laws, (v) the RTPA, and (vi)

of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is necessary for the consummation
by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except for such authorizations, consents, approvals or filings, that, if not
obtained or made, would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(c) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement does
not, and, except as described in Section 4.2(b), the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement will not (i) result in any violation of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or to the
loss of a material benefit under any contract binding upon Parent or Merger
Sub or result in the creation of any material Lien (other than Permitted
Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii)
conflict with or result in any violation of any provision of the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws or other equivalent organizational document, in
each case as amended, of Parent or Merger Sub or (iii) conflict with or
violate any applicable Laws, other than, in the case of clauses (i) - (iii),
any such violation, conflict, default, termination, cancellation,
acceleration, right, loss or Lien that would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 4.3 Investigations; Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement,
there is no investigation or review pending (or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened) by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries which would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, and there are no actions, suits, inquiries,
investigations or proceedings pending (or, to Parent\'s knowledge, threatened)
against or affecting Parent or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
properties at law or in equity before, and there are no orders, judgments or
decrees of, or before, any Governmental Entity, in each case, which would
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.4 Proxy Statement; Other Information. None of the information
provided by Parent or its Subsidiaries to be included in the Proxy Statement
will (i) at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments
or supplements thereto and (ii) at the time of the Company Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes
any representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the
Company, by any of its Representatives, or by anyone else, which is contained

Section 4.5 Financing. Section 4.5 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets

to provide equity financing sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the
Merger Consideration to Parent and/or Merger Sub, to which the Company is a
third-party beneficiary (the "Financing Commitments") pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions thereof. As of the date hereof, the
Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn
or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect and neither
Parent nor Merger Sub is in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth
therein and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or failure to
satisfy a condition precedent set forth therein. Subject to the accuracy of
the relevant representations and warranties of the Company in Article III, the
proceeds from such Financing Commitments constitute all of the financing
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and are
sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s
obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger
Consideration and the Option and Stock-Based Consideration (and any fees and
expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation).
The Financing Commitments contain all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of the funding party to make the equity financing thereunder
available to Parent and/or Merger Sub on the terms therein. As of the date
hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the Financing Commitments will not be satisfied or that the
proceeds of the Financing Commitments will not be available to Parent on the
Closing Date; provided that Parent and Merger Sub are not making any
representation regarding the accuracy of the representations and warranties
set forth in Article III, or compliance by the Company with its obligations
hereunder. As of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other
agreements, contracts or arrangements to which Parent is a party related to
the funding of the full amount contemplated by the Financing Commitments other
than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments.

stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or
a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub has
outstanding no option, warrant, right, or any other agreement pursuant to
which any person other than Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger
Sub. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date of this
Agreement and has, and prior to the Effective Time will have, no assets,
liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its
formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other

Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor are there any agreements, arrangements
or understandings to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with

Disclosure Schedule and the Company SEC Documents), and neither the Company
nor any other person shall be subject to any liability (other than with
respect to any claims for fraud) to Parent or any other person resulting from

carry on its business as presently conducted or as proposed to be conducted.

Section 5.2 Investigation.

  

  

(a) The Company shall afford to Parent and to its officers, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and agents and
other representatives (collectively, "Representatives") reasonable access
during normal business hours, throughout the period prior to the earlier of
the Effective Time and the Termination Date, to its and its Subsidiaries\'
properties, contracts, commitments, books and records, employees, accountants
and any report, schedule or other document filed or received by it pursuant to
the requirements of applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not be required to afford such access if it would unreasonably
disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause
a material violation of any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, would cause a material risk of a loss of privilege to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any
applicable Law (it being agreed that the parties shall make appropriate
alternative disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which any of the
foregoing would apply), nor shall Parent or any of its Representatives be
permitted to perform any onsite environmental study with respect to any
property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) Parent hereby agrees that all information provided to it or its
Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be Confidential
Information, as such term is used in, and shall be treated in accordance with,
the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of May 25, 2011, between the Company
and Citigroup Venture Capital International (the "Confidentiality Agreement").
The parties acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, after the date hereof, Parent and
its affiliates may engage in discussions with potential equity financing
sources in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
may provide Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) to any such potential equity financing source that has agreed with
Parent or its affiliates to comply with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) No investigation by and of the parties or their respective
representatives, whether prior to or after the date hereof, shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other parties set
forth herein.

  

  

Section 5.3 No Solicitation.

  

  

(a) Subject to Sections 5.3(b)-(d), during the period beginning on the date of
this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
Termination Date, the Company agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary of the
Company shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or take any other action to knowingly
facilitate, any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or
announcement of, any Alternative Proposal, (ii) participate in any
negotiations regarding an Alternative Proposal with, or furnish any nonpublic
information regarding an Alternative Proposal to, any person that has made or,
to the Company\'s knowledge, is considering making an Alternative Proposal,
(iii) engage in discussions regarding an Alternative Proposal with any person
that has made or, to the Company\'s knowledge, is considering making an
Alternative Proposal, except to notify such person as to the existence of the
provisions of this Section 5.3, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend or publicly
propose to approve, endorse or recommend any Alternative Proposal or (v) enter
into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or any agreement or
arrangement, oral or written, with respect to any Alternative Proposal (except
for confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 5.3(b)). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3 by any
directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3 by the Company.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 5.3(a), from the date
of this Agreement to the earlier of the date of the Company Stockholder
Approval or the Termination Date, if the Company receives a bona fide written
Alternative Proposal that did not arise from a breach by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives of Section 5.3(a),
that (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) which the Special Committee
and the Board of Directors of the Company determine in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors) could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company may take
the following actions after providing prior written notice to Parent of its
intent to take such actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the third
party making such Alternative Proposal, if, and only if, (1) prior to so
furnishing such information, the Company receives from the third party an
executed confidentiality agreement containing terms no less favorable to the
Company than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and (2) as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) after
furnishing such information to the third party, the Company provides such
information to Parent to the extent not previously made available to Parent
and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party with
respect to the Alternative Proposal. The Company shall not terminate, waive,
amend, release or modify any material provision of any confidentiality
agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to
any Alternative Proposal.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of any inquiries, proposals or
offers received by, any request for information from, or any negotiations
sought to be initiated or continued with, either the Company or its
Representatives concerning an Alternative Proposal or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal, notify Parent orally and in
writing and disclose the identity of the other party and the material terms of
such inquiry, offer, proposal or request and, in the case of written materials
provided to the Company, provide Parent copies or written summaries of such
materials as promptly as reasonably practicable. The Company will keep Parent
informed on a reasonably prompt basis of the status and any discussions or
negotiations (including amendments and proposed amendments) relating to any
Alternative Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or request.

  

  

(d) Except as set forth in this subsection (d), neither the Special Committee
nor the Board of Directors of the Company shall withdraw, modify or qualify,
or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub, the Recommendation or publicly announce that it has
resolved to take such action (any such action, a "Change in Recommendation").
Prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Special
Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company may make a "Change of
Recommendation" if the Special Committee and the Board of Directors of the
Company has concluded in good faith, after consultation with the Company\'s
and the Special Committee\'s outside legal advisors, that the failure to
effect a Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors\' exercise of their fiduciary obligations to
the Company\'s stockholders under applicable Law and (ii) the Company may
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an Alternative Proposal if
the Special Committee and Board of Directors of the Company have made the
determination in clause (i) in response to a bona fide written Alternative
Proposal that did not arise from a breach by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives of Section 5.3(a),
have determined in good faith, after consultation with their financial
advisors and outside legal advisor, that such Alternative Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal and, concurrently with entering into such definitive
agreement, the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g)
and pays the applicable termination fee as a condition to such termination;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be entitled to effect a Change
in Recommendation or enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal unless and until (A) three (3) Business Days have elapsed following
Parent\'s receipt of a written notice (a "Notice of Recommendation Change")
from the Company advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action
and specifying the reasons therefor, including, in the case of an intention to
take action with respect to an Alternative Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of the Alternative Proposal that is the basis of such action
specified in such Notice of Recommendation Change and a copy of the then-
current form of any related agreements, and stating that the Company intends
to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g) or effect a Change in
Recommendation, as applicable and (B) the Company has complied in all material
respects with this Section 5.3 and (C) in the case of a termination pursuant
to Section 7.1(g) to enter into an agreement for a Superior Proposal, the
Company has, within the same business day, paid, or caused to be paid to,
Parent all amounts due pursuant to Section 7.2 as result of a termination
pursuant to Section 7.1(g). Any material amendment or modification to any
Superior Proposal, or any change to the amount or form of consideration in a
Superior Proposal, made following delivery of a Notice of Recommendation
Change will be deemed to be a new Superior Proposal for purposes of this
Section 5.3 and shall require delivery of a new Notice of Recommendation
Change and the expiration of a new three (3) Business Day notice period
hereunder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided that
any such disclosure will be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the
Special Committee and Board of Directors of the Company publicly reaffirms the
Recommendation within five (5) business days of such disclosure.

  

  

(f) As used in this Agreement, "Alternative Proposal" shall mean any proposal,
offer or inquiry made by any person prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval (other than a proposal, offer or inquiry by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries) for (i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation or similar transaction involving the Company, (ii) the acquisition
by any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) the acquisition by any person or
"group" of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock.

  

  

(g) As used in this Agreement "Superior Proposal" shall mean a bona fide
written Alternative Proposal that did not arise from a breach by the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives of Section
5.3(a) made by any person on terms that (i) provides for the acquisition of a
majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or all
or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
(ii) the Special Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company determine
in good faith, after consultation with the Company\'s and the Special
Committee\'s financial and outside legal advisors, and considering such
factors as the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company, as
applicable, consider to be appropriate (including the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such proposal), are more favorable, from a financial point of
view, to the Company\'s stockholders than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to modify the terms hereof).

  

  

Section 5.4 Filings; Other Actions.

  

  

(a) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall each use all reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken such actions as may be required to be
taken under the Exchange Act any other federal securities Laws, and under any
applicable state or foreign securities or "blue sky" Laws or rules of the ISA
or TASE in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Proxy Statement. In connection with the
Merger and the Company Meeting, Parent and the Company shall prepare, and the
Company shall file with the SEC, as soon as practicable, the Proxy Statement
relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Company and Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to
respond to the comments of the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the Company\'s stockholders, all as promptly as reasonably
practicable; provided, however, that prior to the filing of the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment thereto or any response to comments of the SEC),
the Company shall consult with Parent with respect to such filings and shall
afford Parent or its Representatives reasonable opportunity to comment
thereon. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company with any information
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement which may be required under applicable
Law and/or which is reasonably requested by the Company. The Company shall
notify Parent promptly of the receipt of comments of the SEC and of any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
for additional information, and will promptly supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or members of their respective staff, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. If at any time prior to the
Company Meeting any event should occur which is required by applicable Law to
be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the
Company will promptly inform Parent. In such case, the Company, with the
cooperation of Parent, will, upon learning of such event, promptly prepare and
file such amendment or supplement with the SEC to the extent required by
applicable Law and shall mail such amendment or supplement to the Company\'s
shareholders to the extent required by applicable Law; provided, however, that
prior to such filing, the Company shall consult with Parent with respect to
such amendment or supplement and shall afford Parent or its Representatives
reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Company and Parent shall each use reasonable best efforts in order to
lift any injunctions or remove any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(c) The Company shall (i) take all action necessary in accordance with the
DGCL and its amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the
"Company Meeting"), and (ii) unless the Board of Directors of the Company has
made a Change of Recommendation in compliance with Section 5.3(d), include the
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and use reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms pursuant to
Article VII, the Company shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders at
the Company Meeting even if there has occurred a Change of Recommendation.

  

  

Section 5.5 Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards; Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards.

  

  

(i) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company
Stock Option") granted under the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted into the right
to receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to
the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option and (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option, with the aggregate amount of such
payment rounded to the nearest cent (the aggregate amount of such cash
hereinafter referred to as the "Option Consideration") less such amounts as
are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of Tax
Law with respect to the making of such payment.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to
receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured in whole or in
part by the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock granted under
the Company Stock Plans or Company Benefit Plans (including restricted stock
units, phantom units, deferred stock units and dividend equivalents), other
than Restricted Shares and Company Stock Options (each, other than Restricted
Shares and Company Stock Options, a "Company Stock-Based Award"), whether
vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock, shall become fully vested and shall entitle the holder
thereof to receive, at the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the
Merger Consideration in respect of each Share underlying a particular Company
Stock-Based Award (the aggregate amount of such cash, together with the Option
Consideration, hereinafter referred to as the "Option and Stock-Based
Consideration") less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted
under the Code or any provision of Tax Law with respect to the making of such
payment.

  

  

(iii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted
Company Common Stock (the "Restricted Shares") shall vest in full and be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.1(a), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted
under the Code or any provision of Tax Law with respect to the making of such
payment.

  

  

(iv) The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company shall
make such amendments to or make such determinations with respect to Company
Stock Options, Company Stock-Based Awards and Restricted Shares to implement
the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5.

  

  

(v) From and after the date hereof and prior to the Termination Date, the
Company shall deposit all proceeds received by the Company from the exercise
of Company Stock Options into a segregated account (the "Option Proceeds
Account"). At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deposit with
the Paying Agent in cash all amounts held in the Option Proceeds Account.

  

  

(b) Employee Matters.

  

  

(i) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor all Company Benefit
Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time (without giving
effect to any amendments thereto after the Effective Time except if consented
to by the affected party). For a period of one (1) year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
current employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries ("Company Employees")
salary, wages, and benefits (but excluding equity and equity-based
compensation) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the
compensation and benefits provided to Company Employees immediately before the
Effective Time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee shall be credited with
his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (A) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the
Merger (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), and (B) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits
to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would
not have been waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee\'s participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

  

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.5 are for the sole benefit of the parties
to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or
shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including for the
avoidance of doubt any current or former employees, directors or independent
contractors of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other
rights or remedies with respect to the matters provided for in this Section
5.5. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person. No provision in this Agreement
shall modify or amend any Company Benefit Plan unless this Agreement
explicitly states that the provision "amends" such Company Benefit Plan. This
shall not prevent the parties entitled to enforce this Agreement from
enforcing any provision in this Agreement, but no other party shall be
entitled to enforce any provision in this Agreement on the grounds that it is
an amendment to such Company Benefit Plan. If a party not entitled to enforce
this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to enforce any provision in
this Agreement as an amendment to such Company Benefit Plan and that provision
is construed to be such an amendment despite not being explicitly designated
as one in this Agreement, that provision shall lapse retroactively as of its
inception, thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 5.6 Reasonable Best Efforts.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use (and cause its affiliates to use) its reasonable
best efforts (subject to, and in accordance with, applicable Law) to take
promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions, and to do promptly, or
cause to be done promptly, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties
in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) obtaining all necessary actions
or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals, including the Company
Approvals and the Parent Approvals, from Governmental Entities and making all
necessary registrations and filings and taking all steps as may be necessary
to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by,
any Governmental Entity, (ii) obtaining all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties, (iii) defending any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iv) executing and delivering any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) as soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, make their respective filings and thereafter make
any other required submissions under the HSR Act; (ii) as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, make their respective filings and thereafter
make any other required submissions and undertakings under the RTPA and the
Encouragement of Research and Development in Industry Law, 5744 1984 of the
State of Israel; (iii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each
other in (x) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or
consents, permits, authorizations, waivers or approvals are required to be
obtained from, any third parties or other Governmental Entities in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely making all such filings and
timely seeking all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals; (iv)
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions
and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby;
including that Parent shall (x) propose, negotiate, commit to and agree to
effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such immaterial assets or businesses of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise take or commit to take actions
that after the Closing Date would limit the freedom of Parent or its
Subsidiaries\' (including the Surviving Corporation\'s) freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries\'
(including the Surviving Corporation\'s) businesses, product lines or assets,
in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order
in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing
or materially delaying the Closing; provided that notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their affiliates be obligated to (nor shall the Company) propose, commit to or
agree to effect any action (1) the effectiveness or consummation of which is
not condition on the Closing or (2) that individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to deprive Parent of the material benefits of the
bargains contemplated by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise materially impact any of the other businesses of Parent or any of
its affiliates; and (v) subject to applicable legal limitations and the
instructions of any Governmental Entity, keep each other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. The Company and Parent
shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection
with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental Entity. Each of
the Company and Parent agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the agreements of the parties
contained in this Section 5.6, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of the Company and Parent
shall reasonably cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.6 shall limit a party\'s right to terminate this

with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) furnishing
Parent and its potential financing sources with such financial and other
information as may be reasonably requested, (ii) using commercially reasonable

any obligations contained in all such agreements and documents shall be
executed and effective no earlier than the Closing, (v) at least five (5)
calendar days prior to the Closing Date, providing all documentation and other
information about the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as is reasonably
requested in writing by Parent at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the
Closing Date which relates to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations including without limitation the USA PATRIOT
Act and (vi) taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the

after the Effective Time to the extent direct borrowings or debt incurrence by
the Company is contemplated by such financing. The Company hereby consents to
the reasonable use of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' logos in
connection with any such financing, provided that such logos are used solely
in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their logos and on such other
customary terms and conditions as the Company shall reasonably impose. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of any such
financing is not a condition to the Closing, and reaffirms its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and
independently of the availability of any such financing subject to fulfillment
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that the Company (prior to the Effective Time) and its
affiliates and its and their respective Representatives shall not have any
responsibility for, or incur any liability to any person under, any financing
that Parent and Merger Sub may raise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided pursuant to this
Section 5.11 and the Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several
basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with such financing and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than information provided in writing specifically for such use by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its affiliates). Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the financing
contemplated by this Section 5.11.

status of, and any material developments in, any such matter.

  

  

Section 5.13 Notification of Certain Matters. Prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the Termination Date, Parent shall give prompt notice to
the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of (a) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to
occur is reasonably expected to cause any representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, or (b) any material failure of Parent and Merger Sub
or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or
agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. The delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the
conditions to such party's obligation to consummate the Merger.

execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable law, any claim that (i) the suit,
action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii)
the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced in or
by such courts.

  

  

(b) The Company hereby agrees that specific performance shall be its sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to breaches by Parent or Merger Sub or any other
Person or otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Financing Commitments and
that it may not seek or accept any other form of relief that may be available
for breach under this Agreement or the Financing Commitments or otherwise in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including monetary damages). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a court of
competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger pursuant to a claim for
specific performance brought against Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Section 8.5 and has instead granted an award of damages for such alleged
breach against Parent or any of the Financing Sources, the Company may enforce
such award and accept damages for such alleged breach only if, within two (2)
weeks following such award, Parent and Merger Sub are not willing to
consummate the Merger in accordance with Article I of this Agreement. In
addition, the Company agrees to cause any legal action or proceeding still
proceeding to be dismissed with prejudice at such time as Parent and Merger
Sub consummate the Merger in accordance with Article I of this Agreement or
are otherwise willing to do so.

  

  

  

(c) With respect to any claim, suit, action or proceeding of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, involving any sources of debt or equity financing related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, together with their respective
affiliates (the "Financing Sources") arising out of or relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties agrees, that
(i) such claims, suits, actions or proceedings shall be brought and determined
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or in the event (but only in
the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such
action or proceeding, in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware, and (ii) it shall not bring or permit any of its affiliates to bring
or support anyone else in bringing any such claim, suit, action or proceeding
in any other court. The parties further agree that the Financing Sources shall
be beneficiaries of any liability cap and all other limitations on remedies
and damages in this Agreement and that the Financing Sources are express third
party beneficiaries of this Section 8.5(c).

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
agrees that (i) the maximum aggregate liability of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Financing Sources relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Financing Commitments or in
respect of any other document or theory in law or equity or in respect of oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise,
shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the Financing
Commitments, and in no event shall the Company seek to recover any damages in
excess of such amount and (ii) no Person other than Parent, Merger Sub and the
Financing Sources shall have any obligation to the Company relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Financing Commitments or in respect of any other document or
theory in law or equity or in respect of oral representations made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at law,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, and that no personal liability whatsoever
shall attach to, be imposed on, or otherwise be incurred by any former,
current or future director, officer, Affiliate (other than Parent, Merger Sub
and the Financing Sources), employee, general or limited partner, member,
manager or stockholder of the Parent, Merger Sub and the Financing Sources or
any of their respective successors or permitted assignees or any former,
current or future director, officer, Affiliate (other than Parent, Merger Sub
and the Financing Sources), employee, general or limited partner, member,
manager or stockholder of any of the foregoing, as such, for any obligations
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Financing Sources or any of their respective
successors or permitted assignees relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing
Commitments.

FINANCING SOURCES) OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

given, and such notice shall be deemed to have been delivered as of the date
so telecommunicated, emailed or hand delivered to the recipient, one (1)
business day following sending by overnight delivery service, or five (5)
business days following sending by certified or registered mail. Any party to
this Agreement may notify any other party of any changes to the address or any
of the other details specified in this paragraph; provided, however, that such
notification shall only be effective on the date specified in such notice or
five (5) business days after the notice is given, whichever is later.
Rejection or other refusal to accept or the inability to deliver because of
changed address of which no notice was given shall be deemed to be receipt of
the notice as of the date of such rejection, refusal or inability to deliver.

  

  

Section 8.8 Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

  

  

Section 8.9 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 8.10 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(including the exhibits and schedules hereto) and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and thereof
and, except, (i) as provided in Section 8.5 and Section 8.6, which shall be
enforceable by each Financing Source and its successors and assigns (and to
which each of the foregoing is an express third party beneficiary) and (ii)
after the Effective Time, for the provisions of Sections 2.1, 5.5(a) and 5.9,
is not intended to and shall not confer upon any person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. No representation, warranty,
inducement, promise, understanding or condition not set forth in this
Agreement has been made or relied upon by any of the parties hereto.

  

  

Section 8.11 Amendments; Waivers. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
the Company (acting through the Special Committee, if then in existence),
Parent and Merger Sub, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom
the waiver is to be effective; provided, however, that after receipt of
Company Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or wavier shall by
applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq
Stock Market require further approval of the stockholders of the Company, the
effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of
the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

  

  

Section 8.12 Headings. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement
are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or
interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this Agreement is for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.13 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings
when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant
thereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of
such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein
or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor
statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and
negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by
all the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 8.14 Disclosure Schedules. The Company Disclosure Schedules shall each
be arranged in Sections corresponding to the numbered sections contained in
this Agreement, and the disclosure in any section shall qualify (a) the
corresponding section of this Agreement and (b) any other Section of this
Agreement to the extent that it is readily apparent from a reading of such
disclosure that it is applicable to such Section. The inclusion of any
information in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is
required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or
is reasonably expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or is
outside the ordinary course of business.

  

  

Section 8.15 Definitions.

  

  

(a) References in this Agreement to "Subsidiaries" of any party shall mean any

which (i) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities are on the date
of this Agreement directly or indirectly owned by such party, or (ii) such
party or any Subsidiary of such party is a general partner (excluding
partnerships in which such party or any Subsidiary of such party does not have
a majority of the voting interests in such partnership). References in this
Agreement (except as specifically otherwise defined) to "affiliates" shall
mean, as to any person, any other person which, directly or indirectly,
controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, such person.
As used in this definition, "control" (including, with its correlative
meanings, "controlled by" and "under common control with") shall mean the
possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of management or policies of a person, whether through the ownership
of securities or partnership or other ownership interests, by contract or
otherwise. References in this Agreement (except as specifically otherwise
defined) to "person" shall mean an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a
limited liability company, an association, a trust or any other entity, group
(as such term is used in Section 13 of the Exchange Act) or organization,
including, a Governmental Entity, and any permitted successors and assigns of
such person. As used in this Agreement, "knowledge" means (i) with respect to
Parent, the actual knowledge of the executive officers of Parent and (ii) with
respect to the Company, the actual knowledge of the individuals set forth in
Section 8.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. As used in this Agreement,
"business day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day on
which the banks in New York are authorized by law or executive order to be
closed. References in this Agreement to specific laws or to specific
provisions of laws shall include all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.
