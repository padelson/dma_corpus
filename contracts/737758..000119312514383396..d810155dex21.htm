assumptions and methodologies used in preparing the audited balance sheet of
the Seller as at December 31, 2013 that was previously delivered to Buyer and
such other assumptions and methodologies (including as to inventory valuation
and the establishment of general and specific reserves) described on
_Schedule 2.1_ attached hereto, is referred to herein as the " _Closing Net
Assets_ ". In the event of any conflict between _Schedule 2.1_ and this
_ARTICLE 2_,  _Schedule 2.1_ shall govern and control with respect to the
matters set forth therein. The Purchase Price will be payable as described in
the remaining provisions of this _Section 2.1_ and will be subject to
adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.3_.

(b) All of the Purchase Price will be payable in cash except for
$30,000,000 which will be paid by an unsecured promissory note issued by
Buyer to Seller at the Closing which note will provide for three principal
payments of $10,000,000 on each of the first, second and third anniversary
dates of the Closing and will bear simple interest at the rate of 4.0% per
annum and will be in form and substance substantially as set forth in _Exhibit
A_ (the " _Promissory Note_ "). All Purchased Assets other than goodwill shall
be sold in exchange for cash, and any remaining Purchase Price (including the
Promissory Note) not allocated to other Purchased Assets shall be applied to
goodwill. The Promissory Note will serve as the first, but not the exclusive,
source of funds to satisfy (i) any and all indemnification obligations of
Seller and the Seller Shareholders under this Agreement except for any
obligation of Seller under _Section 2.3(d)_, _Section 2.3(e)_ or _Section
8.11_ which shall be payable directly by Seller if applicable and (ii) any
liquidated damages to which Buyer is entitled under the Employment Agreement,
and will also be subject to offset as provided in Section 2.10(c) of the
Personnel Agreement.

 

(c) At the Closing, an amount of cash equal to (i) $197,300,000 _plus_ (ii)
the Estimated Net Assets will be paid to Seller (the " _Closing Cash
Consideration_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank
account designated in writing by Seller.

 



6 2.2 _Pre-Closing Inventory Count; Estimated Net Assets_.

 

(a) On or about November 1, 2014, Seller and Buyer will jointly conduct a
physical count of the serialized finished goods that are included in the
inventory of the Business. On or about one week before the anticipated Closing
Date, Buyer and Seller will jointly conduct a physical count of up to 200 SKUs
of High Value Components, or a subset thereof, and a random sample count of
cut steel that are included in the inventory of the Business. The results of
the foregoing inventory counts will be "rolled forward" to the Closing Date
and will be used, along with the information included in Sellers perpetual
inventory record keeping system for all other inventory items, to establish
the quantities of the items constituting the Inventory included in the
Purchased Assets solely for purposes of calculating the Estimated Net Assets.

 

(b) At least five Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Seller
will deliver to Buyer a certificate of Seller executed on its behalf by
Sellers chief financial officer that sets forth in reasonable detail Sellers
good faith estimate of the Closing Net Assets (the " _Estimated Net Assets_
"), along with supporting detail therefor, such estimate to be prepared in
accordance with (i) the assumptions and methodologies used in preparing the
audited balance sheet of the Seller as at December 31, 2013 that was
previously delivered to the Buyer, (ii) the principles of  _Section 2.1_ and
(iii) the provisions of _Schedule 2.1_.

2.3 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) Within 30 days after receipt by Buyer of the audited balance sheet of the
Business as of the Closing Date as contemplated in _Section 8.7_ or, if
Buyer waives in writing the requirement of Seller to deliver such a balance
sheet then within 90 days after the Closing, Buyer will deliver to Seller a
balance sheet of the Business as at the Closing Date setting forth thereon
Buyers calculation of Closing Net Assets (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ").
The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with (i) the
assumptions and methodologies used in preparing the audited balance sheet of
the Seller as at December 31, 2013 previously delivered to Buyer, and (ii) the
principles described in _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Schedule 2.1_. If an audited
balance sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date is delivered pursuant to
_Section 8.7_, the Closing Balance Sheet will be consistent with such audited
balance sheet except that the same shall be adjusted as necessary to reflect
the principles described in _Section 2.1(a)_ and  _Schedule 2.1_ thereto.
The Closing Balance Sheet will incorporate, without adjustment, the quantities
of the items of inventory as determined under _Section 2.2(a)_.

 

(b) Seller will have 30 days after its receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet to
notify Buyer in writing of any objections to the Closing Balance Sheet
(including Buyers calculation of Closing Net Assets), specifying in
reasonable detail the nature of and basis for each objection (a " _Balance
Sheet Objection Notice_ "). Seller (and Sellers accountants and other
representatives) will be given full access to all relevant books, records and
employees of Buyer (and of Buyers accountants and other representatives) to
the extent reasonably required to complete its review of the Closing
Balance Sheet. If Seller fails to timely deliver a Balance Sheet Objection
Notice, Seller will be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Closing
Balance Sheet (including Buyers calculation of Closing Net Assets) as
delivered by Buyer. If Seller timely delivers a Balance Sheet Objection

 



7  Notice, Seller and Buyer will, within 30 days following the date of such
notice (the " _Balance Sheet Resolution Period_ "), attempt in good faith to
resolve their differences, and any resolution between them as to disputed
items will be final, binding and conclusive on, and nonappealable by, the
parties hereto.

 

(c) If, at the conclusion of the Balance Sheet Resolution Period, Seller and
Buyer have not reached an agreement regarding Sellers objections, then all
issues set forth in the Balance Sheet Objection Notice remaining in dispute
may, at the election of either Seller or Buyer, be submitted for resolution to
Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP or such other Neutral Auditor as may be
appointed by mutual agreement of the parties in accordance herewith. Each
party agrees to execute, if requested by the Neutral Auditor, a reasonable
engagement letter. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to
be performed by the Neutral Auditor will be borne one-half by Seller and one-
half by Buyer. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all other costs
and expenses incurred by the parties in connection with resolving any dispute
before the Neutral Auditor will be borne by the party incurring such costs
and expenses. The Neutral Auditor will act as an arbitrator to determine,
based solely on the presentations by Seller and Buyer, and not by independent
review, only those issues still in dispute. The Neutral Auditors
determination (i) will be made within 30 days of its engagement (which
engagement will be made no later than three Business Days after an election by
either Seller or Buyer to submit the objections to the Neutral Auditor) or as
soon thereafter as possible; (ii) will be set forth in a written statement
delivered to Seller and Buyer; (iii) will be final, binding and conclusive on,
and nonappealable by, the parties hereto; and (iv) will be enforceable as a
judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The term " _Final Closing
Balance Sheet_ " means the definitive Closing Balance Sheet agreed (or deemed
agreed) upon between Seller and Buyer in accordance with  _Section 2.3(b)_
or the definitive Closing Balance Sheet resulting from the determination made
by the Neutral Auditor in accordance with this _Section 2.3(c)_ (in addition
to those items theretofore agreed to between Seller and Buyer).

(d) The Purchase Price will be (i) increased dollar for dollar to the extent
the Closing Net Assets as reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet are
greater than the Estimated Net Assets; or (ii) decreased dollar for dollar to
the extent the Closing Net Assets as reflected on the Final Closing Balance
Sheet are less than the Estimated Net Assets (any such increase or decrease
is referred to as the " _Adjustment Amount_ "). Buyer or Seller, as
applicable, will pay any Adjustment Amount in full, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified in writing by the
receiving party within five Business Days after the Final Closing Balance
Sheet is agreed (or deemed agreed) upon between Buyer and Seller or determined
by the Neutral Auditor.

 

(e) Buyer may elect, in its sole discretion, to conduct at any time prior to
April 30, 2015 a complete physical count of all inventory items of the
Business including cut steel but excluding the serialized finished goods and
High Value Components actually counted prior to Closing as contemplated in
_Section 2.2(a)_. If Buyer elects to do so such a count, it will notify
Seller in writing at least fourteen (14) days before the date on which the
physical count will begin and Seller and its representatives will be entitled
to be present to observe such counts. The physical counts will then be
compared to the

 



8  quantities for each item of inventory as indicated in the perpetual
inventory record keeping system of the Business as of the date of the physical
count and in the event that there are discrepancies between the physical
counts and the inventory record keeping system, the value of the items for
which there is a discrepancy (with the value being the cost for the item as it
would be calculated if counted on the Closing Date as determined in
accordance with the principles of _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Schedule 2.1_) will
be calculated, whether positive ( _i.e._ , the physical counts shows a higher
quantity than the inventory record keeping system) or lower ( _i.e._ , the
physical counts shows a lower quantity than the inventory record keeping
system) and the aggregate net value of all discrepancies will be determined
(the " _Physical Count Net Adjustment_ "). Buyer will send its calculation of
the Physical Count Net Adjustment to Seller and then Seller will have 15 days
after its receipt of Buyers calculation to notify Buyer in writing of any
objection thereto, specifying in reasonable detail the nature of and
basis for its objection (a " _Physical Count Objection Notice_ "). Seller
(and Sellers accountants and other representatives) will be given full access
to all books, records and employees relevant to the Physical Count Net
Adjustment of Buyer (and of Buyers accountants and other representatives) to
the extent reasonably required to complete its review of Buyers calculation
of the Physical Count Net Adjustment. If Seller fails to timely deliver a
Physical Count Objection Notice, Seller will be deemed to have accepted and
agreed to Buyers calculation of the Physical Count Net Adjustment. If Seller
timely delivers a Physical Count Objection Notice, Seller and Buyer will,
within 30 days following the date of such notice, attempt in good faith to
resolve their differences, and if they cannot resolve such difference then the
dispute will be submitted to the Neutral Auditor for resolution in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.3(c). After the Physical Count Net
Adjustment has been agreed to or established pursuant to the foregoing
provisions, 80% of the Physical Count Net Adjustment will be paid by Seller to
Buyer (if there is net negative discrepancy) or 80% of the Physical Count
Net Adjustment will be paid by Buyer to Seller (if there is net positive
discrepancy) within five Business Days; provided, however, that no payment
will be made under this _Section 2.3(e)_ in the event that the Physical Count
Net Adjustment is less than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000).

2.4 _Tax Allocation_.

 

(a) Within thirty (30) days after the Final Closing Balance Sheet is agreed
(or deemed agreed) upon between Buyer and Seller or determined by the Neutral
Auditor in accordance with _Section 2.3_, Buyer will provide Seller with
written notice of a proposed Purchase Price allocation for income tax
purposes. Seller may either accept Buyers proposed allocation and file Form
8594 checking the box that the parties have agreed to allocate the Purchase
Price consistent with such allocation or not accept Buyers proposed
allocation and use a different allocation in which case Buyer will reasonably
cooperate with Seller to allow Seller, if it so elects in its discretion, to
conduct its appraisal. Buyer acknowledges that Seller may elect to have its
own appraisal completed prior to receiving Buyers proposed allocation and
Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller and its appraiser in completing the
same. If Seller fails to inform Buyer in writing that it is not accepting
Buyers proposed allocation within thirty (30) days of receiving Buyers
proposed allocation, it will be deemed to have agreed to the allocation.

 



9 (b) If Buyer and Seller agree (or are deemed to agree) on an allocation of
the Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets under _Section 2.4(a)_, then
neither Buyer nor Seller will take any position (whether in financial
statements, audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) which is inconsistent with such
agreed upon allocation unless required to do so by applicable Law.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision in this _Section 2.4_ to the contrary, the
parties will allocate $500,000 of the Purchase Price to the non-competition
covenants provided in _Section 8.3_.

lease and operate its properties and assets. Seller is not qualified, licensed
or registered to do business as a foreign entity in any jurisdiction other
than as identified in _Schedule 4.1_ , nor does the nature of Sellers
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets require Seller
to be so qualified, licensed or registered except where the failure to be so
qualified, licensed or registered has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Seller has no Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliates (which means no

shares of voting common stock of Seller as of the designated record date (the
" _Required Shareholder Vote_ "). No other vote or action of the holders of
any class or series of capital stock of Seller or any other Person is required
by Law, Sellers Governing Documents or otherwise in order to approve this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by Seller. Seller obtained
the Required Shareholder Vote by and through the Written Consent, which was
executed by the sole holder of voting common stock of Seller and such Written
Consent constitutes the valid and binding required shareholder vote

Agreement (each, an " _Alternative Transaction_ "); (ii) provide written,
oral, audio, video or other form of information with respect to Seller or the
Business or any of the Purchased Assets to any Person, other than Buyer (and
its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and Affiliates),
relating to, or otherwise cooperate with, facilitate or encourage any effort
with regard to, or attempt by any such Person to pursue, an Alternative
Transaction; or (iii) enter into any direct or indirect, written or
oral agreement, or complete any transaction, with any Person providing for,
relating to or constituting an Alternative Transaction. Seller and the Seller
Shareholders will notify Buyer promptly if any proposals or other
communications regarding an Alternative Transaction are received by, or any
such information is requested from Seller, any Seller Shareholder or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and
Affiliates, or any such negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued,
regarding any Alternative Transaction, and the substantive terms and
conditions of any such proposal or other communications.

 

(b) Seller and the Seller Shareholders will ensure that their directors,
officers, employees, consultants, lenders, advisors, agents, representatives
and Affiliates are aware of the restrictions in this _Section 7.2_ as
reasonably necessary to avoid violations hereof. Any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.2_ by any such Persons (including
any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant, or other
retained advisor, agent or representative) of Seller or any Seller
Shareholder, or otherwise at the direction or with the consent or knowledge of
Seller or any Seller Shareholder, will be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 7.2_ by Seller (and any such Seller Shareholder, if applicable).

 

(c) Seller and each Seller Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that Buyer and
its Affiliates would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this _Section 7.2_ are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are Breached. Accordingly, Seller and each Seller
Shareholder agrees that Buyer and its Affiliates will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent Breaches of this _Section 7.2_ and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this _Section 7.2_ in any
action instituted in any court having jurisdiction over the parties and the
matter, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law
or in equity.

7.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The obligations of this
_Section 7.3_ shall only apply during the Pre-Closing Period.

(a) Subject to applicable Law, Seller will:

(i) afford to Buyer and its representatives reasonable physical and
electronic access (including for the purpose of coordinating integration
activities and transition planning), during regular business hours upon
reasonable notice, to the employees, plants, offices, warehouses and other
facilities of the Business and 

 



39  to all books, Contracts (subject to applicable confidentiality
restrictions), commitments and records of the Business (including Tax Returns

request Sellers independent public accountants to provide access to and
copies of their work papers and such other information as Buyer may reasonably
request;

 

(ii) upon reasonable notice, permit Buyer and its representatives to make such
inspections as it may reasonably require; and 

(iii) cause Sellers officers to furnish Buyer and its representatives with
such financial and operating data and other information with respect to the
business, properties and personnel of the Business in such format and detail
as Buyer may from time to time reasonably request.

 

(b) All requests by Buyer and its representatives for information and access
hereunder will be coordinated through either of the Seller Shareholders or a
designee of such person. All information acquired by Buyer or any of its
representatives under this _Section 7.3_ will be subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation or information
provided under this _Section 7.3_ will affect any representation or warranty
in this Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of
the parties hereto.

 

7.4 _Reasonable Efforts; Notification_. The obligations of this _Section 7.4_
shall only apply during the Pre-Closing Period. 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties will use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to complete and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
use of all commercially reasonable efforts to:

 

(i) cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as
practicable;

 

(ii) obtain all necessary Consents from, and submit all necessary notices,
registrations and filings with, Authorities and other Third Parties;

(iii) defend against any Proceedings or other actions by Authorities or other
Third Parties challenging this Agreement or the completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including seeking to have vacated or
reversed any Order issued by an Authority); and

 

(iv) execute and deliver such additional instruments as may be necessary to
complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) At or prior to the Closing, Seller will update the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (but not any other schedules other than _Schedule 1.1(c)_ as
mutually agreed

 



40  upon by Seller and Buyer and _Schedule 12.14_ as provided in _Section
7.5(h)_ ) to reflect events or circumstances, whether arising before or after
the date of this Agreement, if such update is necessary so that the
representations and warranties set forth in _ARTICLE 4_ and _ARTICLE 5_ are
true and correct but no such supplement will be deemed to modify the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or otherwise qualify any of the representations and
warranties set forth in _ARTICLE 4_ and _ARTICLE 5_ for purposes of
determining the accuracy of such representations for any purposes of this
Agreement, including without limitation _Section 9.1(b)_,  _Section
11.3(a)(i)_ and _Section 11.3(b)(i)_. For purposes of clarity, no supplements
or updates made to the Seller Disclosure Schedule after the date hereof will
operate to waive any right of any Buyer Indemnified Party to indemnification
under _Section 11.3(a)(i)_ or _Section 11.3(b)(i)_.

7.5 _Real Property_.

 

(a) Buyer has received an ALTA/ACSM survey of the Owned Real Property (the "
_Survey_ ") prepared by a Michigan registered surveyor.

(b) Seller has caused or will cause First American Title Insurance Company
(the " _Title Insurer_ ") to furnish to Buyer and Seller with a commitment ("
_Commitment_ ") regarding each Owned Real Property for an ALTA 2006 Owners
Policy of Title Insurance in an amount reasonably acceptable to Buyer and
Seller (but in any event no less than the current assessed value for the land
and improvements on each Owned Real Property on the Closing Date). The
Commitment, the Schedule B documents and the Survey, if any, shall
collectively be referred to as the " _Title Evidence_ ".

(c) On or before the Closing, Seller will cause Title Insurer to furnish to
Buyer an owners title insurance policy (" _Title Policy_ ") issued by Title
Insurer pursuant to the Commitment, or a suitably marked up Commitment
initialed by the Title Insurer undertaking to issue a Title Policy within a
reasonable time in the form required by the Commitment, as reasonably
approved by Buyer.

(d) Seller will pay the costs of the Commitment, the related title searches
and a GAP endorsement. Buyer will pay the premium for the Title Policy and the
cost of any other endorsements Buyer desires. Seller and Buyer will each pay
one half of any reasonable and customary closing fee or charge imposed by the
Title Insurer or its designated closing agent. Buyer will pay all costs
related to or arising from the Survey. Seller will pay all state and local
transfer tax due on the deed to be delivered by Seller under this Agreement.
Seller will pay recording fees for instruments necessary to cure any
objections to the matters disclosed in the Title Evidence which can be cured
solely by the payment of a fixed sum of money including, without limitation,
payment of any mortgages, judgments, or monetary liens (the "Payment
Objections") and such payments shall be paid at Closing by Seller from the
Closing proceeds. Buyer will pay recording fees for each deed and any other
documents desired by Buyer or its lender. 

(e) The other provisions of this Agreement notwithstanding, Seller will pay
all general real estate taxes and installments of special assessments,
including any interest and penalties, with respect to the Owned Real Estate
that are due and payable in all years prior to the year in which the Closing
occurs. Seller and Buyer will prorate the general 

 



41  real estate taxes and installments of special assessments with respect to
the Owned Real Estate due and payable in the year of Closing as of the Closing
Date based upon the calendar year, without duplication of any accrual or
refund included in the Final Closing Balance Sheet. Such proration shall be
based on the number of days in such year on or before the Closing Date and the
number of days in such year after the Closing Date. Seller shall receive a
credit at Closing for any real estate taxes and assessments previously paid by
Seller with respect to the prorated period after the Closing Date. Buyer will
pay all general real estate taxes and installments of special
assessments, including interest, due and payable with respect to the Owned
Real Estate for the prorated period after the Closing Date.

 

(f) Seller and Seller Shareholders acknowledge that Buyer has not completed
its due diligence with respect to the Title Evidence, and accordingly a
closing condition in favor of Buyer has been set forth in _Section 9.2(e)_.

(g) Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any
objections to matters disclosed in the Title Evidence raised by Buyer.

 

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller and Buyer agree that prior to Closing,  _Schedule 12.14_ will be
prepared to contain only those items that Title Insurer and Buyer have agreed
will be shown as title exceptions on the Title Policy. In furtherance thereof,
the parties agree that the pro-forma title policy issued by Title Insurer and
agreed to by Buyer shall be the basis for the items to be set forth on
_Schedule 12.14_.

7.6 _Employees_. 

(a) Buyer shall offer employment to Business Employees pursuant to the terms
set forth in the Personnel Agreement and as of the Buyer Employment Start
Date (as defined in the Personnel Agreement); _provided_ , that Buyer shall
offer to employ David J. Brule II effective immediately following Closing in
accordance with the terms of the Employment Agreement.

 

(b) Seller shall be responsible for providing and/or discharging any and all
notifications, benefits, and liabilities for pre-Closing and pre-Buyer
Employment Start Date notifications, benefits and liabilities to Business
Employees, collective bargaining representatives of Sellers employees, and
governmental entities required by Law.

 

(c) With respect to any Seller Plan that is a 401(k) plan in which the
Business Employees participate as of the day immediately prior to the Buyer
Employment Start Date, Seller shall take or cause to be taken all necessary
action to vest such employees in their respective account balances and to make
all matching contributions, profit sharing and true-up contributions
in respect of periods prior to the Buyer Employment Start Date in accordance
with Sellers past practices and the terms of the Plan (and with respect to
IBEW Business Employees, pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining
agreement). Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in implementing such
administrative procedures as may be reasonably necessary to permit Hired
Business Employees to take distributions of such balances as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Buyer Employment Start Date and, at
their option, to make direct rollovers of such distributions (including direct
rollovers of outstanding loans and any promissory notes evidencing such loans,
but excluding direct rollovers of other in-kind distributions and Roth
account distributions) to a 401(k) plan sponsored and maintained by Buyer or
its Affiliates from and after the Buyer Employment Start Date.

 



42 (d) Beginning on the date hereof, Buyer will engage in good faith
discussions with the IBEW Union regarding the terms and conditions of Buyers
employment of the IBEW Business Employees beginning on the Buyer Employment
Start Date.

 

(e) Seller and Buyer will cooperate in good faith with the trustees of the
IBEW-LU2221 Health and Welfare Trust to transfer an equitable portion of the
assets of such trust (on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Buyer
Employment Start Date) to a new IBEW Union health and welfare plan trust
established for IBEW Business Employees who become Hired Business Employees.

7.7 _No Plan Amendment or Third Party Rights_. Nothing herein expressed or
implied shall confer upon any employee, former employee, leased employee,
independent contractor or consultant of Seller any rights or remedies,
including right to employment or continued employment with Seller or Buyer for
any specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement, the Transition
Services Agreement or the Personnel Agreement. Nothing in _Section 7.6_ will
be deemed to amend any Plan or employee benefit plan of Buyer. No person,
including any employee (or dependent thereof) of Seller, is a third
party beneficiary of any term of _Section 7.6_, the Transition Services
Agreement or the Personnel Agreement.

(a) Except as otherwise agreed in writing between Buyer and Seller, as
required by Law or as expressly permitted by the communications plan
described in _Section 8.1(b)_, none of Seller or any Seller Shareholder, nor
any of their respective Affiliates, will make any public announcement
(including any general announcement to employees, customers, suppliers or
others having dealings with Seller), postings to any public website or
electronic forum, or similar communication regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer will be free to make any public
announcement or similar communication that Buyer deems appropriate or
advisable in which case Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to
advise Seller and the Seller Shareholders prior to making such announcement or
communication; provided, however, that if Buyer includes in any such
announcement or communication a statement attributable to a Seller
Shareholder, Buyer will, prior to making such announcement or communication,
provide a draft of the same to the applicable Seller Shareholder at least
two (2) Business Days in advance and incorporate any reasonable comments from
such Seller Shareholder with respect to such statement. Seller and the Seller
Shareholders understand and acknowledge that Buyer will be required to file a
Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC to disclose the acquisition
contemplated by this Agreement and Seller and the Seller Shareholders
expressly consent to such timely filing.

 

(b) Seller and Buyer will consult with one another regarding the
communications plan (including content and medium) by which Business
Employees, customers, suppliers and others having business dealings with the
Business will be informed of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and all communications in such communications plan that are to be conducted
jointly will be conducted jointly by Seller and Buyer.

 



43 8.2 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Confidential Information_ "
means (i) all information, books and records of Buyer, including customer,
supplier and prospect information, Intellectual Property, sales, marketing,
employment, financial and accounting information, and quality control and
regulatory information, which Seller, any Seller Shareholder or any of their
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and Affiliates is
provided or learns in connection with or as a result of the negotiation,
preparation or performance of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (" _Buyer Information_ "); (ii) all Intellectual Property included in
the Purchased Assets and all tangible and electronic embodiments of the
Intellectual Property; and (iii) all Business Information and other books and
records of Seller that constitute Purchased Assets, excluding in each case any
such information that at any time is or becomes lawfully available to the
general public through no fault of Seller or a Seller
Shareholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Confidential Information" shall
not include any information which (a) is or becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of breach of this _Section 8.2_ by Seller or
any Seller Shareholder, (b) is received by Seller or any Seller Shareholder
from a Third Party who is not bound by any confidentiality obligation to
Seller or Buyer with respect to the same, or (c) is required for Seller to
operate the Systems Control division in the Ordinary Course of Business,
provided that such information is solely used for such purpose.

(b) Except as required by the terms of a valid and binding Order issued by a
competent Authority or applicable Law (including Tax obligations), Seller and
each Seller Shareholder will and will cause their directors, officers,
employees, agents, representatives and Affiliates to keep confidential and
protect, and to not disclose, allow access to or use in any way (other than in
connection with the performance of their obligations or exercise of their
rights hereunder and/or under any Ancillary Documents), any Buyer Information
and, from and after the Closing, all other Confidential Information. Seller
and each Seller Shareholder acknowledge and agree that the Buyer Information
is and will continue to be and, from and after the Closing, all other
Confidential Information will be, the exclusive property of Buyer and its
Affiliates. Promptly following Closing, Seller and each Seller Shareholder
will deliver to Buyer or destroy, at Buyers request and option, all tangible
and electronic embodiments (including all copies) of the Buyer Information
that are in the possession or control of Seller or such Seller Shareholder, or
any of their directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and
Affiliates, without retaining any copies thereof, except that one archive
copy may be retained on a strictly confidential basis by Sellers outside
counsel, as custodian, to the extent required to comply with Sellers legal
obligations subject to providing written notice to Buyer describing in
reasonable detail the nature and scope of the records so retained and the
contact information of such custodian.

 

(c) The covenants and undertakings contained in this _Section 8.2_ relate to
matters which may be of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of

 



44  any of the terms of this _Section 8.2_ may cause irreparable injury to
Buyer and its Affiliates, the amount of which may be impossible to estimate or
determine and for which adequate compensation may not be available.
Therefore, Buyer and its Affiliates will be entitled to an injunction,
restraining order or other equitable relief from a court of competent
jurisdiction restraining any violation or threatened violation of any such
terms by Seller or any Seller Shareholder or any of their directors, officers,
employees, agents, representatives or Affiliates.

 

(d) If Seller or any Seller Shareholder receives a request to disclose all or
any part of the Confidential Information in connection with a Proceeding,
Seller or that Seller Shareholder (as applicable) will, to the extent
permitted by Law, (i) promptly notify Buyer of the existence, terms and
circumstances surrounding such request, (ii) consult with Buyer regarding the
advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such
request, and (iii) if disclosure of such information is required, disclose the
minimum required and exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain,
at Buyers expense, an Order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such portion of the disclosed information which
Buyer so designates.

 

(e) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, Seller and the Seller
Shareholders will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Persons
(other than Buyer and its Affiliates) who have been furnished with any
Confidential Information or other confidential information regarding the
Business and Purchased Assets in connection with the solicitation of,
or discussions regarding, an Alternative Transaction prior to the date hereof
(other than information provided to any Authority or to a Third Party pursuant
to an Assigned Contract) promptly to return or destroy such information to the
extent that the applicable confidentiality agreements or similar provisions
allow Seller or the Seller Shareholder to require such return or destruction.
Neither Seller nor any Seller Shareholder will release any Person from the
confidentiality provisions of any Contract to which Seller or a Seller
Shareholder is or becomes a party or under which it is a beneficiary, relating
to any Alternative Transaction or that otherwise protects or relates to any
Confidential Information.

 

(f) Seller and the Seller Shareholders will ensure that their directors,
officers, employees, consultants, lenders, advisors, agents, representatives
and Affiliates are aware of the restrictions in this _Section 8.2_ as
reasonably necessary to avoid violations hereof. Any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 8.2_ by any such Persons (including
any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant, or other
retained advisor, agent or representative) of Seller or any Seller
Shareholder, or otherwise at the direction or with the consent of Seller or
any Seller Shareholder, will be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 8.2_
by Seller (and any such Seller Shareholder, if applicable).

 

8.3 _Noncompetition; Nonsolicitation_. As a further material portion of the
consideration to be received by Buyer for entering into this Agreement,
Seller and each Major Shareholder agree as follows:

(a) Neither Seller nor either Major Shareholder will, during the Restricted
Period, directly or indirectly, engage or have an interest, anywhere in the
United States,

 



45  Canada, China, England, Germany, Japan, New Zealand or any other country in
or to which Seller sells or markets products or services in the conduct of the
Business, either alone or in association with others, whether as principal,
officer, advisor, agent, employee, director, partner or stockholder, or
through the investment of capital, lending of money or property, rendering of
contract manufacturing or other services or otherwise, in or to any business
that develops, manufactures, markets, distributes or sells snow and ice
management products (other than acquiring an aggregate of not more than 2% of
the outstanding shares of any company with a class of securities listed for
trading on a national securities exchange, provided that Seller, either alone
or in combination with any other Person or Persons, does not have or attempt
to acquire control of such company). Further, neither Seller nor either Major
Shareholder will at any time, directly or indirectly, use or authorize any
Person to use any Mark or other identifying words or images which are the same
as or substantially similar to any of those which are included in the
Purchased Assets, whether or not the use would be in a business in which each
such Person is prohibited from engaging pursuant to this _Section 8.3(a)_.

(b) Neither Buyer, Seller nor either Major Shareholder will, during the
Restricted Period, directly or indirectly, on its own behalf or on behalf of
any other Person, hire, recruit or otherwise solicit or induce any employee of
the other party to terminate his or her employment or other relationship with
Seller, Buyer or any of their Affiliates, as applicable, except that the
provisions of this _Section 8.3(b)_ will not apply with respect to (i) a
Person whose employment has been terminated or who terminates his or her own
employment without direct or indirect solicitation or inducement by Buyer,
Seller or either Major Shareholder, as applicable; (ii) solicitations made in
public advertisements or through employment search firms (so long as neither
Buyer, Seller nor either Major Shareholder, as applicable, directly or
indirectly instructs the search firm to contact employees of such business)
and hires in connection with such general solicitations; and (iii) hiring any
Person who contacts Buyer, Seller or either Major Shareholder, as applicable,
entirely on his or her own initiative.

 

(c) Buyer, Seller and each Major Shareholder acknowledge and agree that the
restrictions imposed by this  _Section 8.3_ are material conditions to the
willingness of the parties hereto to enter into this Agreement and agree that
such restrictions are reasonable (including with respect to duration,
geographical area and scope) and necessary to protect the legitimate
interests of each party and its respective Affiliates (including the
preservation of the Purchased Assets). Nevertheless, if, at the time of
enforcement of this _Section 8.3_, a court holds that the duration, scope or
area restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then
existing, the parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or area
reasonable under such circumstances will be substituted for the stated
duration, scope or area. In addition, Buyer, Seller and each Major
Shareholder acknowledge and agree that each party and its Affiliates would be
damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this _Section 8.3_
are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are
Breached. Accordingly, each party agrees that the other party and its
Affiliates will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
Breaches of this _Section 8.3_ and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this _Section 8.3_ in any action instituted in any court having
jurisdiction over the parties and the matter, in addition to any other remedy
to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity.

 



46 8.4 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Seller and Buyer will each pay, and be responsible for, 50% of any
sales Tax, use Tax, transfer Tax (including any real estate transfer or
similar tax on transfer of the Owned Real Property), documentary stamp Tax,
value added Tax or similar Taxes and related fees (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
imposed on the sale or transfer of the Purchased Assets pursuant to this
Agreement or the entering into of this Agreement. Seller will prepare and file
all Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes, subject to Buyers right
to review and approve the same, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

8.5 _Payment of Retained Liabilities; Collection of Accounts Receivable_.

 

(a) Seller will pay or make adequate provision for the payment in full of all
of the Retained Liabilities.

 

(b) On the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, but in any event
not more than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer
shall jointly notify customers and other account debtors of the Business that
the Business has been acquired by Buyer. Such notice shall include
notification that payment of all accounts receivable with respect to the
Business after the Closing (whether the receivable arose before, on or after
the Closing) shall be payable to Seller until January 1, 2015, at which time
payment for all such receivables will be transferred to Buyer. Amounts
received by Seller for payment of any accounts receivable arising from
operation of the Business after the Closing (" _Buyer Receivables_ "), whether
received before, on or after January 1, 2015, shall be for the account of and
held in trust for Buyer and transferred to Buyer in the manner hereinafter
described. Amounts received by Buyer for payment of any Accounts Receivable,
whether received before, on or after January 1, 2015, shall be for the account
of and held in trust for Seller and promptly (and in any event, within five
Business Days of receipt) transferred to Seller along with such information
related to the payment as Seller may reasonably request. If Seller receives
payment of Accounts Receivable after the Closing, Seller shall retain the
payment as a Retained Asset but will on a periodic basis provide a written
update of such payments to Buyer. Seller will use commercially reasonable
efforts, consistent with past practices of the Business prior to the Closing,
to collect all Accounts Receivable. On or about the eighth (8th) day after the
Closing, and weekly thereafter until the earlier of the full collection of all
Accounts Receivable and January 1, 2015, Seller will transfer to Buyer all
payments received on Buyer Receivables during the prior seven (7) day period
with a report reasonably identifying the payment received.

 

(c) Payments received from a customer or other account debtor of the Business
after the Closing will be presumed to apply first to the longest outstanding
accounts receivable from that payor and then to the most recent accounts
receivable from that payor, and so on, until all Accounts Receivable from that
payor have been paid in full to Seller; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i)
any use of credits and discounts by a customer that are identifiable to a
specific invoice will be used against that invoice and (ii) any payment that
is indicated by a customer to be for a specific invoice will be applied to
that invoice.

 



47 (d) If Seller reclaims any inventory in which it has a priority security
interest under the Collateral Subordination Agreement from any delinquent
customer or other account debtor of the Business, whether through foreclosure
on Sellers priority security interest in such inventory or otherwise, and
such inventory is useable and saleable in the ordinary course of business
either "as is" or with reasonable refurbishment, Buyer will purchase such
inventory from Seller at a purchase price equal to the standard cost of Seller
as of the Closing of such inventory. In no event may Seller take any action,
whether with respect to any reclaimed inventory or otherwise, that would
constitute a breach of the covenants set forth in _Section 8.3_.

 

(e) If Buyer, its employees or representatives, or a Business Employee, at the
request of Seller, initiates a sale or other transfer of any inventory from
any customer of the Business owing delinquent Accounts Receivable to Seller to
another customer of the Business, then Seller will pay to Buyer an amount
equal to 10% of the amount collected by Seller from the selling customer on
the applicable Accounts Receivable following such sale or other transfer.

(f) Notwithstanding any contrary term above, if after April 1, 2015, Buyer
sells inventory to any customer of the Business whom Buyer knows has
delinquent Accounts Receivable owed to Seller, then any payment from such
delinquent customer received by Buyer after such a sale will apply first to
the longest outstanding Accounts Receivable from that customer. Seller will
deliver a list of such delinquent customers to Buyer no later than March 31,
2015.

 

(g) Seller may after written notice to Buyer initiate Third Party collection
proceedings to the extent consistent with Sellers past practices, provided
that Seller considers in good faith any reasonable proposal by Buyer with
respect to the method of such collection efforts.

 

(h) The Seller Shareholders will cause Seller to comply with the provisions of
this _Section 8.5_.

 

8.6 _Retention of and Access to Records_. From and after the Closing Date:

 

(a) Seller will retain and provide Buyer and its representatives with
reasonable access to and copies of all books and records that constitute
Retained Assets, during normal business hours and upon reasonable written
notice, for any reasonable business purposes specified by Buyer in such
notice.

 

(b) Buyer will retain all books and records that constitute Purchased Assets
for a period consistent with the retention period assigned in Buyers
"Records Classification and Retention" policy as in effect on the date hereof,
a correct and complete copy of which has been provided to Seller. Solely for
purposes of determining the retention period within such policy for the
Business books and records, such books and records will be retained within
such policy as if they had been created by or for the

 



48  benefit of Buyer and its Affiliates. Following the expiration of such
period, Buyer may dispose of such books and records; provided that, if
requested by Seller prior to the expiration of the applicable retention
period, or if requested by Seller after the expiration of the applicable
retention period if Buyer is still in the possession or control of the
applicable books and records at such time, Buyer shall deliver to Seller,
at Sellers expense, any of such books and records as Seller may request in
order to enable Seller to prepare Tax Returns or respond to Tax audits, defend
or prosecute any Proceeding involving a Third Party, in connection with
accounting or financial reporting requirements applicable to Seller, in order
to fulfill Sellers or any Sellers Shareholders obligations under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document, or for any other reasonable business
purpose that does not have an adverse impact on Buyer (and specifically
excluding in connection with any enforcement by Seller or any Seller
Shareholder of its rights against Buyer or any of its Affiliates under this
Agreement).

 

8.7 _Preparation of Financial Statements_. Seller and the Seller Shareholders
acknowledge that Buyer is a public company listed on the New York Stock
Exchange and, as such, has certain financial reporting obligations under
applicable Law and/or stock exchange requirements, which may require Buyer to
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") on a Current
Report on Form 8-K certain audited and unaudited financial statements and
related footnotes for the Business for certain periods and pro forma financial
statements giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, all of
which must be prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. In order
that Buyer may comply with such obligations, Seller shall, at Sellers sole
cost and expense, prepare and deliver to Buyer no later than 60 days after
the Closing, an audited consolidated balance sheet of the Business as at the
Closing Date and the related audited consolidated statements of income,
statement of cash flows and changes in stockholders equity of the Business
for period from January 1, 2014 through the Closing Date, in each case with
all applicable footnotes, and including a report from Sellers independent
auditor containing an unqualified opinion that such financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Business and the results of operations in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied (the " _Required Post-Closing Financial Statements_ "). Seller shall
use its best efforts to assist with obtaining all the consents required from

Owned Real Property, whether caused by accident, fire, flood, excessive snow
fall, tornado, the exercise by any Person of rights to mine iron ore and any
other minerals or fossils, in, under or upon the Owned Real Property, or
otherwise, that causes a material disruption to the operations or
profitability of the Business for more than a temporary period of time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such covenant shall be of no further force and
effect if either (i) no agreement is reached by December 31, 2014 to the
mutual satisfaction of Buyer, Seller and the trustees of the IBEW-LU2221

assets of such trust (on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Buyer

contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, Seller will provide Buyer with
reasonable physical and electronic access to its premises and computers (and
will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any Third Parties who
possess or control any of the Purchased Assets to provide Buyer with
reasonable physical and electronic access to their premises and computers),

request, in order to collect, package and otherwise prepare for delivery to
Buyer all Purchased Assets that are in tangible or electronic form.

items. Within fourteen (14) days of receiving the written notice, Seller will
have the right to inspect and count the unsold items set forth on such
schedule.

provisions of any bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Laws of any
jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any
or all of the Purchased Assets to Buyer.

efforts to cooperate with and assist Buyer in obtaining the benefits, to the

abandoned, at any time prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

 

(b) by either Buyer or Seller, upon written notice to the other, if:

 

(i) the Closing has not occurred on or before December 31, 2014 (the "
_Termination Date_ "), except that (A) this termination right may not be

Breach has prevented the Closing from being completed on or before such date
and (B) Buyer or Seller by written notice to the other on or before the
above-stated Termination Date may extend the Termination Date up to 30
calendar days in the event that all conditions to Closing other than that set
forth in _Section 9.1(c)_ have been or are 

 



52  capable of being satisfied at the time of such extension and the electing
party believes in good faith the condition in _Section 9.1(c)_ is reasonably
capable of being satisfied on or prior to such extended Termination Date; or

(ii) a Legal Restraint having the effect set forth in  _Section 9.1(b)_ is

(c) by Buyer, upon written notice to Seller, if Seller or any Seller
Shareholder is in Breach of this Agreement, the Breach would result in the
failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in _Sections 9.1_
or _9.2_ , and in any such case, the Breach is incapable of being cured or,
if capable of being cured, has not been cured within 30 days after written

stated therein) has been delivered to Seller; or

 

(d) by Seller, upon written notice to Buyer, if Buyer is in Breach of this

to Buyer.

10.2 _Obligations Upon Termination_. The right of termination under _Section
10.1_ is in addition to any other rights that Buyer, Seller or a Seller
Shareholder may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of a
right of termination will not constitute an election of remedies and will not
preclude an action for damages resulting from a Breach of this Agreement. If
this Agreement is terminated, all continuing obligations of the parties under
this Agreement will terminate, except that the second sentence of _Section
7.3(b)_ (Access to Information; Confidentiality), _Section 8.2_

representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document will survive the Closing and the completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The indemnification rights and

regardless of when suffered or incurred and whether or not involving a claim

(a) any Breach of a representation or warranty by Buyer in this Agreement or

Agreement;

(c) the Assumed Liabilities (regardless of whether there has been any Breach
or whether the Losses are recoverable under any other provision of this
_Section 11.2_), except to the extent such matter, or the same or
substantially similar facts and circumstances giving rise to such
indemnification claim under this _Section 11.2(c)_, also gives rise to a
claim for indemnification by a Buyer Indemnified Party under _Section 11.3_;

 

(d) any and all Taxes arising out of the Business or ownership or use of the

ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets or the operation of the
Business after the Closing (regardless of whether there has been any Breach or
whether the Losses are recoverable under any other provision of this _Section
11.2_), except (i) to the extent such matter, or the same or substantially
similar facts and circumstances giving rise to such indemnification claim
under this _Section 11.2(e)_, also gives rise to a claim for indemnification
by a Buyer Indemnified Party under _Section 11.3_ or (ii) for such matters
for which Seller is responsible under the Transition Services Agreement or
Personnel Agreement; or

 

(f) any and all reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees
and expenses, in connection with enforcing the indemnification rights of the
Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Section 11.2_, in each case to
the extent that such enforcement is successful.

 

11.3 _Indemnification of Buyer Indemnified Parties_.

 

(a) Subject to the applicable provisions of _Section 11.4_, Seller and the
Seller Shareholders will jointly and severally indemnify in full Buyer and
each of Buyers Affiliates, together with their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified
Parties_ "), and hold them harmless from and against, any and all Losses
which they or any of them may suffer or incur, directly or indirectly,
regardless of when suffered or incurred and whether or not involving a claim
by a Third Party, which arise from or relate to:

 

(i) any Breach of a representation or warranty by Seller or any Seller
Shareholder under _ARTICLE 4_ of this Agreement or in any Ancillary Document,
determined in each case (except for the representations and warranties set
forth in ( _Section 4.7(b)_, clause (B) of _Section 4.17(a)_, _Section

indemnification claim may be made by a Buyer Indemnified Party under this
_Section 11.3(a)(ii)_ as a result of a breach of a covenant in _Section
7.1(a)_ or _Section 7.1(b)_, and/or _Section 11.3(a)(i)_ as a result of a
breach of a warranty and representation in _ARTICLE 4_ , in either case
resulting from the same events or circumstances, then the applicable Buyer
Indemnified Party shall not seek recourse for such matter under this _Section
11.3(a)(ii)_;

(iii) the Retained Liabilities (regardless of whether there has been any
Breach or whether the Losses are recoverable under any other provision of this
_Section 11.3_);

 

(iv) all Liabilities otherwise arising from or relating to Sellers use,
ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets or the operation of the
Business prior to the Closing (regardless of whether there has been any Breach
or whether the Losses are recoverable under any other provision of this
_Section 11.3_);

 

(v) all Liabilities arising from or relating to any transactions involving any
capital stock or other equity of Seller, whether occurring among current or
former shareholders of Seller;

(vi) the matters set forth on _Schedule 11.3_ ; or

case to the extent that such enforcement is successful.

 

(b) Subject to the applicable provisions of _Section 11.4_, each Seller
Shareholder will severally, but not jointly, indemnify in full the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, and hold them harmless from and against, any and all
Losses which they or any of them may suffer or incur, directly or indirectly,
regardless of when suffered or incurred and whether or not involving a claim
by a Third Party, which arise from or relate to:

(i) any Breach of a representation or warranty by that Seller Shareholder
under _ARTICLE 5_ of this Agreement or in any Ancillary Document, determined
in each case without giving effect to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect
or material adverse effect qualifiers therein;

 



55 (ii) any Breach of a covenant, agreement or undertaking by that
Seller Shareholder in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
indemnification claim may be made by a Buyer Indemnified Party under this
_Section 11.3(b)(ii)_ as a result of a breach of a covenant in _Section
7.1(a)_ or _Section 7.1(b)_, and/or _Section 11.3(a)(ii)_ as a result of a
breach of a warranty and representation in _ARTICLE 5_ , in either case

Indemnified Party shall not seek recourse for such matter under this _Section
11.3(b)(ii)_; or

(iii) any and all costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and
expenses, incurred in connection with enforcing the indemnification rights of

case to the extent that such enforcement is successful.

(c) Seller and Seller Shareholders acknowledge that Buyer has certain rights
to liquidated damages under Section 9(f) of the Employment Agreement and that
the payment of such liquidated damages if required under the terms of Section
9(f) of the Employment Agreement shall be made by Seller. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is understood that Sellers
obligation to pay liquidated damages shall not be subject to the Basket but
shall in all other respects be subject to the other provisions of this
_Article 11_.

 

(d) Seller and Seller Shareholders acknowledge that Buyer has certain rights
to payments under Section 2.10(c) of the Personnel Agreement including that
such payments shall be made by Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, it is understood that Sellers obligation to make
the payments referred to in the preceding sentence shall not be subject to
the Basket but shall in all other respects be subject to the other provision
of this _Article 11_.

11.4  _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) After the Closing, notwithstanding any contrary term herein (i) the
Buyer Indemnified Parties may not recover any Losses under _Section
11.3(a)(i)_ until the total of all Losses with respect to those matters
collectively exceed Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000) (the "
_Basket_ "), in which case, subject to any other applicable limitations
contained in this _Section 11.4_, the Buyer Indemnified Parties will be
entitled to recover all Losses in excess of the Basket; and (ii) (1) the Buyer
Indemnified Parties may not recover any Losses under _Section 11.3(a)(i)_ to
the extent that the Losses with respect to those matters collectively exceed
Thirty Million Dollars ($30,0000,000) and (2) the Buyer Indemnified Parties
may not recover any Losses under _Section 11.3_ to the extent all Losses
with respect to those matters collectively exceed the Purchase Price (the "
_Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Basket nor the Cap will
apply with respect to any Breach of the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 4.1_ (Organization, Standing and Corporate Power),
_Section 4.2_ (Capitalization), _Section 4.3_ (Authority; Approvals), the
last sentence of  _Section 4.8(a)_ or the first sentence of _Section 4.9_
(Title), _Section 4.10_ (Inventory), _Section 4.14_ (Tax Matters) or
_Section 4.28_ (Brokers) or to any claims based on fraud, knowing and
intentional misconduct or willful misconduct, and the Losses associated with
any such Breaches will not count toward the Basket or Cap for determining the
recoverability of other Losses.

 

(b) Subject to the foregoing limitations, the amount of any Losses to which a
Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under _Section 11.3_
will be recovered in the following manner, (i) first, to the extent of any
outstanding unpaid principal balance owed under the Promissory Note by offset
against such balance of the 

 



56  amount of such Losses, plus interest accrued on the amount of such Losses at
the interest rate applicable under the Promissory Note from the date of the
Promissory Note until the date of such offset or other recovery, following
written notice of offset from Buyer to Seller, and (ii) second, to the extent
the Losses and such interest exceed the amounts available to offset under the
Promissory Note, by payment directly from Seller and/or the Seller
Shareholders (with full recourse against each of them and all of their
assets). If Seller or any Seller Shareholder becomes obligated to indemnify a
Buyer Indemnified Party directly, such indemnification obligations shall be
paid within five Business Days of Seller or such Seller Shareholder agreeing
such indemnification obligation is payable or the Buyer Indemnified Party
receives a judgment in its favor with respect to the applicable claim. Any
exercise of such right of offset under the Promissory Note in good faith,
whether or not ultimately determined to be justified, will not constitute a
breach of this Agreement or the Promissory Note, provided that if ultimately
determined that any amount of principal of such offset was not justified,
then (x) any default interest rate provided under the Promissory Note will be
deemed to have been accruing on the account of such principal (in addition to
the base interest rate) during the period from the initial offset until paid
in full and (y) Seller shall have the right to recover any out-of-pocket
costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, arising in connection with such
offset.

 

(c) The following claims limitations periods will apply, but, for clarity, in
each case Losses relating to any claim will be recoverable whenever they are
incurred provided notice of the claim is given within the required claims
period and the applicable representation will continue to survive for purposes
of indemnification for the matter set forth in any claim that is given within
the required claims period:

(i) Claims for indemnification under _Sections 11.2(a)_ , _11.3(a)(i)_  or
_11.3(b)(i)_ must be made no later than the 18 month anniversary of the
Closing Date, except that claims arising from any Breach of the
representations and warranties contained in (1) _Section 4.1_ (Organization,
Standing and Corporate Power), _Section 4.2_ (Capitalization), _Section
4.3_ (Authority; Approvals), _Section 4.13_ (Compliance with Laws; Permits;
Regulatory Matters), _Section 4.14_ (Tax Matters), _Section
5.1_ (Organization, Standing and Corporate Power), _Section 5.2 _(Authority;
No Breach), _Section 6.1_ (Organization, Standing and Corporate Power) and
_Section 6.2_ (Authority; No Breach) must be made no later than the
date that is six (6) years after the Closing Date, (2) _Section 4.16_
(Employee Benefits) must be made no later than the 36 month anniversary of the
Closing Date and (3) _Section 4.20_ (Environmental Matters) must be made no
later than the 60 month anniversary of the Closing Date.

(ii) All other claims for indemnification under this  _Article 11_ must be
made no later than the date that is six (6) years after the Closing Date.

(d) With respect to any matters covered by _Section 11.2_ or _Section
11.3_, as the case may be, the Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assert all claims under all applicable insurance
policies and any indemnification claim shall be net of any insurance proceeds
received by the Indemnified Party (net of any deductible amounts and costs of
collection) and, to the extent that insurance proceeds are collected

 



57  by the Indemnified Party after an indemnification claim has been settled,
the Indemnified Party will restore the Indemnifying Party to the same economic
position as would have existed had such insurance proceeds been collected
prior to the settlement of such claim.

(e) The amounts for which an Indemnifying Party shall be liable under
_Section 11.2_ or _Section 11.3_, as the case may be, shall be net of any
Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party as a result of the
facts and circumstances giving rise to the liability of the Indemnifying
Party in the tax year of the Indemnifying Party in which the claim is first
asserted or in the next taxable year thereafter. The Indemnified Party shall
reimburse the Indemnifying Party for such tax benefit to the extent such
amount is subsequently realized by the Indemnified Party after an
indemnification claim has been settled so long as the tax benefit is realized
for such a taxable period.

 

(f) If any of the Losses for which an Indemnifying Party is responsible under
_Section 11.2_ or  _Section 11.3_ are reasonably recoverable against a
third party vendor of the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party will,
to the extent pursuing recovery from such vendor would be commercially
reasonable, attempt in good faith to collect any and all such Losses on
account thereof from such vendor for the benefit of the Indemnifying Party.
The Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any and all
Losses paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Agreement to the extent such amount is subsequently received by the
Indemnified Party from a vendor, net of any costs of collection.

 

(g) The Indemnified Party agrees to take all commercially reasonable actions
required by Law to mitigate Losses upon becoming aware of any claim which may
be made for indemnification under _Section 11.2_ or _Section 11.3_, as the
case may be; provided however (i) in no event will Buyer be required to pursue
any claim or Proceeding against a customer; and (ii) if a prudent Person
would believe that a potential mitigation action would be reasonably likely to
give rise to an additional, possibly non-indemnified harm, then the
Indemnified Party will not be required to take that action unless (aa) the
Indemnifying Party expressly acknowledges its obligation to provide
indemnification for Losses as well as any Losses that might arise from the
proposed mitigation and (bb) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that
such indemnification with respect to such additional Losses will be available
and sufficient to hold Indemnified Party harmless.

 

(h) The Indemnified Parties may not recover duplicative Losses in respect of a
single set of facts or circumstances under more than one representation,
warranty or covenant in this Agreement whether such facts or circumstances
would give rise to a breach of more than one representation, warranty or
covenant in this Agreement.

 

(i) The parties acknowledge and agree that the Bring-Down Certificates to be
delivered at the Closing under Sections 3.2(e) and 3.3(d) are intended solely
to memorialize satisfaction of the condition to the Closing set forth in
Sections 3.2(e) and 3.3(d), respectively, and are not intended to function as
personal representations and warranties of the individual(s) executing such
Bring-Down Certificates. Rather, the only representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the representations and warranties of the applicable
parties set forth in Articles 4, 5 and 6 of this Agreement, as the case may
be.

 



58 11.5 _Indemnification Claims Procedures_.

 

(a) If a Buyer Indemnified Party becomes aware of a claim for indemnification
under _Section 11.3(a)_ or  _Section 11.3(c)_, it will promptly notify
Seller of the claim, or if under _Section 11.3(b)_, it will promptly notify
the relevant Seller Shareholder of the claim, and if a Seller Indemnified
Party becomes aware of a claim for indemnification under _Section 11.2_, it
will promptly notify Buyer of the claim (in each case, the giver of such
notification being referred to hereafter as the " _Indemnified Party_ ," and
the recipient of such notification being referred to hereafter as the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "). Such indemnification notice will specify in
reasonable detail, to the extent then known, the nature of the Losses suffered
and the facts giving rise to the claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but
subject to _Section 11.4(c)_, any failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its indemnification obligations
or other Liabilities hereunder except to the extent (and only to the extent)
that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of the matter is
materially prejudiced thereby.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party will have 30 days after receipt of the
indemnification notice to notify the Indemnified Party in writing of any
objections thereto, specifying in reasonable detail the nature of and basis
for each objection. To the extent that the Indemnifying Party fails to timely
object to all or part of an indemnification claim, the Indemnifying Party
will be deemed to have irrevocably accepted Liability for the claim. To the
extent that the Indemnifying Party timely objects to all or part of an
indemnification claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will
negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute within 30 days thereafter. If
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are unable to resolve the
dispute within that 30 day period, then either of them may proceed to
arbitration and mediation with respect to the dispute as provided in _Section
12.8_.

(c) No action by an Indemnified Party to determine the extent of an
indemnified Liability, including voluntary disclosure to Authorities or
potential claimants, will in any way affect a partys right to indemnification
under this Agreement.

 

(d) The Seller Shareholders acknowledge and agree that any action taken by the
Seller in its capacity as the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _ARTICLE
11_ with regard to any claim brought by an Indemnified Party under _Section
11.3(a)_ will be binding upon the Seller Shareholders and in no way limit or
modify the Seller Shareholders indemnification obligations under _Section
11.3(a)_.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary
(other than the proviso set forth in _Section 11.3(a)(ii)_ and _11.3(b)(ii)_
), nothing shall prevent a Buyer Indemnified Party from making any claim for
indemnification under any of _Sections 11.3(a)(ii)_ through _11.3(a)(vii)_ , 
_Sections 11.3(b)(ii)_ or _(b)(iii)_ or _Section 11.3(c)_ even if such
indemnification claim could have been brought under _Section 11.3(a)(i)_ or
_11.3(b)(i)_.

 



59 11.6 _Payment of Indemnification Claims_.

 

(a) With regard to any claim asserted against an Indemnified Party in a
Proceeding (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") for which indemnification is payable
hereunder, such indemnification will become immediately due and payable,
without further notice or demand, upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the entry
of a judgment against the Indemnified Party and the expiration of any
applicable appeal period or, if earlier, 10 days prior to the date that the
judgment creditor has the right to execute the judgment; (ii) the entry of a
nonappealable judgment or final appellate decision against the Indemnified
Party; (iii) a settlement of the Third Party Claim; or (iv) with respect to
indemnities for any Liability for Taxes, 10 days following the issuance of an
Order by a Tax Authority; _provided_ that, reasonable expenses of counsel to
the Indemnified Party, together with other reasonable costs and expenses
(including any appeal bonds), will be reimbursed on a current basis (subject
to _Section 11.7(b)(i))_.

 

(b) With regard to any claim not involving a Third Party Claim for which
indemnification is payable hereunder, such indemnification will become
immediately due and payable, without further notice or demand, upon the
earliest to occur of: (i) the expiration of the period for objecting to the
claim under _Section 11.5(b)_ unless an objection has been duly made; (ii)
the date the dispute is resolved by mutual written agreement of the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party under _Section 11.5(b)_; (iii)
the entry of a judgment in favor of the Indemnified Party in an action
brought to enforce this Agreement and the expiration of any applicable appeal
period or, if earlier, 10 days prior to the date that the judgment creditor
has the right to execute the judgment; (iv) the entry of a nonappealable
judgment or final appellate decision in favor of the Indemnified Party in an
action brought to enforce this Agreement; or (v) a settlement of an action
brought by the Indemnified Party to enforce this Agreement.

 

11.7 _Third Party Proceedings_.

 

(a) The Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim and, subject to  _Section 11.7(d)_, may elect to
assume the defense of and control resolution of the Third Party Claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party by delivering written
notice of the election within 10 Business Days after receiving notice of the
Third Party Claim as provided in _Section 11.5_.

(b) If an Indemnifying Party timely elects to assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim:

(i) the Indemnifying Party will not, so long as it conducts the defense in a
commercially reasonable manner, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this
_ARTICLE 11_ for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect
to the defense of the Third Party Claim, in each case subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of the Third
Party Claim;

 



60 (ii) the assumption will conclusively establish for purposes of this
Agreement that the claims asserted in the Third Party Claim are within the
scope of and subject to indemnification; and

(iii) no compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim may be effected by
the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys consent (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless (1) the
compromise or settlement includes a grant by each claimant or plaintiff of a
full, unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all Liabilities
arising from or relating to the claim; (2) the sole relief provided for is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party (or its
Affiliates); and (3) the terms of the compromise or settlement are strictly
confidential among the parties thereto, and any copies required to be filed
with any Authority are filed under seal or similar measures are taken to
ensure confidential treatment thereof.

(c) If an Indemnifying Party does not timely elect to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party will be bound by any
determination made in the Proceeding or any compromise or settlement effected
by the Indemnified Party in good faith.

 

(d) Notwithstanding _Section 11.7(a)_, an Indemnified Party may retain or
assume the exclusive right to defend, settle or compromise a Third Party
Claim if the Indemnified Party reasonably determines in good faith that (i)
the claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal or quasi-
criminal matter; (ii) the claim seeks or is likely to seek an injunction or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (iii) there is or may be
a conflict of interest (aside from the parties respective rights and
obligations hereunder) between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party; (iv) the Indemnifying Party is not defending the claim in a
commercially reasonable manner; or (v) the Indemnifying Party does not, or is
not likely to, have the financial capacity to defend the claim and
provide indemnification with respect to the claim. In any case where an
Indemnified Party asserts its rights hereunder, no compromise or settlement of
the Third Party Claim may be effected by the Indemnified Party without the
Indemnifying Partys consent unless the compromise or settlement includes a
grant by each claimant or plaintiff of a full, unconditional release of the
Indemnifying Party from all Liabilities arising from or relating to the claim.

 

(e) The Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, that
is controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim will keep the other
reasonably informed of the Proceeding at all stages thereof, whether or not
the other is represented by counsel. Each party agrees to render to each other
such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper
and adequate defense of a Third Party Claim. Each party will cooperate with
the other and provide such assistance, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, as such other party may reasonably request in connection
with the defense of the Third Party Claim, including providing such other
party with reasonable access to and reasonable use of all relevant corporate
records and making its officers and employees reasonably available for
depositions, pretrial discovery and as witnesses at trial, if required. In
requesting any such cooperation, the party requesting

 



61  such assistance will have due regard for, and attempt to not be disruptive
of, the business and day to day operations of the other party and will follow
all reasonable requests of the other party regarding any documents or
instruments which such party believes should be given confidential treatment.

11.8 _Tax Treatment_. For Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law, the
parties agree to treat all payments made under this _ARTICLE 11_ , and any
payments in respect of any Breaches of representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements hereunder, as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

11.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, except for claims based on fraud,
knowing and intentional misconduct or willful misconduct, the rights and
remedies set forth in this _ARTICLE 11_ are the sole and exclusive rights and
remedies of any Indemnified Party under or in connection with this Agreement,
except that nothing in this Agreement will limit any right to injunctive or
other equitable relief.

(b) The Seller Disclosure Schedule is divided into sections which correspond

Schedule relate

 



62  only to the representations and warranties in the sections of this Agreement
to which they correspond and not to any other representation or warranty in
this Agreement, except to the extent that (i) a section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule expressly refers to another section thereof by specific
cross reference or (ii) it is reasonably apparent from the text of a
particular disclosure that the disclosure also applies to
another representation or warranty. The Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not
vary, change or alter the literal meaning of the representations and
warranties of _ARTICLE 4_ or _ARTICLE 5_ hereof, other than creating
exceptions thereto or listing applicable items, in each case which are
responsive to the language of the warranties and representations contained in
this Agreement.

 

(c) The term "to its knowledge" or similar statements means, with respect to

this Agreement.

any provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement that is duly
executed by Seller will be binding against that Seller Shareholder except

any material modification of the (a) representations or warranties regarding
such Seller Shareholder set forth in _ARTICLE 5_ , (b) the express covenants
and obligations of such Seller Shareholder set forth in _ARTICLE 7_ , _ARTICLE
8_ or _Section 11.3(b)_, or (c) the limitation on such Seller Shareholders
liability set forth in  _Section 11.4(b)_.

 



63 12.3 _Waiver of Compliance; Consents_. Any failure of a party to comply with
any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be expressly
waived in writing by the party entitled to compliance, but any waiver or
failure to insist upon strict compliance with the obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure. No single or partial exercise of
a right or remedy will preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of
any other right or remedy hereunder. Whenever this Agreement requires or
permits the consent by or on behalf of a party, the consent must be given in
writing in the same manner as for waivers of compliance. The foregoing
notwithstanding, each Seller Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that any
waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement that is
duly executed by Seller will be binding against that Seller Shareholder.

 

12.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement will entitle
any Person (other than a party hereto and its respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby) to any claim, cause of action, remedy or right of
any kind.

12.5 _Fees and Expenses_. Each of the parties hereto will bear its own costs,
fees and expenses in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including fees, commissions and expenses
payable to brokers, finders, investment bankers, consultants, exchange or
transfer agents, attorneys, accountants and other professionals; provided

Act and such fee shall be non-refundable in all cases.

Seller Shareholder hereby designates the above-named individual as its agent

designee is given in accordance herewith.

 

12.7 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and permitted assigns,
but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder may be assigned (whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of
law or otherwise) by Seller or the Seller Shareholders without the prior
written consent of Buyer. Prior to Closing, Buyer may not assign (whether
voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise) this Agreement,
in whole or in part, without the consent of Seller or Seller Shareholders,
except that Buyer may assign this Agreement, in whole or in any part and from
time to time, to any Subsidiary or other Affiliate of Buyer provided Buyer
remains bound by this Agreement jointly and severally with any such assignee.
Subject to the terms of the Promissory Note, after Closing, Buyer may assign
(whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise) this
Agreement, in whole or in any part and from time to time without the consent
of Seller or the Seller Shareholders provided Buyer remains bound by this
Agreement jointly and severally with any such assignee. Any assignment or
purported assignment in violation of this _Section 12.7_ will be void and of
no force or effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
solely for purposes of clarity, the foregoing restriction on assignment
prohibits and invalidates any assignment, distribution or other transfer (and
any purported assignment, distribution or other transfer) of any rights to
receive or other interest in or with respect to the purchase price payable
hereunder.

 



65 12.8 _Governing Law; Arbitration and Mediation_.

 

(a) This Agreement and, except as otherwise expressly stated therein, the
Ancillary Documents, and the legal relations among the parties hereto will be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal substantive laws of
the State of Delaware (without regard to the laws of conflict that might
otherwise apply) as to all matters, including matters of
validity, construction, effect, performance and remedies.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in _Sections 8.2_ and _8.3_ , all Arbitrable
Claims arising between the parties in connection with this Agreement will be
finally resolved by arbitration administered by JAMS under and in accordance
with its JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, and judgment
on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having
competent jurisdiction. The term " _Arbitrable Claims_ " means any claims,
disputes, controversies, demands, causes of action (whether arising under
state or federal statutes, equity, the common law or any other applicable
Law), damages, claims or demands for equitable relief, other matters in
question between or among Seller, the Seller Shareholders and Buyer under this
Agreement or arising out of the negotiation, execution, delivery (including
the fraudulent inducement thereof), or performance of this Agreement and other
matters for which this Agreement specifically provides for arbitration, but
specifically excludes any matters of injunctive relief or specific
performance specifically reserved to a party under this Agreement. Disputes
will be identified by the aggrieved party by notice of dispute in writing to
the other party setting forth with particularity the issues responsible
for the dispute. Upon receipt of such notice, the parties will attempt in
good faith to resolve the dispute and, if they fail to resolve the dispute,
will mediate such dispute pursuant to _Section 12.8(c)_ prior to submitting
the dispute to arbitration. In the event that the parties cannot amicably
resolve the issues prior to or as a result of mediation, the dispute will be
submitted to arbitration. The arbitration will take place in Chicago,
Illinois. The party initiating arbitration will request a list of five
impartial arbitrators from the office of JAMS located in or nearest the city
in which the arbitration is to take place. From this list, the parties will
alternately strike arbitrators (with the party initiating arbitration making
the first strike) until one name is left. The parties agree to facilitate the
arbitration by: (a) conducting arbitration hearings to the greatest extent
possible on successive, contiguous days; and (b) observing strictly the time
periods established by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures
or by the arbitrator(s) for the submission of evidence and briefs. Discovery
in the arbitration will be as limited as reasonably possible and in no event
will a party be entitled to take more than three depositions (each deposition
completed in no more than seven hours), ask more than ten narrowly focused
interrogatories (sub-parts of an interrogatory deemed as a separate
interrogation), or make more than fifteen narrowly focused document requests
(sub-parts of a request deemed as a separate request). Any up-front fees
payable to the arbitrator(s) or like up-front fees will be divided equally
between Buyer and Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that the prevailing party
will be reimbursed its costs, including reasonable attorneys fees and
arbitration expenses, proportionate to the degree of its success from the
other party if, and only to the extent, expressly determined in
the arbitrators award.

 



66 (c) Arbitrable Claims will be submitted to mediation (assuming other good
faith attempts to resolve the dispute have failed) prior to submitting such
claim to arbitration pursuant to _Section 12.8(b)_. The mediation will take
place in Chicago, Illinois, unless another location is agreed by the parties.
If the parties are unable to agree upon a mediator, each party will select a
mediator, which mediators in turn will select the mediator of the dispute.
Each partys representation at the mediation will include a business
representative having full settlement authority. The parties will use best
efforts to schedule the mediation within 30 days of the delivery of a request
for mediation. Any mediation will be non-binding and anything presented in any
mediation will be subject to Federal Rule of Evidence 408. The parties
acknowledge that they agree to mediate disputes in hopes of amicably resolving
the matter before incurring significant attorneys fees which may act as a
barrier to settlement of the dispute at a later time. Accordingly,
the parties will mediate in good faith and use reasonable efforts to reach a
resolution of the matter.

12.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents may
be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an
original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement and the Ancillary Documents will become effective
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties. This Agreement and the Ancillary Documents may
be executed and delivered by facsimile or pdf transmission and a facsimile or
pdf transmission will constitute an original for all purposes, except as may
be otherwise required by law. At the request of any party, the parties will
confirm a facsimile or pdf transmission by signing a duplicate original
document.

 

12.10 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are Breached. Therefore, each party (a) hereby waives, in any action
for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and
any requirement for the posting of any bond or other security in connection
with any such remedy; and (b) agrees that the other parties will be entitled
to specific performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents in any
Proceeding initiated to enforce the terms hereof, including the issuance of
an Order or Orders to prevent or restrain any actual or threatened Breach of
this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, in each case without any
requirement to post any bond or provide other security. The remedy of
specific performance will be in addition to any other remedy or remedies to
which the other parties may be entitled at law or in equity. The provisions of
_Sections 8.2(c)_ and _8.3(c)_ hereof shall govern and control, with respect
to the matters set forth therein, over this _Section 12.10_.

12.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the appendices, addenda,
annexes, exhibits and schedules hereto, embodies the entire agreement and
understanding of the parties in respect of the subject matter contained herein
and supersedes all prior agreements and the understandings between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement (including the
Letter of Intent dated September 3, 2014 among Buyer, Seller and the Seller
Shareholders), other than the Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality
Agreement will terminate and cease to be of any further force or effect as of
the Closing; _provided_ that Buyer shall remain bound thereby for the
Restricted Period with respect to confidential information (as

 



67  defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) of Seller that is not Confidential
Information within the meaning of this Agreement and does not otherwise relate
to the Business, including (i) confidential information specifically
regarding the Selling Shareholders and/or, (ii) confidential information
specifically and exclusively related to the Systems Control business division
of Seller. No discussions regarding, or exchange of drafts or comments in
connection with, the transactions contemplated herein will constitute an
agreement among the parties hereto or modify the terms of this Agreement. Any
agreement among the parties will exist only when the parties have fully
executed and delivered this Agreement or any amendments hereto adopted as
provided herein.

12.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Documents is held to be invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other terms and
provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economics or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon determination that any term or other provision hereof is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto will
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement or such Ancillary Document,
as applicable, so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the greatest extent possible. The provisions of _Section 8.3(c)_
shall govern and control shall govern and control, with respect to the
matters set forth therein, over this _Section 12.12_.

12.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. THE PARTIES WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OF
ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS, OR THE MAKING, PERFORMANCE OR INTERPRETATION THEREOF,
INCLUDING FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT THEREOF.
