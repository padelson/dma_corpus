<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(a) This Agreement and, except as otherwise expressly stated therein, the Ancillary Documents, and the legal relations among
the parties hereto will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to the laws of conflict that might otherwise apply) as to all matters, including matters of validity,
construction, effect, performance and remedies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) Except as otherwise provided in <U>Sections 8.2</U> and <U>8.3</U>,
all Arbitrable Claims arising between the parties in connection with this Agreement will be finally resolved by arbitration administered by JAMS under and in accordance with its JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, and judgment on
the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having competent jurisdiction. The term &#147;<U>Arbitrable Claims</U>&#148; means any claims, disputes, controversies, demands, causes of action (whether arising under state or
federal statutes, equity, the common law or any other applicable Law), damages, claims or demands for equitable relief, other matters in question between or among Seller, the Seller Shareholders and Buyer under this Agreement or arising out of the
negotiation, execution, delivery (including the fraudulent inducement thereof), or performance of this Agreement and other matters for which this Agreement specifically provides for arbitration, but specifically excludes any matters of injunctive
relief or specific performance specifically reserved to a party under this Agreement. Disputes will be identified by the aggrieved party by notice of dispute in writing to the other party setting forth with particularity the issues responsible for
the dispute. Upon receipt of such notice, the parties will attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute and, if they fail to resolve the dispute, will mediate such dispute pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;12.8(c)</U> prior to submitting the dispute to
arbitration. In the event that the parties cannot amicably resolve the issues prior to or as a result of mediation, the dispute will be submitted to arbitration. The arbitration will take place in Chicago, Illinois. The party initiating arbitration
will request a list of five impartial arbitrators from the office of JAMS located in or nearest the city in which the arbitration is to take place. From this list, the parties will alternately strike arbitrators (with the party initiating
arbitration making the first strike) until one name is left. The parties agree to facilitate the arbitration by: (a)&nbsp;conducting arbitration hearings to the greatest extent possible on successive, contiguous days; and (b)&nbsp;observing strictly
the time periods established by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures or by the arbitrator(s) for the submission of evidence and briefs. Discovery in the arbitration will be as limited as reasonably possible and in no event will a
party be entitled to take more than three depositions (each deposition completed in no more than seven hours), ask more than ten narrowly focused interrogatories (sub-parts of an interrogatory deemed as a separate interrogation), or make more than
fifteen narrowly focused document requests (sub-parts of a request deemed as a separate request). Any up-front fees payable to the arbitrator(s) or like up-front fees will be divided equally between Buyer and Seller; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>,
that the prevailing party will be reimbursed its costs, including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and arbitration expenses, proportionate to the degree of its success from the other party if, and only to the extent, expressly determined in the
arbitrator&#146;s award. </P>

attempts to resolve the dispute have failed) prior to submitting such claim to arbitration pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;12.8(b)</U>. The mediation will take place in Chicago, Illinois, unless another location is agreed by the parties. If the parties
are unable to agree upon a mediator, each party will select a mediator, which mediators in turn will select the mediator of the dispute. Each party&#146;s representation at the mediation will include a business representative having full settlement
authority. The parties will use best efforts to schedule the mediation within 30 days of the delivery of a request for mediation. Any mediation will be non-binding and anything presented in any mediation will be subject to Federal Rule of Evidence
408. The parties acknowledge that they agree to mediate disputes in hopes of amicably resolving the matter before incurring significant attorneys&#146; fees which may act as a barrier to settlement of the dispute at a later time. Accordingly, the
parties will mediate in good faith and use reasonable efforts to reach a resolution of the matter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">12.9 <U>Counterparts</U>. This
