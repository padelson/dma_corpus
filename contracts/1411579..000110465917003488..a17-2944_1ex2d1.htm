payment (including on any increased payment) but ignoring any penalty or
interest payable in connection with any failure to pay or any delay in paying
any such Tax due (in either case) to the fault of the payee, the payee is in

no such Tax chargeable.

end of a Member State competent authoritys Phase I period of review if a
referral described in Clause 4.1(a)(ii) is made. Such steps shall include, but
are not limited to, proposing, negotiating, offering to commit and agreeing,

thereto (to the extent such information relates to the Company and provided

4.1;

 



 

(G) to the extent permitted by law to notify in writing to the Institutional
Sellers Representative anything which will or is likely to prevent the
Condition from being satisfied on or before the Long Stop Date promptly after
it comes to its notice; and

 



 

(H) to agree and implement any Remedies that may be required by the European
Commission and/or competent authority of any Member State prior to the
Completion Date and, failing that, within six months of Completion or other
period as required by the clearance

a strictly confidential basis and shall not be provided to the Purchaser;

 



 

(B) in relation to the Transaction only, notify the Purchasers advisers of

fraud of any Sellers, the Company of any member of the Group (or any of their

11.3 **Adjustment for Leakage**

 



 

(a) If any Leakage is notified or comes to the attention of the Purchaser on

(i) in the event that a Seller has not notified the Purchaser of such Leakage,
subject to the relevant Seller (the " **Relevant Seller** ") agreeing that
Leakage has occurred and agreeing the amount to be paid by the Relevant Seller
pursuant to Clause 11.4(a) in respect of such Leakage (an " **Agreed Leakage
Amount** "), the Purchaser shall be entitled to reduce the Consideration to be
paid to the Relevant Seller pursuant to Clause 3 by the full amount of the
Agreed Leakage Amount by reducing the amount of Consideration to be paid to
the Relevant Seller (and the payment of the amount of the Consideration so
reduced shall be an absolute discharge of the Purchasers obligations

Leakage in accordance with Clause 11.4(b).

 



 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt:

 



 

(i) the fact that any Leakage comes to the attention of the Purchaser on or
prior to Completion but no Agreed Leakage Amount is agreed in respect of it
pursuant to this Clause 11.3 shall not affect the Sellers obligations or the
Purchasers rights pursuant to Clauses 11.1 and 11.4 or otherwise under this
Agreement in respect of that Leakage; and

 



 

(ii) the fact that an Agreed Leakage Amount has been agreed or a Leakage Set-
off Amount has reduced the amount of Consideration payable by the Purchaser
pursuant to this Clause 11.3 in respect of any Leakage shall not preclude the
Purchaser from recovering any further amounts payable under Clause 11.4 in
respect of such Leakage and not taken into account in the Agreed Leakage
Amount or the Leakage Set-off Amount.

 



 

11.4 **Payment for Leakage**

amount in cash in SEK equal to:

 



 

(i) the amount of such Leakage;

 



 

(ii) all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
damages, legal and other professional fees and costs, penalties and expenses)
incurred by the Purchaser as a result of such Leakage; and

 



 

(iii) any amount necessary to ensure that after any Tax on a payment made in
accordance with sub-clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Purchaser is left with the
same amount it would have had if the payment was not subject to Tax,

 



 

save that, for the avoidance of doubt, any amount already taken into account
in the calculation of any Agreed Leakage Amount or Leakage Set-off Amount and
taken into account in the determination of the Consideration pursuant to
Clause 11.3 shall not be recoverable under this Clause 11.4 after Completion.

 



 

(b) In respect of any Leakage that is not received or benefitted from by one
or more Sellers (or by any member of an Institutional Sellers Group or any
Connected Person of a Management Seller), each Seller shall be deemed to have
received or benefitted from its Pro Rata Portion of such Leakage and each
Seller shall on demand by the Purchaser pay to the Purchaser its Pro Rata
Portion of the aggregate amount to be paid to the Purchaser pursuant to Clause
11.4(a) in respect of such Leakage For the purposes of this Clause 11.4(a), "
**Pro Rata Portion** ", shall mean in relation to any Seller, that Sellers

knowingly directly or indirectly interfere or attempt to interfere with the
continuance of supplies to any Group Company from any supplier who has been

(b) for a period of one year immediately following the Completion Date,
knowingly directly or indirectly solicit, endeavour to entice away from any

three per cent. of any class of shares or securities of any company which is
dealt on any recognised stock exchange (as defined by the Financial Services

each Group Company that they will not, and that they will procure that no
member of their respective Institutional Sellers Group (provided that, in the

Connected Person of a Management Seller terminates (a) the side letter between
Bonnier and Bridgepoint Europe V Investments S.a r.l. in respect of the SF
rebranding and (b) all such agreements between it and any Group Company (other
than (i) the Shareholder Loan Agreements; (ii) any service contract between a
Management Seller and a Group Company that has been Disclosed in the Data
Room; and (iii) the SF Licence Agreements) and irrevocably waives, and shall
procure that each member of an Institutional Sellers Group and each Connected
Person of a Management Seller waives, any and all claims any such person may
have in its capacity as shareholder, director or employee (as applicable)
against any Group Company or any other direct or indirect party (other than
any claim arising under the aforementioned service contracts).

 



 

 **14.** **Guarantee**

 



 

14.1 In consideration of the Sellers entering into this Agreement, the
Purchaser Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the
Sellers the due and punctual performance and observance by the Purchaser of
all its obligations, commitments, undertakings and warranties undertaken or
expressed to be undertaken under or pursuant to this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the obligations contained in Clause 4.2(a)(ii)(C)) to
which it is party including the payment of court-awarded damages for breach of
those obligations, commitments, undertakings and warranties along with any
court-awarded legal costs arising from claiming for such damages (the "
**Guaranteed Obligations** ").

 



 

14.2 If and whenever the Purchaser defaults for any reason whatsoever in the
performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Purchaser Guarantor
shall forthwith, upon demand, unconditionally perform (or procure performance
of) and satisfy (or procure the satisfaction of) the Guaranteed Obligations in
regard to which such default has been made in the manner prescribed by this
Agreement and so that the same benefits shall be conferred on the Sellers as
they would have received if the Guaranteed Obligations had been duly performed
and satisfied by the Purchaser.

 



 

14.3 This guarantee is to be a continuing guarantee and, accordingly, is to
remain in force until all the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been performed
or satisfied notwithstanding the winding up, liquidation, dissolution or other
incapacity of the Purchaser. This guarantee is in addition to and without
prejudice to and not in substitution for any rights or security which the
Sellers may now or hereafter have or hold for the performance and observance
of the Guaranteed Obligations.

 



 

14.4 As a separate and independent stipulation, the Purchaser Guarantor agrees
that any of the Guaranteed Obligations (including any moneys payable) which
may not be enforceable against or recoverable from the Purchaser by reason of
any legal limitation, disability or incapacity on or of the Purchaser or the
dissolution, amalgamation, reconstruction or reorganisation of the Purchaser
or any other fact or circumstance (other than any limitation imposed by this
Agreement) shall nevertheless be enforceable against and recoverable from the
Purchaser Guarantor as though the same had been incurred by the Purchaser
Guarantor and the Purchaser Guarantor were the sole or principal obligor in
respect thereof and shall be performed or paid by the Purchaser Guarantor on
demand.

 



 

14.5 The Purchaser Guarantor, as principal obligor and as a separate and
independent obligation and liability from its obligations and liabilities in
Clause 14.1, undertakes to indemnify and keep indemnified the Sellers against
all costs, claims, expenses, losses, damages and liabilities which the Sellers
may incur or suffer arising out of or in connection with any breach by the
Purchaser of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

14.6 The liability of the Purchaser Guarantor under this Clause 14 shall not
be affected, impaired, reduced or released by:

 



 

(a) any variation of the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not
agreed by the Purchaser);

 



 

(b) any forbearance, neglect or delay in seeking performance of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any granting of time for, or waiver in relation to, such
performance;

 



 

(c) any agreement or arrangement which the Sellers make with the Purchaser or
with any person which (but for this Clause 14.6(c)) would or might operate to
diminish or discharge the liability of a surety;

 



 

(d) any change in the status, control or ownership of the Purchaser;

 



 

(e) any change in the constitution or control of, or the insolvency of, or
bankruptcy, winding-up or analogous proceedings relating to, the Purchaser;

 



 

(f) any illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any obligation of any
person under this Agreement; or

 



 

(g) any other act, event or omission which might operate to discharge, impair
or otherwise affect any of the obligations of the Guarantor or any of the
rights, powers and remedies conferred on the Sellers under this Agreement.

 



 

14.7 The Purchaser Guarantor waives all rights it has or may have to require
the Sellers to proceed first against the Purchaser.

 



 

14.8 The guarantee and indemnity in this Clause 14 shall extend to all costs
and reasonable expenses incurred by the Sellers in enforcing such guarantee
and indemnity.

 



 

14.9 The Purchaser Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that damages may not be
an adequate remedy for breach of the guarantee and indemnity in this Clause 14
and that the Sellers shall have the right to require specific performance of
the Purchaser Guarantors obligations under this Clause 14. The Purchaser
agrees not to object to any application by the Sellers for such specific
performance.

 



 

 **15.** **Waiver**

 



 

15.1 Subject to Completion under Clause 7 having taken place, each of the
Institutional Sellers in respect of itself and its respective Institutional
Sellers Affiliates (which in respect of European Cinemas shall exclude any
portfolio companies of any of its Institutional Sellers Affiliates and any
investors in any such Institutional Sellers Affiliates) confirms that as at
the date of this Agreement (i) all sums due to a Group Company or NCG JVCo
from that Seller have been repaid in full and (ii) it does not have any claims
or rights or causes of action against any Group Company or any directors or
officers of any Group Company other than in respect of any Permitted Leakage.

 



 

15.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
Institutional Seller, nor any member of an Institutional Sellers Group, and
no Management Seller or any Connected Person of any Management Seller (other
than the Purchaser) shall have any rights or claims against any debt financing
source (including, without limitation, any lenders, lead arrangers, book-
runners, syndication agents or similar entities) in connection with this
Agreement, the Purchaser Debt Finance or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby.

information relating to the business, financial or other affairs (including

listed (including where this is required as part of any actual or potential
offering, placing and/or sale of securities of that Party or member of the
Institutional Sellers Group or member of the Purchasers Group);

relevant Management Seller, as the case may be;

 **17.** **Appointment of Representative**

 



 

17.1 The Management Sellers hereby appoint Jan Bernhardsson as their
representative who may, acting alone, authorise the making of any request,
election, proposal or consent expressed to be made on behalf of the Management
Sellers (in their capacity as Management Sellers) to the Purchaser or to the
Institutional Sellers. The Management Sellers shall be bound by the actions
taken by the Management Sellers Representative pursuant to this Clause. The
Purchaser shall be entitled at its sole discretion to have regard only to, and
to rely absolutely upon and act in accordance with, without any liability to
any party for having relied or acted thereon, notices, including requests,
elections or proposals, issued by the Management Sellers Representative.
Service of any notice or other communication on the Management Sellers
Representative shall be deemed to constitute valid service thereof on all the
Management Sellers. The Management Sellers may appoint a replacement
Management Sellers Representative by decision taken by Management Sellers
representing a two thirds majority of the aggregate number of A Ordinary
Shares and B Preference Shares held by the Management Sellers in the capital
of the Company immediately prior to Completion, provided that five (5)
Business Days prior written notice of such appointment has been given to the
Institutional Sellers Representative and the Purchaser. The Management
Sellers Representative shall not be liable to any of the Management Sellers
for any claims whatsoever arising from any act or omission undertaken by him
in his capacity as the Management Sellers Representative, save in the case of

17.2 The Institutional Sellers hereby appoint Mika Herold as their
representative who may, acting alone, authorise the making of any request,
election, proposal or consent expressed to be made on behalf of the

Purchaser or to the Management Sellers. The Institutional Sellers shall be
bound by the actions taken by the Institutional Sellers Representative
pursuant to this Clause. The Purchaser shall be entitled at its sole
discretion to have regard only to, and to rely absolutely

 



      
 

 



 

upon and act in accordance with, without any liability to any party for having
relied or acted thereon, notices, including requests, elections or proposals,
issued by the Institutional Sellers Representative. The Institutional
Sellers Representative shall not issue any of the same nor make any such
request, election, proposal or consent where such issuance or action would
adversely affect any Institutional Seller disproportionately to any other
Institutional Seller. Service of any notice or other communication on the
Institutional Sellers Representative shall be deemed to constitute valid
service thereof on all the Institutional Sellers. The Institutional Sellers
Representative shall pass any notices received pursuant to this Agreement on
behalf of an Institutional Seller to such Institutional Seller without undue
delay. The Institutional Sellers may appoint a replacement Institutional
Sellers Representative by decision taken by Institutional Sellers
representing a two thirds majority of the aggregate number of A Ordinary
Shares and B Preference Shares held by the Institutional Sellers in the
capital of the Company immediately prior to Completion, provided that five (5)
Business Days prior written notice of such appointment has been given to the
Purchaser and the Management Sellers Representative. The Institutional
Sellers Representative shall not be liable to any of the Institutional
Sellers for any claims whatsoever arising from any act or omission undertaken
by him in his capacity as the Institutional Sellers Representative, save in
the case of fraud or wilful default.

 



 

 **18.** **Costs**

 



 

Except where this Agreement provides otherwise or where otherwise mutually
agreed by the Parties in writing, each Party shall pay its own costs and
expenses in relation to the negotiation, preparation and implementation of
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the Purchaser Debt Finance
Commitment Letters or otherwise incurred in relation to it with a view to the
sale and purchase hereunder, provided that the Company shall not, unless
otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the Parties, pay any additional
Transaction Costs.

 



 

 **19.** **Stamp Duty, Fees and Taxes**

 



 

19.1 The Purchaser shall bear the cost of all stamp duty, notarial fees and
all registration and transfer taxes and duties or their equivalents in all
jurisdictions where such fees, taxes and duties are payable as a result of the
purchase of the Sale Securities. The Purchaser shall be responsible for
arranging the payment of such stamp duty and all other such fees, taxes and
duties, including fulfilling any administrative or reporting obligation
imposed by the jurisdiction in question in connection with such payment.

 



 

19.2 If any Party defaults in the payment when due of any sum payable under
any Transaction Document its liability shall be increased to include interest
on such sum from the date when such payment is due until the date of actual
payment (after as well as before judgement) at a rate per annum of five (5)
per cent above the base rate from time to time of Barclays Bank PLC. Such
interest shall accrue from day to day and shall be compounded monthly.

 



 

 **20.** **Grossing-up**

 



 

20.1 The recipient or expected recipient of a payment under this Agreement
shall claim from the appropriate Taxation Authority any exemption, rate
reduction, refund, credit or similar benefit (including pursuant to any
relevant double tax treaty) to which it is entitled in respect of any
deduction or withholding in respect of which a payment has been or would
otherwise be required to be made pursuant to this Agreement and, for such
purposes, shall, within any applicable time limits, submit any claims,
notices, returns or applications and send a copy of them to the payer.

 



 

20.2 If the recipient of a payment made under this Agreement receives a credit
for or refund of any

 



      
 

 



 

Taxation payable by it or similar benefit by reason of any deduction or
withholding for or on account of Taxation then it shall reimburse to the payer
such part of such additional amounts paid pursuant to this Agreement as the
recipient of the payment certifies to the payer will leave it (after such
reimbursement) in no better and no worse position than would have arisen if
the payer had not been required to make such deduction or withholding.

 



 

 **21.** **Further Assurance**

 



 

21.1 Each Seller undertakes to execute and deliver (at its own cost) all such
instruments and other documents and take all such actions as the Purchaser may
from time to time reasonably require in order to effect the transfer of the
Sale Securities to the Purchaser and otherwise to secure to the Purchaser the
full benefit of this Agreement.

 



 

21.2 Each Seller and the Purchaser each severally undertakes to the other to
take all reasonable steps within its powers as the other may from time to time
reasonably require in order to secure to the other the full benefit of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **22.** **Continuing Obligations**

 



 

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each of the
obligations, warranties and undertakings accepted or given by each of the
Parties or any of them under this Agreement or any document referred to herein
(excluding any obligation which is fully performed on Completion) shall
continue in full force and effect notwithstanding Completion taking place.

 



 

 **23.** **Assignment**

 



 

Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement no Party may
assign, grant any security interest over, hold on trust or otherwise transfer
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, save that:

 



 

(a) after the Completion Date, the Institutional Sellers may assign (in whole
or in part) the benefit of this Agreement to any member of its Institutional
Sellers Group provided that if such assignee ceases to be a member of its
Institutional Sellers Group all benefits relating to this Agreement assigned
to such assignee shall be deemed automatically by that fact to be re-assigned
to the Institutional Seller immediately before such cessation;

 



 

(b) the Purchaser may assign (in whole or in part) the benefit of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document to any other member of the Purchasers
Group provided that if such assignee ceases to be a member of the Purchasers
Group all benefits relating to this Agreement assigned to such assignee shall
be deemed automatically by that fact to be re-assigned to the Purchaser
immediately before such cessation; and

 



 

(c) the Purchaser or any member of the Purchasers Group may charge and/or
assign (in whole or in part) the benefit of this Agreement or any Transaction
Document to any bank or financial institution or other person by way of
security for the purposes of or in connection with the financing or
refinancing (whether in whole or in part) by the Purchaser of the acquisition
of the Sale Securities,

 



 

provided that, any such assignee shall not be entitled to receive under this
Agreement any greater amount than that to which the assignor would have been
entitled and neither the Purchaser nor any Seller shall be under any greater
obligation or liability than if such assignment had never occurred.

 



      
 

 



 

 **24.** **Method of Payment and Set Off**

 



 

24.1 Any payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in full, without
any set off, counterclaim, restriction or condition and without any deduction
or withholding (save as may be permitted by Clause 3.1, Clause 11.3, required
by law, or as otherwise agreed).

 



 

24.2 Save as expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement, any payments
pursuant to this Agreement shall be effected by crediting for same day value

advance and in sufficient details to enable payment by telegraphic or other
electronic means to be effected) on or before the due date for payment.

 



 

24.3 Payment of a sum in accordance with this Clause 24 shall constitute a
payment in full of the sum payable and shall be a good discharge to the payer
(and those on whose behalf such payment is made) of the payers obligation to
make such payment and the payer (and those on whose behalf such payment is
made) shall not be obliged to see to the application of the payment as between
those on whose behalf the payment is received.

relying on any representation, warranty or undertaking not expressly

29.2 Any waiver of a breach of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of

 **Schedule 2**

 



 

 **Warranties**

 



 

Except where the context otherwise requires, the Warranties shall apply not
only to the Company but also to each of the Group Companies as if they had
been expressly repeated with respect to each such Group Company, naming each
one of them in place of the Company throughout.

 



 

In this Schedule "material" shall, in relation to:

 



 

any Warranty set out in paragraphs 9 or 21, require the impact or effect of
any breach of such Warranty to be construed on the basis that that the
materiality of such impact or effect shall be considered separately in
relation to each of:

 



 

(a) any individual Property affected and the business carried out at such
Property alone; and

 



 

(b) all or any number of the Properties and the businesses carried out at the
Properties; and

 



 

any other Warranty, be construed in the context of any breach of such Warranty
as meaning that the loss or damage of the Group arising from the circumstances
giving rise to such breach exceeds the De Minimis Claim Amount.

 



 

 **1.** **The Shares, the Group and Associated Entities**

 



 

1.1 The Company directly or indirectly owns, legally and beneficially, free
from Encumbrances, the whole of the issued share capital of the Group
Companies and all such shares are validly issued and are fully paid. There is
no agreement or commitment (whether actual or contingent) to give or create
any Encumbrance over or affecting any shares in any Group Company or to
otherwise transfer or dispose of any such shares or any interest therein.

 



 

1.2 The Group Companies directly or indirectly owns, legally and beneficially,
free from Encumbrances, the number of shares representing the ownership
percentages as set forth in section 2 of Schedule 1 in the Legal Due Diligence
Report in each Associated Entity and all such shares are validly issued and
are fully paid. There is no agreement or commitment (whether actual or
contingent) to give or create any Encumbrance over or affecting any Group
Companys shares in any Associated Entity or to otherwise transfer or dispose
of any such shares or any interest therein. Remaining ownership percentages in
the Associated Entities are set forth in Section 2 of the Legal Due Diligence
Report, and there are no other shares or other equity interests outstanding in
any Associated Entity.

 



 

1.3 No person has the right (whether exercisable now or in the future and
whether contingent or not) to call for the allotment, conversion, issue,
registration, sale or transfer, redemption or repayment of any share or loan
capital or any other security giving rise to a right over, or an interest in,
the capital of any Group Company or any Associated Entity under any option,
agreement or other arrangement (including conversion rights and rights of pre-
emption).

 



 

1.4 Each Group Company is validly incorporated and validly exists under the
laws of the country in which it is incorporated and has all requisite
corporate powers and authority to own property and carry on its business as
presently conducted.

 



 

1.5 The Company does not have any subsidiary undertakings other than the
Subsidiaries. Save as Disclosed in the Reports, each of the Subsidiaries is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of

 



      
 

 



 

the Company and each of the shares of each such company has been properly
allotted and issued and is fully paid or credited as fully paid.

 



 

1.6 Except for their equity interests in the Associated Entities, no Group
Company owns any shares or stock in the capital of nor has any beneficial or
other interest in any company or business organisation of whatever nature
other than the Subsidiaries and no Group Company controls or takes part in the
management of any other company or business organisation.

 



 

1.7 Save as Disclosed in the Reports, the Company does not have and no
Subsidiary has any branch, division, agency, place of business, operation
outside their respective countries of incorporation.

 



 

 **2.** **Constitution**

 



 

2.1 The statutory books of each Group Company are up to date, in the
possession of the Group and are true and complete in all material respects in
accordance with the relevant Applicable Law for each Company.

 



 

2.2 All resolutions, annual returns and other documents required to be
delivered to the Swedish Companies Registration Office, other relevant company
registry or other corporate authority in any jurisdiction have been properly
prepared, taken and filed and were true and complete.

 



 

 **3.** **Insolvency**

 



 

3.1 No Group Company has made any voluntary arrangement with any of its
creditors, is insolvent (including under Applicable Law) or unable to pay its
debts as they fall due and no such arrangement has been proposed.

 



 

3.2 No order has been made, petition presented or resolution passed for the
winding up of any Group Company or for the appointment of a liquidator to any
Group Company.

 



 

3.3 No Group Company has been nor is in administration and no step has been
taken by any person to place any Group Company in administration.

 



 

3.4 No administrator, receiver or administrative receiver has been appointed
of the whole or part of any Group Companys business or assets.

 



 

3.5 No Group Company has suspended, threatened to suspend or announced an
intention to suspend making payments on any of its debts, and no moratorium
has been declared or has taken effect in respect of any indebtedness of any
Group Company.

 



 

3.6 There are no other bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings including
restructuring, transformation, reorganisation or similar processes concerning

incorporated any open source software into any IT Systems used by the Group
Companies. The Group is in compliance with the material terms and conditions
of all licenses for all open source software listed in the Data Room. The
Group has not used open source software or freeware in the conduct of its
business in any manner which would make the Group Companies obligated to make

 



      
 

 



 

any Intellectual Property Rights available under any open source license
scheme; nor have the Group Companies granted any third party any license to
use any open source software or freeware.

 



 

 **15.** **Compliance with Laws**

accordance with all Applicable Laws and applicable regulations and there is no
investigation, enquiry, order, decree or judgment of any court or governmental
agency outstanding against the Group.

 



 

15.2 All necessary licences, registrations, consents, permits and
authorisations (public and private) have been obtained by each Group Company
to enable it to carry on its business in the places and manner in which such
business is now carried out and all such licenses, registrations, consents,
permits and authorisations are valid and subsisting and there are no
circumstances likely to lead to any of them being suspended, cancelled or
revoked.

 



 

 **16**. **Anti-Bribery and Corruption**

 



 

16.1 No Group Company is engaged in or has at any time in the last three (3)
years been engaged in any activity, practice or conduct which would constitute
an offence pursuant to, or would otherwise be a breach of, applicable Anti-
Bribery Laws, nor has any person (including without limitation any director,
officer, employee, agent or any other third party) who performs or has
performed services for a Group Company bribed another person intending to
obtain or retain business for a Group Company or an advantage in the conduct
of business for a Group Company.

 



 

16.2 During the past three (3) years, no Group Company has received any
written notice alleging that such company or its directors, officers,
employees, agents, or other persons who perform or have performed services on
its behalf has violated any Anti-Bribery Laws, or that such company or its
operations is or may be subject to any investigation, inquiry or enforcement
proceedings related to Anti-Bribery Laws, nor have any such investigations,
inquiries or proceedings been threatened in writing. Prior to the past two (2)
years no such written notice has been received by any Group Company and no
such investigations or proceedings were threatened in writing.

 



 

16.3 During the past three (3) years, no Group Company has carried out any
internal investigation, or made a voluntary disclosure to any governmental or
regulatory authority, in relation to a violation of any Anti-Bribery Law.

 



 

 **17.** **Litigation**

 



 

17.1 No Group Company (or any person for whose acts or defaults a Group
Company may be vicariously liable including its officers) is involved whether
as claimant or defendant or other party in any claim, legal action,
proceeding, suit, litigation, prosecution, investigation, enquiry, mediation
or arbitration (other than as claimant in the collection of debts arising in
the ordinary and usual course of its business) which is likely to result in a
cost to the Group in excess of SEK 2,800,000 (or its equivalent) or is
otherwise material to the business of the Group and there are no circumstances
likely to give rise to such claim, legal action, proceeding, suit, litigation,
prosecution, investigation, enquiry, mediation or arbitration.

 



 

17.2 During the last three (3) years no Group Company is nor has been subject
to any investigation, enquiry, disciplinary, regulatory or criminal proceeding
(whether judicial, quasi-judicial or otherwise), including by any governmental
or local authority, which is material to the operation of such Group Companys
business and no such investigation, enquiry, disciplinary, regulatory or
criminal proceeding is pending or threatened, and the

or for any conduct which constitutes a breach of Antitrust Laws in any
jurisdiction in which a member of the Group is incorporated or conducts
operations.

 



 

17.4 So far as the Management Warrantors are aware, during the last five (5)
years no Group Company nor any agreement, arrangements, understanding,
concerted practice or conduct to which it is or has been a party is or has
been subject to any investigation, inquiry, proceedings, litigation, order,
regulation or decision made by any court or governmental authority (including
any national competition authority and the European Commission) or the subject
of any arbitration or mediation proceedings in connection with any actual,
alleged or suspected infringement of any Antitrust Laws in any jurisdiction in
which a member of the Group is incorporated or conducts operations.

 



 

17.5 Save as Disclosed in the Reports, no Group Company has during the last
five (5) years received a written communication or request for information or
other notice in relation to any aspect of its business from any court or
governmental authority (including any national competition authority and the
European Commission) or from any other person, body, agency or court under any
Antitrust Laws in any jurisdiction in which the Group is incorporated or
conducts operations and, so far as the Management Warrantors are aware, no
such communication or request is currently expected.

 



 

17.6 Save as Disclosed in the Reports, no Group Company has during the last
five (5) years given, nor is considering giving, any commitment, undertaking,
assurance or similar to any national competition authority or the European
Commission or any other person, body, agency or court in connection with the
application of any Antitrust Laws.

 



 

17.7 Save as Disclosed in the Reports, no Group Company is or has during the
last five (5) years been subject to any actual or potential restriction in its
conduct as a result of any decision, judgment, order or announcement or
similar issued or adopted by any person, body, agency or court or following
any mediation or arbitration proceedings in connection with the application of
any Antitrust Laws.

 



 

17.8 Before the entry by any Group Company into any acquisition or joint
venture during the last six (6) years, the Group has sought legal advice as to
whether a merger notification was necessary in any jurisdiction and acted on
this legal advice to the extent required, and subsequently the Group has not
received any written notification from any national competition authority or
the European Commission or any other person, body, agency or court, in
connection with the application of any Antitrust Laws, which alleges that any
previous acquisitions by or joint ventures entered into by any Group Company
in any such case undertaken in the six (6) years prior to the date of this
Deed may be in breach of any relevant Antitrust Laws.

 



 

17.9 Save as Disclosed in the Reports, no Group Company has received any
material state aid, rebates or other benefits or has any outstanding material
obligations under the terms of any such state aid including any such state aid
previously granted, and no Group Company has received any information or
notice requiring that any such amounts granted in aid are due to be reduced or
repaid.

 



 

 **18.** **Taxation**

 



 

18.1 No Group Company has, or has received any written notice or indication
that any Group Company has, been involved in any scheme, arrangement,
transaction or series of

 



      
 

 



 

transactions in which the main purpose or one of the main purposes was the
evasion or avoidance of Tax.

 



 

18.2 Each Group Company: (a) is solely resident for Tax purposes in its
respective jurisdiction of incorporation and is duly registered for all Taxes
the registration for which is required by law and (b) does not and has not had
any permanent establishment or taxable presence outside the jurisdiction of
its incorporation.

 



 

18.3 No Group Company has received any notice from any Tax Authority that
requires or will require it to withhold Taxation from any payment made since
the Locked Box Date or which will or may be made after the date of this Deed.

 



 

18.4 All returns (including any land transaction returns) required to be
submitted, all notices, reports, accounts, computations, statements,
assessments, claims, disclaimers, elections and registrations and information
required to be supplied and payments required to be made by each Group Company
in each case for the purposes of Taxation (" **Returns** ") within the last
(3) three years prior to the date of this Deed have been submitted, supplied
or made punctually and within applicable time limits on a proper basis, all
such returns, information, notices and payments were complete and correct and
there is not, and there is not likely to be, any dispute or enquiry in respect
of any of them for any other reason with any Taxation Authority.

 



 

18.5 Each Group Company has paid by the relevant due date all Taxation which
it is or has been liable to pay in the three (3) years prior to the date of
this Deed and no Group Company is, or has been within the three (3) years
prior to the date of this Deed, liable to, and there are no circumstances
existing at Completion which may result in a liability to, pay any penalty,
fine, surcharge or interest in connection with such Taxation.

 



 

18.6 All Taxation that is required by law to have been deducted from any
payments made within the three (3) years prior to the date of this Deed by any
Group Company has been so deducted and all amounts due in respect thereof to
be paid to the relevant Taxation Authority on or before the date of this Deed
have been paid by the relevant due date.

 



 

18.7 The Data Room contains true, complete and accurate particulars of any
instalments of corporation tax paid by, or apportioned to, each Group Company
for the accounting period beginning immediately after the Accounts Date and
the basis for calculating such instalments (including the basis upon which the
total corporation tax liability for the accounting period was estimated).

 



 

18.8 The Locked Box Accounts make proper provision or reserve in accordance
with GAAP for all Taxation for which the Group is accountable and, where such
provision would be required by generally accepted accounting principles,
deferred tax.

 



 

18.9 So far as the Management Warrantors are aware, no Group Company is liable
to make to any person (including any Taxation Authority) any payment in
respect of any liability to Taxation which is primarily or directly chargeable
against, or attributable to, any other person (other than another Group
Company).

 



 

18.10 So far as the Management Warrantors are aware, neither the execution nor
completion of the Share Purchase Agreement, nor any other event since the
Accounts Date, will result in a charge to Tax arising in any Group Company
(otherwise than within the ordinary course of business of the relevant Group
Company) or the withdrawal, clawback or disallowance of any relief from Tax
which was either claimed prior to the date of this Deed or which has been
taken into account in the Locked Box Balance Sheet.

 



 

18.11 All transactions or arrangement made by the Group Companies (whether as
between themselves or between a Group Company and any member of the
Institutional Sellers

 



      
 

 



 

Group or other third party) have been made on arms length terms and the
processes by which prices and terms have been arrived at have, in each case,
been fully documented. No notice, enquiry or adjustments have been made by any
Tax Authority in connection with any such transactions.

 



 

18.12 So far as the Management Warrantors are aware, there is no Tax Lien,
whether imposed by any state, local or foreign Taxation Authority, outstanding
against any of the assets or properties of any of the Group Companies.

 



 

18.13 Each Group Company has prepared, kept and preserved sufficient and
accurate records to enable it to make and complete true and accurate Returns
for Taxation purposes relating to accounting periods ended within the four (4)
years prior to the date of this Deed and otherwise as required by law, and
which comply with any computerised accounting system obligations prescribed by
law.

 



 

18.14 No employee or director or former employee or director (excluding the
Management Warrantors in respect of the relevant Shares) of a Group Company or
any person associated with any of them holds or has within the last three (3)
years held any shares or securities or options over or interests in any shares
or securities of any Group Company.

 



 

18.15 No payments or loans have been made to, nor other benefit provided to,
nor any assets made available or transferred to any employee or former
employee (or any associate of such employee or former employee) of any Group
Company by an employee benefit trust or other third party as a result of such
persons (or their associates) employment with a Group Company and there are
not and have not been within the last three (3) years any arrangements entered
into for any such purposes.

 



 

18.16 Neither the sale of the Shares to the Purchaser pursuant to the Sale and
Purchase Agreement, nor the receipt of, or entitlement to, any Share
Consideration will give rise to or result in any obligation of the Purchaser,
any Group Company and/or any member of the Purchasers Group to withhold,
deduct or account for any amounts as a result of the employment status of the
relevant Seller including, but without limitation to, in respect of income
tax, payroll taxes or social security contributions.

 



 

18.17 The Data Room contains details so far as they affect any member of the
Group of all arrangements with any Taxation Authority that are not based on a
strict application of the law relating to Taxation (other than published
extra-statutory concessions, statements of practice and statements of a
similar nature). Each Group Company has complied with all requirements imposed
in respect of any such arrangement.

 



 

18.18 No Group Company has in the last three (3) years made a mandatory
disclosure to a Tax Authority in respect of a transaction or a proposed
transaction which enables any person to obtain a Tax advantage and, so far as
the Management Warrantors are aware, no circumstances exist as at the date of
this Deed which mean that a Group Company should have made such a disclosure
but failed to do so.

 



 

18.19 The Data Room contains full particulars of:

 



 

(d) all groups and consolidated groups for Taxation purposes (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, in respect of VAT) and fiscal unities of which each
Group Company is, or has been, a member within the last three (3) years
including with any of the Sellers or any member of the Institutional Sellers
Group;

 



 

(e) every agreement relating to the use of a group Tax Relief to which a Group
Company is, or has been, a party within the last three (3) years; and

 



      
 

 



 

(f) any arrangements for the payment of group Taxation liabilities to which a
Group Company has been party within the last three (3) years.

 



 

18.20 Each Group Company that is, or has throughout the whole of the period
beginning three (3) years before the Accounts Date and ending on the date
hereof been, required to be registered for VAT in any jurisdiction is so, or
has been, registered within that jurisdiction as required. No Group Company is
or has been registered, or required to be registered, for VAT in any
jurisdiction other than its jurisdiction of incorporation.

 



 

18.21 In the three (3) years prior to the date of this Deed, each Group
Company has complied in all material respects with any VAT legislation
(including in respect of the operation of capital goods schemes or equivalent
in any jurisdiction).

 



 

18.22 All supplies made by each Group Company are taxable supplies for VAT
purposes where the relevant Group Company is located or registered in a
jurisdiction that applies VAT. All input VAT incurred by each Group Company is
and has been in the period of three (3) years prior to Completion fully
recoverable and there are no circumstances existing at Completion that may
cause any input VAT incurred prior to Completion to be other than fully
recoverable.

 



 

18.23 So far as the Management Warrantors are aware, there is no instrument to
which any Group Company is a party and which is necessary to establish any
Group Companys title to any asset, which is liable to stamp duty or any
transfer tax or duty and which has not been duly stamped.

 



 

18.24 No Group Company has been a party to any transaction involving a claim
to or filing with a Tax Authority for an exemption from stamp duty or stamp
duty land tax within the three (3) years prior to the date of this Deed.

 



 

18.25 No rents, interest, annual payments, pension contributions or any sums
of an income nature, paid by the Company in three (3) years prior to
Completion have been wholly or partially disallowable as deductions,
management expenses or charges in computing taxable profits for Tax purposes.
So far as the Management Warrantors are aware, no such sums which the Company
is under an existing obligation to pay in the future will be disallowable and
there are no circumstances existing at Completion which may result in amounts
previously treated as being allowable being disallowed.

 



 

 **19**. **Insurance**

 



 

19.1 The Data Room contains an accurate list of each material insurance policy
maintained by or covering a Group Company (together, the " **Policies** ").
All premiums on the Policies have been duly and punctually paid and each of
the Policies is enforceable and is not void or voidable. As far as the
Management Warrantors are aware, there are no circumstances which might make
any of the Policies void or voidable or enable any insurer to refuse payment
of all or part of any claim under the Policies.

 



 

19.2 Each Group Company has at all times in the three (3) years prior to the
date of this Deed effected all insurance required by law and under its
contractual operations.

 



 

19.3 In the last three (3) years before the date of this Deed, no claim in
excess of SEK2,800,000 (or its equivalent) has been made or is outstanding
under any of the Policies and no matter exists which might give rise to a
claim under any of the Policies exceeding SEK2,800,000.

 



 

 **20.** **Reports**

 



 

20.1 Each Warrantor has read the executive summaries of the Reports and
confirms that: (i) each such executive summary of the Reports is accurate in
all material respects as at the date of such Reports; and (ii) there is no
material matter, fact or circumstance which

 



      
 

 



 

relates to the Group or the business of the Group included in any such
executive summary of a Report the inclusion of which might in his reasonable
opinion render such executive summary of a Report misleading in any material
respect.

 



 

20.2 Each of Jan Bernhardsson and Lars Nilsson has read the Reports (with the
exception of the Schedules of the Legal Report) and confirms that there is no
material matter, fact or circumstance which relates to the Group or business
of the Group, the inclusion of which might in his reasonable opinion render
the Reports misleading in any material respect.

 



 

 **21.** **Environmental Matters**

 



 

21.1 Each Group Company is in compliance with Environmental Laws applicable to
it in all material respects.

 



 

21.2 There are no claims, proceedings, actions or investigations against any
Group Company with respect to any material non-compliance with, or any
liability (whether actual or prospective), obligation or duty under,
Environmental Laws nor has any written notice been received threatening any
such claims, proceedings, actions or investigations.

 



 

21.3 To the knowledge and belief of the Management Warrantors, there are no
facts or circumstances which might reasonably be expected to result in
liabilities of greater than SEK5,500,000 arising directly or indirectly for
the Group from Environmental Matters at any Property in the six (6) months
after Completion.

 



       
 

 



 

 **Schedule 3**

 



 

 **Limitations on Liability**

 



 

 **1.** **Maximum Liability**

 



 

The aggregate liability of each Management Warrantor in respect of all Claims
(including all legal and other professional fees and expenses payable by the
Management Warrantor in respect of all such Claims) shall not exceed the lower
of:

 



 

 **1.1** the proportion of the liability under the Claims which is equal to
the proportion which the Management Warrantors Relevant Proportion bears to
the aggregate Relevant Proportions of those Management Warrantors liable
(including the Relevant Proportion of a Management Warrantor who is not
pursued for his Relevant Proportion of such liability but who would be liable
if so pursued) in respect of such Claims; or

 



 

 **1.2** the amount set out next to the relevant Management Warrantor in
column 3 of the Management Warrantors Allocation.

 



 

 **2.** **Time Limitation for Claims**

 



 

 **2.1** No Management Warrantor shall be liable in respect of any Claim
unless written notice specifying (in reasonable detail) the matter(s) which
gives rise to the Claim, the nature of the claim and (if practicable) a bona
fide estimate of the amount claimed in respect thereof is given by or on
behalf of the Purchaser to the Management Warrantors as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Purchaser becomes aware of the Claim and in any event by
not later than 5.00 p.m. on the date falling twelve (12) months after the date
of this deed (provided that any failure to provide any such details of the
Claim or to indicate its nature or to provide an estimate of the amount of any
such claims shall not invalidate such Claim).

 



 

 **2.2** Any Claim notified pursuant to paragraph 2.1 shall (if not previously
satisfied, settled or withdrawn) be deemed to have been withdrawn and shall
determine absolutely unless legal proceedings in respect of it have been
properly issued and validly served within nine (9) months of such written
notice being given to the Management Warrantors or, in the case of any
contingent liability, within twelve (12) months after such contingent
liability becomes an actual liability.

 



 

 **3.** **Minimum Claims**

 



 

 **3.1** The Management Warrantors shall not be liable in respect of any
individual Claim (or a series of Claims arising from substantially identical
facts, matters or circumstances) unless the liability in respect of any such
Claim (or series of claims) exceeds SEK 5,750,000 (the " **De Minimis Claim
Amount** "). Where the liability agreed or determined exceeds the De Minimis
Claim Amount, subject as otherwise provided in this deed, the Management
Warrantors shall be liable for the full amount of the Claims or series of
Claims and not just the excess.

 



 

 **3.2** The Management Warrantors shall not be liable in respect of any Claim
unless and until the aggregate amount that would otherwise be recoverable from
the Management Warrantors in respect of all Claims (but for this paragraph and
after giving due effect to paragraph 3.1 above in relation to any individual
Claim) exceeds SEK 27,000,000 (the " **Basket Amount** "). Where the aggregate
amount agreed or determined in respect of all Claims referred to in this
paragraph above exceeds the Basket Amount, subject to otherwise provided in
this deed, the relevant Management Warrantors shall be liable for the full
amount of such Claims and not just the excess.

 



      
 

 



 

 **4.** **Contingent Liabilities**

 



 

Without prejudice to the Purchasers ability to give notice of a Claim within
the time period set out in Clause 2.1, the Management Warrantors shall not be
liable in respect of any Claim which is contingent unless and until such
contingent liability becomes an actual liability and is due and payable.

 



 

 **5.** **Insurance and Other Compensation**

 



 

The Management Warrantors shall not be liable in respect of any Claim to the
extent that:

 



 

 **5.1** losses in respect of such Claim are actually recovered under a policy
of insurance of the Group; or

 



 

 **5.2** loss or damage giving rise to such Claim has been made or is made
good or is otherwise compensated for without cost to the Purchasers Group or
the Group.

 



 

 **6.** **Provisions**

 



 

The Management Warrantors shall not be liable in respect of any Claim if and
to the extent that specific allowance, provision or reserve in respect of the
matter giving rise to the Claim is made in the Locked Box Accounts provided
that any such limitation shall only apply to the extent of such specific
allowance, provision or reserve.

 



 

 **7.** **Acts of the Purchaser**

 



 

The Management Warrantors shall not be liable in respect of any Claim to the
extent it would not have occurred but for, or has been increased as a result
of:

 



 

 **7.1** any act, omission or transaction of the Purchasers Group after
Completion, otherwise than in the ordinary course of business conducted by the
Group as per the date of Completion (save that this exclusion shall not apply
where such act, omission or transaction was carried out or effected by the
Purchaser or any member of the Purchasers Group (or its or their respective
directors or employees or agents or successors in title or any of its
Affiliates) pursuant to a legally binding commitment of the Group created on
or before Completion or at the written direction or written request of any of
the Management Warrantors or to comply with Applicable Law); or

 



 

 **7.2** any change in the accounting principles or practices of the Group
(including the length of any accounting period for tax purposes) introduced
after Completion save to the extent such change is required to comply with
GAAP.

 



 

 **8.** **Changes in law**

 



 

The Management Warrantors shall not be liable in respect of any Claim to the
extent that matters, facts or circumstances giving rise to the Claim would not
have occurred but for:

 



 

 **8.1** any change in law or regulation or in its interpretation or
administration by the English courts, by a Taxation Authority or by any other
fiscal monetary or regulatory authority after the date hereof; or

 



 

 **8.2** any increase in the rates of taxation made after the date hereof.

 



 

 **9.** **Mitigation of Losses**

 



 

The Purchaser shall procure that all reasonable steps are taken and all
reasonable assistance is given to avoid or mitigate any losses arising as a
result of the subject matter of a Claim.

 



      
 

 



 

 **10.** **Fraud**

 



 

None of the limitations contained in this Schedule 3 shall apply to any claim
which arises or is increased, or to the extent to which it arises or is
increased, as the consequence of, or which is delayed as a result of, fraud by
any Management Warrantor.

 



 

 **11.** **Warranty and Indemnity Insurance**

 



 

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this deed:

 



 

 **11.1** the parties acknowledge that, the Purchaser has secured a policy of
insurance for the benefit of the Purchaser and/or the Purchasers Group
(including, after Completion, the Group) to cover Losses arising in respect of
breaches of and claims under the Warranties (the " **Warranty and Indemnity
Insurance** ");

 



 

 **11.2** the Purchaser agrees and undertakes that the Warranty and Indemnity
Insurance shall contain a waiver from the WandI Insurer waiving all its rights
to take subrogated action or to exercise rights assigned to it against the
Management Warrantors in relation to any Claim, other than in the event of
fraud or dishonest misconduct by the Management Warrantors;

 



 

 **11.3** the Purchaser:

 



 

(a) shall not agree to any amendment, variation or waiver of the waiver
referred to in paragraph 11.2 (or do anything which has a similar effect)
without the prior written consent of the Management Warrantors;

 



 

(b) shall not novate, or otherwise assign its respective rights with respect
to the waiver referred to in paragraph 11.2 (or do anything which has similar
effect) or do anything which causes the waiver referred to in Clause 11.2 not
to have full force and effect in accordance with its terms; and

 



 

(c) shall, without limitation to any right of the Management Warrantors to
separately enforce such terms, use all reasonable endeavours to enforce any
term in the Warranty and Indemnity Insurance under which the WandI Insurer
waives its rights to take subrogated action against the Management Warrantors
upon the terms set out in the Warranty and Indemnity Insurance.

claims, costs, expenses, demands, actions, proceedings, investigations,

have otherwise arisen;

 



 

5.1.3 to the extent that the liability involves the disallowance, loss,
clawback, reduction, restriction, modification or non-availability of any
Accounts Relief (other than a right to a repayment of Tax) the amount of Tax

been used by a Group Company in the period current at Completion (assuming

5.1.4 to the extent that the liability involves the disallowance or reduction
by any Tax Authority of a right to a repayment of Tax, the amount of the

Business Day prior to the date or dates referred to in Clause 6.1.1(a) or
6.1.1(b) that would have applied to the Tax satisfied, avoided or reduced by
