 MERGER

  

2.1   _The Integrated Mergers_.

  

(a) Under the terms of this Agreement and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7, at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Stewardship in
accordance with the provisions of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act ( "
_NJBCA_ ") (" _First-Step Merger_ "). Stewardship shall be the surviving
corporation in the First-Step Merger, and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of New Jersey. Upon consummation of the
First-Step Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
terminate. On or before the date that the First-Step Merger is consummated
(the _" Closing Date"_), Columbia and Stewardship, respectively, shall cause
to be filed a certificate of merger with the Department of the Treasury of
the State of New Jersey (the " _New Jersey Department of the Treasury_ ") in
accordance with the NJBCA (the " _First-Step Merger Certificate_ "). The
First-Step Merger shall become effective as of the date the and time
specified in the First-Step Merger Certificate (such date and time, the "
_Effective Time_ ").

  

(b) Immediately following the Effective Time, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") and the NJBCA, Stewardship, as the surviving
corporation in the First-Step Merger, shall merge with and into Columbia.
Columbia shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Second-Step Merger, and
shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Upon consummation of the Second-Step Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Stewardship shall terminate. On or before the Closing Date,
Columbia and Stewardship, respectively, shall cause to be filed a certificate
of ownership and merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in accordance with the DGCL and a certificate of merger with the New Jersey
Department of the Treasury in accordance with the NJBCA (collectively, the "
_Second-Step Merger Certificates_ "). The Second-Step Merger shall become
effective as of the date and time specified in the Second-Step Merger
Certificates.

  

2.2   _Effects of the Integrated Mergers_. At and after the
Effective Time, the First-Step Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
NJBCA. At and after the effective time of the Second-Step Merger, the Second-
Step Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL and
the NJBCA.

  

2.3   _Effects of First-Step Merger on Merger Sub Capital Stock_.
At and after the Effective Time, each share of the capital stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of Stewardship.

  

2.4   _Conversion of Stewardship Common Stock in the First-Step
Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First-Step Merger and
without any action on the part of Columbia, Merger Sub or Stewardship or the
holder of Stewardship Common Stock, subject to Section 2.9, each issued and
outstanding share of Stewardship Common Stock (other than shares to be
canceled pursuant to this Section 2.4) will be canceled and extinguished and
be converted into and become a right to receive from Columbia $15.75 in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Each share of Stewardship
Common Stock held as treasury stock of Stewardship or held directly or
indirectly by Columbia, other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in
satisfaction of Indebtedness previously contracted, will be canceled, retired
and cease to exist, and no exchange or payment will be made with respect
thereto.

--- 

 


--- 

    

  

2.5   _Effects of Second-Step Merger on Columbia and Stewardship
Common Stock_. At the effective time of the Second-Step Merger, each share of
(a) Columbia common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such
time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the
Second-Step Merger and (b) Stewardship Common Stock, as the surviving
corporation in the First-Step Merger, issued and outstanding immediately prior
to such time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and neither the
Merger Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

  

2.6   _Certificate of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation_. At
the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Stewardship, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger until such
Certificate of Incorporation is thereafter amended in accordance with its
terms and applicable law. At the effective time of the Second-Step Merger, the
Certificate of Incorporation of Columbia, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms
and applicable law.

  

2.7   _Bylaws of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time,
the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Bylaws of the surviving corporation in the First-
Step Merger until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and
applicable law. At the effective time of the Second-Step Merger, the Bylaws
of Columbia, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with their terms and applicable law.

  

2.8   _Directors; Officers_. At and immediately after the
Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub in office
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers
of the surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. Subject to Section
6.9, the directors and officers of Columbia in office immediately prior to the
effective time of the Second-Step Merger shall be the directors and officers
of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified.

  

2.9   _Payment and Exchange of Certificates_.

  

(a)   _Appointment of Paying Agent; Payment of Merger
Consideration; Exchange of Certificates_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Columbia shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a third party
paying agent mutually satisfactory to Columbia and Stewardship (the " _Paying
Agent_ "), pursuant to an agreement entered into between Columbia and the
Paying Agent prior to Closing, for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Stewardship Common Stock ("Stewardship Converted Common Stock"), an amount of
cash equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration. As promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time but in no event later than five (5) Business Days
after the Closing, Columbia will cause to be distributed to each holder of
Stewardship Converted Common Shares, of a letter of transmittal or other
appropriate materials to facilitate the surrender of
certificates representing such shares or any statement reflecting shares
issued in book entry form, which prior to the Effective Time represented a
share of Stewardship Common Stock (a "Certificate" or "Certificates" which is
intended to refer to ownership of book entry accounts as well), in exchange
for Merger Consideration for each Stewardship Converted Common Share (a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "). As promptly as practicable but in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days after surrender to the Paying Agent of any
Certificate, Columbia will cause the Paying Agent to distribute to the Person
in whose name such Certificate is registered, the Merger Consideration.

   

11 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(b)   _Failure to Surrender Certificates_. If outstanding
Certificates formerly representing Stewardship Common Stock are not
surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration to which any
holder of such shares is entitled as a result of the Merger would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, the unclaimed
Merger Consideration will, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and
any other applicable Law, become the property of Columbia (and to the extent
not in Columbia's possession will be paid over to Columbia), free and clear of
any and all claims or interest of any Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Columbia nor any other Person will be liable to any holder of
Stewardship Converted Common Shares for any amount delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws.

  

(c)   _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any stock
certificate representing Stewardship Converted Common Shares will have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, Columbia will issue and pay in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof in form satisfactory to the Paying Agent, the
Merger Consideration for each Stewardship Converted Common Share; _provided,
however_ , that Columbia or the Paying Agent may, as a condition precedent to
the issuance and payment of the Merger Consideration to which the holder of
such certificate is entitled as a result of the Merger, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate to deliver a bond in such customary
form and amount as Columbia or the Paying Agent may reasonably require as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Columbia, Stewardship or
any other party with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

  

(d)   _Full Satisfaction_. The Merger Consideration issued and
paid upon the surrender for exchange of each Stewardship Converted Common
Share in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be
deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Stewardship Converted Common Share.

  

2.10   _Stewardship Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each
award in respect of a share of Stewardship Common Stock subject to vesting,
repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a Plan that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Stewardship
Restricted Stock Award_ ") will fully vest and will be converted into the
right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant
to Section 2.4. Stewardship will deliver stock certificates representing the
shares of Stewardship Common Stock that are subject to vested Stewardship
Restricted Stock Awards simultaneously with the Effective Time. Payment of
the Merger Consideration to holders of such shares will be governed by
Section 2.9(a); _provided, however,_ that Columbia will be entitled to deduct
and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the
Merger Consideration payable in respect to Stewardship Restricted Stock Awards
all such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or
any provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law.

Plan_. With respect to Stewardship's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_ESPP_ ") and Stewardship Director Stock Plan (" _DSP_ ") the Board of
Directors of Stewardship will adopt resolutions or take other actions as may
be required to (i) cause the exercise (as of no later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs) of any outstanding
purchase right pursuant to the ESPP and DSP, (ii) provide that no further
purchase periods or purchase rights will be available under the ESPP or DSP
from and following ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement
or in accordance with any notice periods required under the ESPP or DSP, as
applicable, and (iii) terminate the ESPP and DSP (with such termination
effective prior to the Effective Time).

  

2.12   _The Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take place as soon as practicable
once the conditions in Article 7 have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) but in any event
within 10 Business Days after the date on which all such conditions have
been satisfied or waived, unless the parties otherwise agree (the " _Closing
Date_ ") by electronic exchange of documents and signatures; _provided_ ,
that if Columbia and Stewardship mutually agree to a physical closing, the
Closing shall take place at the offices of Columbia, located at 19-01 Route
208 North, Fair Lawn, NJ 07410, or at a location otherwise agreed upon by
Columbia and Stewardship. The failure of the Closing will not _ipso facto _
result in termination of this Agreement and will not relieve any party of any
obligation under this Agreement.

Closing Date, Stewardship will deliver to Columbia:

provisions of all Laws relating to Taxes (including the Code). To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Stewardship Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

revise the structure of the Merger in order to achieve tax benefits or for
any other reason, including for its internal accounting purposes, which
Columbia may deem advisable; provided, however, that Columbia shall not have
the right, without the approval of the Board of Directors of Stewardship and,
if and to the extent required by applicable law, the holders of Stewardship
Common Stock, to make any revision that (i) would change the amount or type
of the Merger Consideration to which the holders of shares of
Stewardship Common Stock are entitled (as determined in the manner provided
in Sections 2.4 and 2.10), (ii) would materially delay or jeopardize receipt
of the approval of the Merger by any Regulatory Authority, or (iii) could
reasonably be expected to adversely impact the tax consequences arising from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to any holders of Stewardship
Common Stock. Columbia may exercise this right of revision by giving written
notice to Stewardship in the manner provided in Section 9.2 of this
Agreement, which notice shall include a form of an amendment to this

which, in either case, shall not be required to be executed by any of the

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Except with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Columbia and Columbia Bank has
conducted its respective business only in the Ordinary Course of Business.

(a)  Columbia and each of its Subsidiaries are, and at all
times since January 1, 2015 have been, in compliance with all Laws,

to so comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Columbia.

  

(b)  Since January 1, 2015, each of Columbia and its
Subsidiaries has held all Governmental Authorizations required for the
conduct of its business, except where the failure to hold any such
Governmental Authorization would not have a Material Adverse Effect on

or is subject to any Governmental Order, written agreement or memorandum of
understanding with, or a commitment letter or similar submission to, or
extraordinary supervisory letter from any Bank Regulator, nor has Columbia or
any of its Subsidiaries adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions

(d)  No Governmental Entity has initiated since January 1, 2015
or currently has pending any proceeding or enforcement action against
Columbia or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(e) Since January 1, 2015, neither Columbia nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been advised of, and has no reason to believe that, any
facts or circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to cause
Columbia or any of its Subsidiaries to be deemed to be operating in material
violation of any provision of the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of
2001 or any Governmental Order issued with respect to anti-money laundering
by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or
any other applicable anti-money laundering Law or Governmental Order issued
with respect to economic sanctions programs by the U.S. Department of the
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.

  

3.6   _Regulatory Approvals_. As of the date hereof, Columbia is
not aware of any fact or circumstance relating to it or any of its
Subsidiaries that would materially impede or delay receipt of any Bank
Regulatory Approvals or that would likely result in the Bank Regulatory
Approvals not being obtained. Neither Columbia nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any Governmental Order, written agreement or memorandum of
understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar
undertaking to, or is a recipient of any extraordinary supervisory
agreement letter from, or has adopted any board resolutions at the request
of, any Governmental Entity that would reasonably be expected to, impair the
ability of Columbia to obtain the Bank Regulatory Approvals in a timely
fashion or to operate Stewardship Bank in the Ordinary Course of Business
after the Merger. Columbia has not received any indication from any
Governmental Entity that such Governmental Entity would oppose or refuse to
grant or issue its consent or approval, if required, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and has no reason to believe that, if
requested, any Governmental Entity required to approve the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement would oppose or fail to grant its consent or
approval to such transactions.

Columbia or its Subsidiaries may be liable or to which any of their
respective properties or assets may be subject, before or by any Governmental
Entity, that (i) would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Columbia or Columbia Bank or (ii) in any manner challenges or seeks
to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

3.8   _Community Reinvestment Act_. Each Subsidiary of Columbia
that is an insured depository institution had a rating of "satisfactory" or
better as of its most recent CRA examination, and no such Subsidiary has been
advised of, and has no reason to believe that, any facts or circumstances
exist that would reasonably be expected to cause such Subsidiary to be deemed
not to be in satisfactory compliance in any respect with the CRA or to be
assigned a rating for CRA purposes by any Governmental Entity charged with the
supervision or regulation of banks or bank holding companies or engaged in
the insurance of bank deposits (collectively, " _Bank Regulators_ ") of lower
than "satisfactory."

  

3.9   _Financing_. Columbia has, and, on the Closing Date will

of the related security interests, mortgages and other liens comply in all
material respects with all applicable Laws (including Laws relating to
the extension of credit).

  

(b)  Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.7(b)_ , there are no
loans, leases, other extensions of credit or commitments to extend credit of

the outstanding principal balance of the related loan, the amount of the
outstanding balance represented by the Loan Participation and the identity of
the borrower of the related loan.

  

4.8   _Allowance for Loan Losses_. The allowance for loan losses
_( "ALLL"_) is, and will be as of the Effective Time, in compliance with
Stewardship Bank's existing methodology for determining the adequacy of the
ALLL, as well as the standards established by applicable
Governmental Entities and the Financial Accounting Standards Board and is and
will be adequate under all standards. Neither Stewardship nor Stewardship
Bank has been notified by any Governmental Entity or by Stewardship's or
Stewardship Bank's independent auditor, in writing or otherwise, that: (a)
such allowances are inadequate; (b) the practices and policies of
Stewardship or Stewardship Bank in establishing such allowances and in

are inadequate or inconsistent with the historical loss experience of
Stewardship or Stewardship Bank.

or is subject to any Encumbrance, legal restraint or other legal process
(other than garnishments, pledges, set-off rights, escrow limitations and
similar actions taken in the Ordinary Course of Business). All of the deposit
accounts of Stewardship Bank are insured up to the applicable limits (or fully
insured if there is no limit) through the Deposit Insurance Fund as

the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, and all premiums and
assessments required to be paid for such insurance have been paid when due.
No legal action or proceeding for the termination or revocation of such
insurance is pending, or, to the Knowledge of Stewardship, has any such
termination or revocation been threatened.

and the NJDOBI (including quarterly Consolidated Reports of Condition and
Income filed by Stewardship Bank (the " _Stewardship Bank Call Reports_ "))
(such reports and filings, together with all exhibits thereto, the "
_Stewardship Regulatory Reports_ "), except for such reports and filings
which the failure to so file would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Stewardship or on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Stewardship has provided or made available to Columbia copies of
all of the Stewardship Regulatory Reports that it may provide consistent with
applicable Law. As of their respective dates or as subsequently amended prior
to the date hereof, each of the Stewardship Regulatory Reports was true and

Certain Statutory Trust Securities; Off Balance Sheet Arrangements_.

interests, as applicable, in each Stewardship Bank Subsidiary. Except as set
forth on Schedule 4.11(a), and except for the Stewardship Bank Common Stock
owned by Stewardship, none of the Stewardship Entities owns any stock,
limited liability company membership units, partnership interests or any
other equity security issued by any Person, except securities owned by
Stewardship Bank in the Ordinary Course of Business.

of, any joint venture, off balance sheet limited liability company, off
balance sheet partnership or any similar off balance sheet entity, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933 (the " _Securities Act_ ")),
where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or of any material
Liabilities of, any Stewardship Entities.

and correct in all material respects and have been maintained in accordance
with sound business practices. Each transaction is properly and accurately
recorded on the books and records of each Stewardship Entity, and each
document upon which entries in books and records of each Stewardship Entity
are based is complete and accurate in all material respects.

control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance
with GAAP, including reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are executed
in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations and
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability, and (B) regarding
prevention or timely detection of any unauthorized acquisition, use or

(b) Since January 1, 2015, neither Stewardship nor Stewardship
Bank has been advised of, and has no reason to believe that, any facts or

Stewardship Bank to be deemed to be operating in material violation of any
provision of the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 or any
Governmental Order issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S.
Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other

Office of Foreign Assets Control.

  

(c) Since January 1, 2015, each of the Stewardship Entities has

respective properties is a party to or is subject to any Governmental Order,
directive, agreement, memorandum of understanding or similar arrangement with,
or a commitment letter or similar submission to, or extraordinary supervisory

suggestion of, any Bank Regulator. Stewardship and Stewardship Bank have
paid all assessments made or imposed by any Bank Regulator.

  

(e) Neither Stewardship nor Stewardship Bank has been advised by,
nor does it have any knowledge of facts which could give rise to an advisory
notice by, any Regulatory Authority that such Regulatory Authority is
contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of
issuing or requesting) any Governmental Order, directive, agreement,
memorandum of understanding, commitment letter, supervisory letter or similar
submission or any request for the adoption of any policy, procedure or
board resolution.

  

(f) (i) No Governmental Entity has initiated since December 31,
2015 or has pending any proceeding, enforcement action or, to the Knowledge

foregoing, and (ii) there is no material unresolved violation with respect to
any report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections of

or regulated by the SEC thereunder.

(h)  Stewardship Bank is "well-capitalized," as such term is
defined in the rules and regulations promulgated by the FRB.

  

4.29   _Fiduciary Accounts_. None of the Stewardship Entities acts as
a fiduciary for any customer or account (including acting as a trustee,

management agreements and arrangements.

  

(b) All interest rate swaps, caps, floors and option agreements
and other interest rate risk management arrangements to which Stewardship or

accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable rules, regulations and
policies of Bank Regulators and with counterparties believed to be
financially responsible at the time, and are legal, valid and binding
obligations enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be
limited by Remedies Exceptions), and are in full force and effect. Each of
Stewardship and Stewardship Bank has duly performed in all material respects
all of its obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to
perform have accrued; and, to the Knowledge of Stewardship, there are no
breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any
party thereunder.

  

4.31   _No Guarantees_. No Liability of any Stewardship Entity is
guaranteed by any other Person, nor has any Stewardship Entity guaranteed the
Liabilities of any other Person.

  

4.32   _Regulatory Approvals_. To the Knowledge of Stewardship, there
is no fact or circumstance relating to it or Stewardship Bank that would
materially impede or delay receipt of any Bank Regulatory Approvals or that
would likely result in the Bank Regulatory Approvals not being obtained.

Sandler O'Neill addressed to the Board of Directors of Stewardship to the

accordance with Article 8, Stewardship will permit and will cause Stewardship

of Stewardship set forth herein, and (ii) Stewardship will be permitted to
keep confidential any information relating to legal matters, regulatory

reasonably believes is subject to legal privilege or other legal protection
that would be compromised by disclosure to Columbia. In addition, Stewardship

Stewardship Entities to be reasonably available for, and respond to any
questions of, such Columbia representatives during reasonable business hours
and upon reasonable prior notice by Columbia to such individuals, and to
cooperate fully with Columbia in planning for the integration of the

(b) Any confidential information or trade secrets of each of the
Stewardship Entities received by Columbia, or its Representatives in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby will

5.4   _Notice of Developments_. During the period from the date
of this Agreement through the earlier of the Effective Time and the

permitted by Law, Stewardship and Columbia will promptly notify the other
party of any event that is reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on, or any other change in the Ordinary Course of Business of,
any Stewardship Entity or Columbia, respectively. Stewardship and Columbia

5.5   _Consents and Authorizations_. Stewardship will use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain (at no cost to Columbia), prior to Closing,
all Consents (the " _Required Consents_ ") listed on _Schedule 5.5_.
Stewardship acknowledges and agrees that the Required Consents are all of the
Consents of Persons (other than Bank Regulators) necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Stewardship

Consents, and Columbia will reasonably cooperate with Stewardship to obtain
the Required Consents.

  

5.6   _Tax Matters_.

  

(a) Each of the Stewardship Entities, at their own expense, will
prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and timely filed) all
Returns required to be filed by the relevant Stewardship Entity on or before
the Effective Time, and timely pay all Taxes reflected thereon. All such
Returns will be correct and complete in all material respects and will be
prepared in accordance with past practices of the relevant Stewardship
Entities, to the extent such practices comply with applicable Law. No later
than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date (including extensions) for
filing any income or franchise Tax Returns referred to in the foregoing
sentence, the relevant Stewardship Entity will deliver such Returns to
Columbia for review, comment. With respect to any Returns referred to in the
first sentence of this Section 5.6(a) other than income and franchise Tax
Returns, the relevant Stewardship Entity will deliver such Returns to
Columbia no later than five (5) days prior to the due date (including
extensions) for filing such Returns and Columbia will, at its option and in
its sole discretion, have the right to review and comment with respect to
such other Returns. The relevant Stewardship Entity will consider the comments
of Columbia in good faith and will incorporate Columbia's comments in each
such Return prior to the filing thereof to the extent that Stewardship deems
necessary; _provided, however,_ that Stewardship will make any changes to
such Returns that are required to correct obvious errors or to ensure
that each Return complies with applicable Law.

  

(b) Columbia, at its own expense, will prepare and timely file (or
cause to be prepared and timely filed) all Returns of the Stewardship
Entities required to be filed after the Effective Time; _provided, however,_
that Stewardship shall accrue for the expense of filing such Returns relating
to pre-closing tax periods prior to Closing. Columbia will prepare and file
all such Returns in respect of a taxable period which ends on or prior to the
Effective Time that are not required to be filed on or before the Effective
Time, and all such Returns in respect of a taxable period which begins before
and ends after the Effective Time, consistent with past practices of the
relevant Stewardship Entities, to the extent such practices comply with
applicable Law.

   

56

--- 

    

  

(c) Stewardship will be liable for any transfer, value added,
excise, stock transfer, stamp, recording, registration and any similar Taxes
that become payable as a result of the Merger (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). The
applicable parties will cooperate in preparing and filing such forms and
documents as may be necessary to permit any such Transfer Tax to be
assessed and paid on or prior to the Effective Time in accordance with any
available pre-sale filing procedure, and to obtain any exemption from or
refund of any such Transfer Tax.

  

(d) Each of the Stewardship Entities and Columbia will cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of Returns pursuant to this Section 5.6 and in
connection with any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation will include the retention and (upon the other party's
reasonable request) the provision of records and information (including
making such records and information available for copying) which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding, the
timely provision to the other party of powers of attorney or
similar authorizations necessary to carry out the purposes of this Section
5.6, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Columbia and each of the Stewardship Entities agrees to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to any of the Stewardship
Entities relating to any taxable period which ends on or prior to the
Effective Time until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and,
to the extent notified by Columbia or its Affiliate, any extensions thereof)
of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority.

  

(e) No party to this Agreement nor any such party's Affiliates
shall make an election under Section 338 of the Code (or any comparable
provision of state or Local Law) in respect of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

5.7   _No Solicitation_.

  

(a) Neither Stewardship nor Stewardship Bank will, and they will
each use their best efforts to cause their officers, directors, employees,
agents and authorized representatives (" _Representatives_ ") not to, directly
or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate the
making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or take any
action that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) furnish any information regarding any Stewardship Entity to any Person
in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry or
indication of interest that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) except as otherwise
permitted by Section 6.3(a), approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any
Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction;
_provided, however,_ that prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Required Stewardship Shareholder Vote, this Section 5.7(a) will not prohibit
Stewardship from furnishing nonpublic information regarding the Stewardship
Entities to, or participating in discussions or negotiations with, any Person
in response to a Superior Proposal that is submitted to Stewardship by such
Person (and not withdrawn) if (1) neither Stewardship nor any other
Stewardship Entity nor any of their respective Representatives have violated
any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.7(a), (2) the Board of
Directors of Stewardship concludes in good faith, after having consulted with
and considered the advice of outside counsel to Stewardship, that failure to
take such action could reasonably be likely to result in a violation of its
fiduciary obligations to Stewardship's shareholders under applicable Law, (3)
prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into
discussions with, such Person, Stewardship gives Columbia written notice of
the identity of such Person and of Stewardship's intention to furnish
nonpublic information to such Person, and Stewardship receives from such
Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary
limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral
information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Stewardship and (4)
not later than furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person,
Stewardship furnishes such nonpublic information to Columbia (to the extent
such nonpublic information has not been previously furnished by the
Stewardship to Columbia). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Stewardship acknowledges and agrees that any violation of or the taking of any
action inconsistent with any of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by Stewardship, Stewardship Bank or any Representative will be
deemed to constitute a breach of this Section 5.7(a) by Stewardship.

   

57 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(b) Stewardship will promptly (and in no event later than twenty-
four (24) hours with respect to oral notice and no later than forty-eight
(48) hours with respect to written notice after receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information) notify Columbia of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or
indication of interest that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information relating to
Stewardship or Stewardship Bank (including the identity of the Person making
or submitting such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or
request, and the terms thereof) that is made or submitted by any Person prior
to the Closing Date. Stewardship will keep Columbia fully informed with
respect to the status of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication
of interest or request and any modification or proposed modification thereto.

  

(c) Stewardship and Stewardship Bank will immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing discussions with any Person that relate
to any Acquisition Proposal.

  

(d) Stewardship will not release or permit the release of any
Person from, or waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which Stewardship is a
party, and will enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement at the
request of Columbia.

  

5.8   _Columbia Forbearances_. Except as expressly contemplated
or permitted by this Agreement, as required by Applicable Law or at the
direction of a Governmental Entity, or with the prior written consent of
the Stewardship, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
Columbia shall not and shall cause Columbia Bank and each of their respective
Subsidiaries not to:

   

58 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(a) take any action that could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect or materially delay its ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

  

(b) amend its charter, bylaws, or other organizational or governing
documents in a manner that could materially impede Columbia's or Columbia
Bank's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

(c) take any action that is intended or could reasonably be expected
to result in (i) any of the representations or warranties of Columbia or
Columbia Bank set forth in this Agreement being or becoming untrue at any time
prior to the Effective Time or at the Effective Time, (ii) any of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 7 not being satisfied, or (iii)
a breach or violation of any provision of this Agreement; or

  

(d) agree to do, make any commitment to do, or adopt any resolutions
of its board of directors (or other governing body) in support
of, recommending, or proposing any of the foregoing.

  

5.9   _Stewardship Forbearances_. Except as expressly permitted
by this Agreement or with the prior written consent of Columbia (which will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), during the period from
the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 8, Stewardship will
not, and will not permit any other Stewardship Entity, except as may be
required by applicable Law, any Governmental Order or policies imposed by any
Governmental Entity, (a) take any action that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) take, or omit to take, any
action that is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions to the
Merger set forth in Article 7 not being or becoming not being capable of being
satisfied, or (c) take any action that would render, or that reasonably would
be expected to render, any representation or warranty made by Stewardship in
this Agreement untrue at the Closing as though then made and as though the
Closing Date had been substituted for the date of this Agreement in such
representation or warranty.

  

5.10   _Maintenance of ALLL_. Stewardship will cause Stewardship
Bank to maintain the ALLL of Stewardship Bank in compliance with GAAP and
regulatory accounting principles and Stewardship Bank's existing methodology
for determining the adequacy of the ALLL, as well as the standards established
by all applicable Governmental Entities and the Financial Accounting
Standards Board. Stewardship agrees that the ALLL of Stewardship Bank will be
adequate under all standards, and that the ALLL will be consistent with the
historical loss experience of Stewardship Bank. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Stewardship will not permit Stewardship Bank to
allow its ALLL to fall below $7,500,000 as of the Effective Time.

5.11   _Termination of Stewardship Dividend Reinvestment Plan_.
Within thirty (30) days after execution of this Agreement, Stewardship will
take the necessary corporate action to suspend or terminate the Stewardship
Dividend Reinvestment Plan and will provide the required notice of such
suspension or termination to participants in the Stewardship Dividend
Reinvestment Plan.

  

5.12   _Shareholder Litigation_. Stewardship shall provide to
Columbia the opportunity to participate in (but not control), at Columbia's
sole expense, the defense of any litigation brought by any shareholder of
Stewardship or in the name of Stewardship against Stewardship, as applicable,
and/or Stewardship's directors, officer, employees, attorneys, agents or
representatives relating to any or all of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger (" _Transaction Litigation_ ") and
further shall not compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding any
Transaction Litigation, or consent to the same, without requesting in writing
and receiving the prior written consent of Columbia which consent Columbia
agrees shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For
purposes of this Section 5.12, "participate" means that Stewardship will keep
Columbia apprised of pleadings and reasonably apprised in writing of proposed
strategy and other significant decisions with respect to any such
Transaction Litigation to the extent that the attorney-client privilege is
not undermined or otherwise affected and Columbia may offer comments or
suggestions with respect to the Transaction Litigation which Stewardship shall
be under no obligation to accept or implement. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing contained in this Section 5.12 shall be deemed to confer any measure
of control on the part of Columbia other than the reasonable consent right
contained herein.

  

ARTICLE 6 
 ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

  

6.1   _The Bank Merger_. To the extent not previously approved,

the Bank Merger Agreement and the Bank Merger within three (3) Business Days
of execution of this Agreement, and will vote all of the shares of Stewardship
Bank Common Stock held by Stewardship in favor of approval of the Bank Merger
Agreement and the Bank Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, the Bank Merger
will occur immediately after the Merger, and will be conditioned upon
regulatory approval and upon the Required Stewardship Shareholder Vote.

  

6.2   _Filings and Regulatory Approvals_. Columbia and

Jersey Banking Statute and the waiver or approval, if required, of the FRB of
the Merger under the SandL Holding Company Act and the BHC Act, and any other
applicable Governmental Entities, and Columbia will provide copies of the non-
confidential portions of such applications, filings and related
correspondence to Stewardship. Prior to filing each application or other
document with the applicable Governmental Entity, each party will provide the
other party with an opportunity to review and comment on the non-
confidential portions of each such application or other document and will
discuss with the other party which portions of this Agreement will be
designated as confidential portions of such applications. Each party will use
all reasonable best efforts and will cooperate with the other party in taking
any other actions necessary to obtain such regulatory or other approvals and
consents, including participating in any required hearings or proceedings.
Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each party will use all
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Columbia will pay, or will cause to be paid, any applicable
fees and expenses (other than those incurred by Stewardship's
outside counsel) in connection with the preparation and filing of such
regulatory filings necessary to obtain the Bank Regulatory Approvals.

6.3   _Shareholder Meeting_.

  

(a) Stewardship will call a special meeting of its shareholders
(the " _Stewardship Shareholder Meeting_ ") for the purpose of voting upon
this Agreement and the Merger, and will schedule such meeting based on
consultation with Columbia as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of
clearance from the SEC of the Proxy Statement as set forth in Section
6.3(b), but in any event shall hold the special meeting no later than sixty
(60) days after receipt of such SEC clearance . The Board of Directors of
Stewardship will recommend that the shareholders approve this Agreement and
the Merger (the " _Stewardship Board Recommendation_ "), and Stewardship will
use its best efforts (including soliciting proxies for such approval)
to obtain the Required Stewardship Shareholder Vote. The Stewardship Board
Recommendation may not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
Columbia, and no resolution by the Board of Directors of Stewardship or any
committee thereof to withdraw or modify the Stewardship Board Recommendation
in a manner adverse to Stewardship may be adopted; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the adoption of this Agreement
by the Required Stewardship Shareholder Vote, the Board of Directors of
Stewardship may withdraw, qualify or modify the Stewardship Board
Recommendation or approve, adopt, recommend or otherwise declare advisable
any Superior Proposal made after the date hereof and not solicited, initiated
or encouraged in breach of Section 5.7, if the Board of Directors of
Stewardship determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to do so would be likely to result in a breach of
fiduciary duties under applicable law (a " _Change of Stewardship Board
Recommendation_ "). In determining whether to make a Change of Stewardship
Board Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or otherwise, the
Board of Directors of Stewardship will take into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Columbia or any other information
provided by Columbia in response to such notice. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board of Directors of
Stewardship from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders, as
applicable, a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation
M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any
disclosure to its shareholders, as applicable, if the Board of Directors of
Stewardship determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the directors' duties to shareholders under, or would
violate applicable Law; or (iii) making accurate disclosure to its
shareholders, as applicable, of factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Stewardship or the fact that
an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making such
proposal or the material terms of such proposal (and such disclosure shall
not be deemed to be a Change of the Stewardship Board Recommendation), it
being understood that any "stop, look and listen" communication that contains
only the information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be deemed in and of
itself to be a Change of the Stewardship Board Recommendation.

  

(b) For the purposes of holding the Stewardship Shareholder
Meeting, within thirty (30) days after the date of execution of this
Agreement, Stewardship will prepare and file with the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act the proxy solicitation materials (the " _Proxy Statement_ ")
that, in all material respects, shall be in such form, and contain or be
accompanied by such information regarding the Stewardship Shareholder
Meeting, this Agreement, the parties hereto, the Merger and other
matters described herein, as is required by all applicable laws, rules and
regulations, and otherwise that a reasonable shareholder of Stewardship would
consider material in connection with the Stewardship Shareholder Meeting.
Stewardship will provide a copy of the proposed Proxy Statement in
preliminary form to Columbia for its review and comment prior to its being
printed and distributed to Stewardship's shareholders and will consider in
good faith any comments provided by Columbia on the proposed Proxy Statement.

   

61

(c) Columbia will furnish such information concerning Columbia
and its Subsidiaries, including Columbia Bank, as is necessary in order to
cause the Proxy Statement, insofar as it relates to Columbia and its
Subsidiaries, including Columbia Bank, to be prepared in accordance with
Section 6.3(b). Columbia agrees promptly to notify Stewardship if at any time
prior to the Stewardship Shareholder Meeting any information provided by
Columbia in the Proxy Statement becomes incorrect or incomplete in any
material respect, and to provide the information needed to correct such
inaccuracy or omission.

  

(d) None of the information relating to Columbia and its
Subsidiaries, including Columbia Bank, that is provided by Columbia for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at the time of mailing the Proxy
Statement to Stewardship's shareholders, at the time of the Stewardship
Shareholder Meeting and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

  

(e) None of the information relating to Stewardship and the
other Stewardship Entities that is included in the Proxy Statement will, at
the time of mailing the Proxy Statement to Stewardship's shareholders, at the
time of the Stewardship Shareholder Meeting and at the Effective Time,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

(f)  Stewardship will bear all printing and mailing costs in
connection with the preparation and mailing of the Proxy Statement to
Stewardship's shareholders.

  

6.4   _Employee Matters._

  

(a) Columbia shall honor the Plans set forth in Stewardship's
Disclosure Letter in accordance with the terms of such Plans, except to the
extent an alternative treatment is set forth in this _Section 6.4_. During the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date or, if shorter, during the period of
employment of a Continuing Employee following the Closing, Columbia shall
maintain or cause to be maintained employee benefit plans and
compensation opportunities for the benefit of all Persons who are employees
of the Stewardship Entities immediately prior to the Effective Time and whose
employment is not specifically terminated at or prior to the Effective Time (a
_" Continuing Employee"_) that provides such Continuing Employee with (i) a
base salary or wage rate, as applicable, that is no less than the base
salary or wage rate, as applicable, provided to the Continuing Employees
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits that in the
aggregate, are substantially comparable to the employee benefit and
compensation opportunities that are generally made available to similarly
situated employees of Columbia or its Subsidiaries ; _provided, however,_ in
no event shall any Continuing Employee be eligible to participate in any
frozen plan of Columbia or its Subsidiaries.

  

(b) At the sole discretion of Columbia, Columbia may maintain
Stewardship Bank's health and welfare plans through the end of the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
Columbia determines prior to the Effective Time to terminate one or more of
Stewardship Bank's health and/or welfare plans, then at the written request
of Columbia, Stewardship Bank shall adopt resolutions, to the extent
required, providing that one or more of Stewardship Bank's health and welfare
plans (excluding any plans that are mutually agreed to in writing between the
parties) will be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time
(or such later date as requested by Columbia in writing or as may be required
to comply with any applicable advance notice or other requirements contained
in such plans) and shall arrange for termination of all
corresponding insurance policies, service agreements and related arrangements
effective on the same date to the extent not prohibited by the terms of such
arrangements or, if termination is prohibited on the same date, the earliest
possible date following that date that is not prohibited by the terms of such
arrangements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no coverage of any of the
Continuing Employees or their dependents shall terminate under any of
Stewardship Bank's health and welfare plans prior to the time such
Continuing Employees and their dependents, as applicable, become eligible to
participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all
similarly-situated employees of Columbia and its Subsidiaries and their
dependents and, consequently, no Continuing Employee shall experience a gap
in coverage. Columbia shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
Continuing Employees who become covered under health (including dental and
vision) plans, programs and benefits of Columbia or any of its Subsidiaries to
receive credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid under Stewardship
Bank's health (including dental and vision) plans for the plan year in which
coverage commences under Columbia's health plan and to waive any pre-existing
conditions under any such plans. Terminated employees of Stewardship Entities
and their qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued
coverage under group health plans of Columbia in accordance with COBRA.

   

63 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(c) Columbia shall cause each employee benefit plan of Columbia
in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate to take into
account for purposes of eligibility and vesting under the employee benefit
plans of Columbia (but not for purposes of benefit accrual) the service of
such employees with Stewardship to the same extent as such service was
credited for such purpose by Stewardship; provided, however, that such
service shall not be recognized: (i) for purposes of the six (6) month waiting
period for eligibility under the ESOP; (ii) to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits under any of the
Columbia Benefit Plans, or (iii) to the extent, at the sole discretion of
Columbia, the cash value of unused paid time-off is paid to Continuing
Employees at the Effective Time. The value of each Stewardship Employee's
unused paid time-off is set forth in Stewardship's Disclosure Letter. This
Agreement shall not be construed to limit the ability of Columbia
to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee or to review any
employee benefit plan or program from time to time and to make such changes
(including terminating any such plan or program) as Columbia deems
appropriate.

  

(d) Stewardship Bank shall take all necessary and appropriate
actions to cause the Stewardship Bank 401(k) Plan to be frozen as to future
contributions effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and Columbia
shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to allow the Continuing
Employees to participate in Columbia's 401(k) Plan on the first Columbia
401(k) Plan entry date following the Effective Time. If requested in writing
by Columbia prior to Closing, Stewardship Bank will also take all
necessary steps to terminate Stewardship Bank's 401(k) Plan immediately prior
to the Effective Time, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, and
if further requested, shall prepare and submit a request to the IRS for a
favorable determination letter on termination. If Columbia requests that
Stewardship Bank apply for a favorable determination letter, then prior to the
Effective Time, Stewardship Bank shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take all such actions as are necessary (determined in consultation with
Columbia) to submit the application for favorable determination letter in
advance of the Effective Time, and following the Effective Time, Columbia
shall use its best efforts in good faith to obtain such favorable
determination letter as promptly as possible (including, but not limited to,
making such changes to the Stewardship Bank 401(k) Plan as may be required by
the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a favorable determination letter).
Prior to the Effective Time, Stewardship Bank, and following the Effective
Time, Columbia, will adopt such amendments to the Stewardship Bank 401(k) Plan
necessary to effect the provisions of this _Section 6.4(d)_. In the event
Columbia requests Stewardship Bank to submit an application to the IRS for a
determination letter, Stewardship Bank 401(k) Plan participants who are
terminated at or after the Closing, but prior to the receipt of the IRS
determination letter, may elect to receive a distribution from the Stewardship
Bank 401(k) Plan upon termination of their employment. Following receipt of a
favorable determination letter from the IRS, Columbia shall take any and all
actions as may be required to permit Continuing Employees to roll over their
account balances (excluding participant loans) in the Stewardship Bank 401(k)
Plan into Columbia's 401(k) Plan.

(e) Columbia agrees that each full-time Stewardship Employee who
is (i) involuntarily terminated by Columbia (other than for "Cause" as
determined in good faith by Columbia) or (ii) voluntarily terminates
employment if not offered a Comparable Position (as defined below) within six
(6) months following the Effective Time and, in case of either (i) or (ii)
above, who is not covered by a separate severance, change in control or
employment agreement shall, upon executing an appropriate release in the form
reasonably determined by Columbia, receive a single lump sum severance payment
equal to two weeks of base pay (at the rate in effect on the termination
date) for each year of service at Stewardship, with a minimum equal to four
weeks of base pay and a maximum equal to twenty-six (26) weeks of base pay
and, in addition, will receive, up to a maximum of two (2) weeks, the cash
value of unused paid time-off for fiscal year 2019 for such terminated
employee at the Effective Time, subject to applicable payroll withholdings.
For purposes of calculating the number of years of service, fractional years
of service shall be rounded up or down to the nearest full year. For purposes
of calculating base pay, Stewardship Employees who are paid on an hourly
basis shall be deemed to have a base pay equal to the employee's average
weekly compensation over the two (2) months prior to the termination date;
provided that, in no event shall an employee's base pay for this purpose be
less than the employee's base pay with Stewardship as in effect immediately
prior to Closing. For employees whose compensation is determined in whole
or in part on the basis of commission income, "base pay" shall include base
salary or total hourly wages paid plus commissions earned during the most
recent twelve (12) months ended as of the date of termination of employment.
For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, Columbia
will offer employees of Stewardship Entities whose jobs are eliminated as a
result of the Merger priority in applying for open positions within Columbia.
Any employee of Stewardship or Stewardship Bank who has or is a party to any
employment agreement, severance agreement, change in control agreement or any
other agreement or arrangement that provides for any payment that may be
triggered by a termination, including a termination following the Merger,
shall not receive the severance benefits as provided in this Section but will
receive the payment specified in such agreement or arrangement. " _Comparable
Position "_ means a job position that: (i) provides for base compensation
equal to or higher that an employee's base compensation in effect on the
Effective Time and (ii) is located within twenty-five (25) miles of a
an employee's primary office/branch on the Effective Time.

  

(f) Columbia shall honor all obligations under the change in
control agreements set forth in Stewardship's Disclosure Letter, except to
the extent any such agreement is superseded, amended or terminated as of, or
following, the Effective Time.

  

(g) This Agreement is an agreement solely between Stewardship
and Columbia. Except for the indemnification rights provided in Section 6.6,
nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 6.4, whether express or
implied, confers upon any Stewardship Employees, employees of Columbia and
its Subsidiaries or any other Person, any rights or remedies, including: (i)
any right to employment or recall, (ii) any right to continued employment for
any specified period, or (iii) any right to any particular
compensation, benefit or aggregate of benefits, or any other term or
condition of employment, of any kind or nature whatsoever.

   

65

(h) As of the earlier of the Closing Date or the applicable
reporting deadline under the Affordable Care Act, Stewardship, Stewardship
Bank and each Commonly Controlled Entity will accurately complete and timely
file with the Internal Revenue service, and timely send to all covered
individuals, as applicable, any required IRS Forms 1094 B, 1095 B, 1094 C and
1095 C for the 2018 calendar year with respect to each Plan that is subject
to the Affordable Care Act.

  

(i) Within forty-five (45) days after the date of this
Agreement, Columbia shall designate, in consultation with
Stewardship, certain employees of the Stewardship Bank who will be eligible
to receive a retention bonus from Columbia, in its sole discretion, in the
event such employee remains a Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date
and/or through a post-Closing transition period to be determined by Columbia,
including systems conversion, if applicable.

  

(j) At and following the Effective Time, Columbia shall be
solely responsible, to the extent applicable, for timely providing any
required notices under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
of 1988, as amended (the " _WARN ACT_ "), or any similar state or local Law,
with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN
Act or similar law) or employee layoff or similar event affecting the
Stewardship Employees after the Effective Date.

  

6.5   _Updated Schedules_. On a date fifteen (15) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time and on the Effective Time, Stewardship will modify
any Schedule to this Agreement or add any Schedule or Schedules for the
purpose of making the representations and warranties to which any such
Schedule relates true and correct in all material respects as of such date,
whether to correct any misstatement or omission in any Schedule or to reflect
any additional information obtained by Stewardship subsequent to the date any
Schedule was previously delivered by Stewardship to Columbia. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any updated Schedule will not have the effect of making any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement true and correct in
all material respects for purposes of Section 7.3(a).

  

6.6   _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  

(a) Columbia agrees that all rights of the present and former
directors and officers of any of the Stewardship Entities to indemnification
provided for in the Charter or Bylaws or other governing documents of such
Stewardship Entity, as applicable, as in effect on the date hereof, or
required under any applicable Law (including rights to advancement of expenses
and exculpation), will survive the Merger and continue in full force and
effect for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time (each
such director and officer being sometimes hereinafter be referred to as an "
_Indemnified Party_ "). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Columbia agrees that, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
will indemnify any person made a party to any proceeding by reason of the
fact that such person was a director, officer, member or employee of any of
the Stewardship Entities at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest
extent provided in, and will advance expenses in accordance with, the
Charter, Bylaws and other governing documents of the Stewardship Entities, as
applicable, in the form previously provided to Columbia and effective as of
the date of this Agreement, in each case subject to all the limitations
set forth in such Charter, Bylaws or other governing documents and applicable
Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.6,
nothing contained in this Agreement will require Columbia to indemnify, defend
or hold harmless any Indemnified Party to a greater extent than any
Stewardship Entity may, as of the date of this Agreement, indemnify, defend
and hold harmless such Indemnified Party, and any such indemnification
provided pursuant to this Section 6.6 will be provided only to the extent
that such indemnification is permitted by any applicable federal or state
Laws.

   

66 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(b)  Prior to the Effective Time, Stewardship will or, if
Stewardship is unable to, Columbia as of the Effective Time will, obtain a
"tail" insurance policy with a claims period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D
andO Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage and deductibles at least
as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the existing policies of the
Stewardship Entities with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby). Columbia will pay the
premium for such DandO Insurance tail policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event will Columbia be required to expend more than 250% of the current
amount expended on an annual basis by the Stewardship Entities to procure
their existing DandO Insurance policies. If Stewardship or Columbia for any
reason is unable to obtain such tail DandO Insurance policy on or prior to the
Effective Time, Columbia will obtain as much as comparable DandO Insurance as is
available at a cost in the aggregate for such six (6) year period up to 250%
of the current annual premiums expended by the Stewardship Entities for their
existing DandO Insurance policies.

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are intended to be for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party as if he
or she were a party to this Agreement. The indemnification rights provided to
each Indemnified Party pursuant hereto will be in addition to all other
indemnification rights provided to such Indemnified Party under any Contract
between any of the Stewardship Entities and such Indemnified Party. If any
Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or advancement
of expenses under this Section 6.6 that is denied by Columbia, and a court of
competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
such indemnification or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, then
Columbia shall pay such Indemnified Party's costs and expenses, including
legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with enforcing such claim
against Columbia.

  

6.7   _Statutory Trust_. Stewardship, as the owner of the
Statutory Trust Securities that are common securities, will cause the
Statutory Trust (a) to remain a statutory trust, (b) to otherwise continue to
be classified as a grantor trust for federal income Tax purposes, and (c) to
cause each holder of Statutory Trust Securities that are preferred securities
to be treated as owning an undivided beneficial interest in the Statutory
Trust Debentures. At the Effective Time, Columbia will assume Stewardship's
obligations and acquire its rights relating to the Statutory Trust, including
Stewardship's obligations and rights under the Statutory Trust Debentures,
Statutory Trust Securities and the other Statutory Trust Agreements. In
connection therewith, Stewardship will assist Columbia in
assuming Stewardship's obligations and acquiring its rights under the
Statutory Trust, and will provide the documentation required to make such
assumption of obligations and acquisition of rights effective, including any
supplemental indentures, certificates and opinions of counsel that may be
required under the Statutory Trust Agreements. Subject to the terms of the
Statutory Trust Securities, immediately prior to the Closing, Stewardship
will pay, or cause to be paid, to the proper Persons all deferred and accrued
but unpaid interest and any outstanding fees relating to the Statutory Trust
Debentures and the Statutory Trust.

6.8   _Assumption of Subordinated Notes_. Columbia agrees to
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of
Columbia at or prior to the Effective Time one or more supplemental
indentures, guarantees, and/or other instruments required for the due
assumption of the Subordinated Notes. Stewardship shall obtain the consents
of the holders of the Subordinated Notes for the assignment and assumption of
the Subordinated Notes by Columbia, to the extent such consent is required
under the Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement dated August 28, 2015 by and
between Stewardship and the holders of the Subordinated Notes.

  

6.9   _Loan Participations._ Upon reasonable prior notice,
Stewardship shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Columbia
with access to the originating lenders of the Loan Participations for the
purpose of enabling Columbia to conduct reasonable due diligence on such Loan
Participations; provide that Columbia shall not contract or communicate with
the participants of such Loan Participations in any manner relating to
Stewardship or Stewardship's business without Stewardship's prior approval
and Stewardship shall have the right to participate in any such contact
or communication.

  

6.10   _Board Representation; Advisory Board_ Following the date
hereof, Columbia and Columbia Bank shall take all actions necessary to: (a)
cause, effective as of the Effective Time, their respective Boards of
Directors to be expanded by one member; and (b) appoint Paul Van Ostenbridge
to the Boards of Directors of Columbia and Columbia Bank. Subject solely to
the fiduciary duties of the Columbia and Columbia Bank Boards of Directors,
Columbia and Columbia Bank will use reasonable best efforts to cause the
election of Mr. Van Ostenbridge to each of the Columbia and Columbia Bank
Boards of Directors at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of
Columbia and Columbia Bank (including recommending that the stockholders vote
in favor of the election of Mr. Van Ostenbridge (along with other nominees)
and otherwise supporting Mr. Van Ostenbridge for election in a manner no less
rigorous and favorable than the manner in which Columbia supports its other
nominees in the aggregate. In addition, Columbia Bank will establish and
maintain an advisory board (the " _Advisory Board_ ") for a period of one
year following the Effective Time and invite other non-employees directors of
Stewardship's Board of Directors to join the Advisory Board.

  

6.11   _Columbia Confidential Information_. Any confidential
information or trade secrets of each of Columbia and its Subsidiaries
received by any Stewardship Entity and its Representatives in connection
with the Merger, the Bank Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby will be treated confidentially and held in confidence pursuant to the
Columbia NDA, and any correspondence, memoranda, records, copies, documents
and electronic or other media of any kind containing either such confidential
information or trade secrets or both will be destroyed by the Stewardship
Entities or, at Columbia's request, returned to Columbia if this Agreement is
terminated as provided in Article 8\. Such information will not be used by
any Stewardship Entity or its employees or agents to the detriment of Columbia
and its Subsidiaries, and will at all times be maintained and held in
compliance with the Columbia NDA.

6.12   _Stewardship Confidential Information_. If the Closing does
not occur, any confidential information or trade secrets of each of
Stewardship and its Subsidiaries received by Columbia, Columbia Bank and
their Representatives in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby will be treated confidentially and
held in confidence pursuant to the Stewardship NDA, and any
correspondence, memoranda, records, copies, documents and electronic or other
media of any kind containing either such confidential information or trade

terminated as provided in Article 8\. Such information will not be used by
Columbia, Columbia Bank and their Representatives to the detriment of any
Stewardship Entity, and will at all times be maintained and held in compliance
with the terms of the Stewardship NDA.

the Board of Directors of the Columbia Bank Foundation (the _"Columbia Bank
Foundation"_) that at the Effective Time: (i) the Columbia Charitable
Foundation expand the size of its Board of Directors by one member and appoint
one member of the current Stewardship Board of Directors to serve on the
Board of Directors of the Columbia Bank Foundation; and (ii) expand its grant
policy, in accordance with its Charter and governing documents, to make
charitable contributions within Stewardship's local community largely
consistent with charitable contributions made under Stewardship's tithing

9.4   _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in Section 6.6(c), nothing expressed or referred to in
this Agreement confers any rights or remedies upon any Person that is not a
party or permitted assign of a party to this Agreement. The representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement are the product of negotiations
among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by
the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or liability to any
other person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties may not rely
upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations
of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of
any other date.

  

9.5   _Disclosure Schedules_.

  

(a) Prior to or simultaneous with the execution of this
Agreement, Stewardship delivered to Columbia the Disclosure Schedules, which
set forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or
appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained
in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in Article 4 or to one or more covenants contained
herein (whether or not such section of this Agreement expressly references a
schedule thereto). Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedules, the
information contained therein is dated as of the date of this Agreement or,
if delivered pursuant to Section 6.5, as of such date delivered.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere
inclusion of an item as an exception to a representation or warranty will not
be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, a disclosure of any
information in a particular section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedules
shall be deemed disclosure of such information with respect to any other
section or subsection of this Agreement to which the relevance of such
information is readily apparent on its face from the nature of the disclosure
that such disclosure also applies to such other Schedule.

require, references to any Contract are to that Contract as amended, modified
or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof and
thereof; _provided, however_ , that with respect to any Contract listed on
any Schedules hereto, all such amendments, modifications or supplements must

restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to

force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and
the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement and to
preserve each party's anticipated benefits under this Agreement.

FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF THE STEWARDSHIP BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHICH SHALL BE SUBJECT
TO THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.

  

9.10   _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties acknowledges and
agrees that the subject matter of this Agreement, including the business,
assets and properties of each of the Stewardship Entities, is unique, that
the other party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their

provisions of this Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which they may

ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF

IN THIS SECTION 9.11.

  

9.12   _Investigation of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

warranties and covenants made by Stewardship and Columbia in this Agreement
or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall expire and be

extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, will be treated in all manner and
respects as an original agreement or instrument and will be considered to have
the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement
or instrument will raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any
amendment hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

Entities and the Stewardship Entities acknowledges that each party to this
Agreement has been represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement
