Indebtedness Determination, Preliminary Transaction Expenses Determination and
the Preliminary Closing Date Cash Payment as set forth in the Preliminary
Accounting Report, together with a summary of the reasons therefor and
calculations which, in its view, are necessary to eliminate such objections.
If the Sellers Representative does not so object within such 30-day period,
the Preliminary Valuation Date Working Capital Statement and the Preliminary
Cash Determination, Preliminary Indebtedness Determination, Preliminary
Transaction Expenses and the Preliminary Closing Date Cash Payment set forth
in the Preliminary Accounting Report shall be final and binding as the "
_Valuation Date Working Capital Statement_ ," " _Closing Date Cash_ ," "
_Closing Date Indebtedness_ ," " _Closing Date Transaction Expenses_ ," "
_Closing Date Cash Payment,_ " and the " _Accounting Report_ ," respectively,
for purposes of this Agreement but shall not limit the representations,

Adjustments_ ") any differences as to the Preliminary Valuation Date Working
Capital Statement, Preliminary Cash Determination, Preliminary Indebtedness
Determination, Preliminary Transaction Expenses and the Preliminary Closing
Date Cash

 



      
 

 



 

Payment and, if the Sellers Representative and Buyers so resolve any such
differences, the Preliminary Valuation Date Working Capital Statement and the
Preliminary Cash Determination, Preliminary Indebtedness Determination,
Preliminary Transaction Expenses and the Preliminary Closing Date Cash Payment
set forth in the Preliminary Accounting Report as adjusted by the Agreed
Adjustments shall be final and binding as the " _Valuation Date Working
Capital Statement_ ," " _Closing Date Cash_ ," " _Closing Date Indebtedness_
," " _Closing Date Transaction Expenses_ ," " _Closing Date Cash Payment_ "
and the " _Accounting Report_ ," respectively, for purposes of this Agreement
but shall not limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
of the parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement except as expressly set
forth herein.

 



 

(d) If any objections raised by the Sellers Representative are not resolved
by Agreed Adjustments within the 30-day period next following such initial
30-day objection period, then Buyers and the Sellers Representative shall
submit the objections that are then unresolved to the Houston office of
Deloitte and Touche LLP (or to such other national accounting firm agreed to in
writing by the Sellers Representative and Buyers) and such firm (the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") shall be directed by Buyers and the Sellers
Representative to resolve the unresolved objections (based solely on the
presentations by Buyers and by the Sellers Representative as to whether any
disputed matter had been determined in a manner consistent with the Agreed
Accounting Principles) as promptly as reasonably practicable and to deliver
written notice to each of Buyers and the Sellers Representative setting forth
such Accounting Firms resolution of the disputed matters. The Preliminary
Valuation Date Working Capital Statement, Preliminary Cash Determination,
Preliminary Indebtedness Determination, Preliminary Transaction Expenses and
the Preliminary Closing Date Cash Payment, after giving effect to any Agreed
Adjustments and to the resolution of disputed matters by the Accounting Firm,
shall be final and binding as the " _Valuation Date Working Capital Statement_
," " _Closing Date Cash_ ," " _Closing Date Indebtedness_ ," " _Closing Date
Transaction Expenses_ ," " _Closing Date Cash Payment,_ " and the "
_Accounting Report_ ," respectively, for purposes of this Agreement but shall
not limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement except as expressly set forth
herein.

 



 

(e) The parties hereto shall make available to Buyers, the Sellers
Representative and, if applicable, the Accounting Firm, such books, records
and other information (including work papers) as any of the foregoing may
reasonably request to prepare or review the Preliminary Valuation Date Working
Capital Statement, Preliminary Accounting Report or any other matters
submitted to the Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
shall be paid proportionately by Buyers and Sellers based on the determination
of the Accounting Firm of the unresolved objections submitted to it pursuant
to _Section 3.3(d)_. The calculation of such proportionate payments shall be
based on the relative position of the determination of the Accounting Firm in
comparison to the positions submitted to it by Buyers and the Sellers
Representative pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_, utilizing the values of such
items as initially submitted by the parties to the Accounting Firm. Such
proportional allocations shall be determined by the Accounting Firm at the
time its determination is rendered on the disputed items.

 



 

 **3.4.** ** ****_Adjustment of Estimated Closing Date Cash Payment_**.
Promptly (but not later than five Business Days) after the determination of
the Closing Date Cash Payment pursuant to _Section 3.3_ that is final and
binding as set forth therein:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) if the Closing Date Cash Payment exceeds the Estimated Closing Date Cash
Payment, Buyers shall pay to the Sellers Representative, as representative of
Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account
of the Sellers Representative as the Sellers Representative shall designate
in writing to Buyers, an amount equal to the excess of the Closing Date Cash
Payment over the Estimated Closing Date Cash Payment, plus interest on such
excess from the Closing Date to the date of payment thereof at the Agreed
Rate; or

 



 

(b) if the Estimated Closing Date Cash Payment exceeds the Closing Date Cash
Payment, Sellers shall pay to Buyers, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such bank account of Buyers as Buyers shall designate in
writing to the Sellers Representative, an amount equal to the excess of the
Estimated Closing Date Cash Payment over the Closing Date Cash Payment, plus
interest on such excess from the Closing Date to the date of payment thereof
at the Agreed Rate. If Sellers fail to pay such amount within such five-
Business Day time period, Buyers shall be entitled to recover such amount from
the Escrow Account and Buyers and the Sellers Representative, in such event,
shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to that effect.
In the event that Buyers recover such amount from the Escrow Amount, Sellers
shall promptly (but in any event within five Business Days of the date of such
joint written instruction) deposit or cause to be deposited cash with the
Escrow Agent in an amount equal to the amount released from the Escrow Amount
to Buyers pursuant to this _Section 3.4(b)_.

 



 

 **3.5.** ** ****_Earnout_**. Buyers shall pay to Sellers, as additional
Purchase Price hereunder, an amount (the " _Earnout Amount_ ") equal to
$25,000,000, or such proportion thereof in relation to the amount to which
Adjusted EBITDA bears between Base EBITDA and Maximum EBITDA as determined as
follows:

 



 

[Adjusted EBITDA  Base EBITDA] ÷ [Maximum EBITDA  Base EBITDA] x $25,000,000

 



 

(a) If Adjusted EBITDA for the Earnout Period exceeds Base EBITDA, then Buyers
shall pay the Earnout Amount in cash to the Sellers Representative (on behalf
of Sellers) within five Business Days following the final determination of the
Earnout Amount as hereafter provided. The maximum Earnout Amount payable under
this _Section 3.5_ is $25,000,000. If the calculation of the Earnout Amount
yields a negative number, the Earnout Amount shall be deemed to be zero and no
payment shall be made under this _Section 3.5_.

 



 

(b) Subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section 3.5_, " _Adjusted
EBITDA_ " shall mean the EBITDA of the Acquired Companies for the Earnout
Period (or, if _Section 3.5(f)_ applies, the Stub Period), subject to the
following adjustments:

 



 

(i) Other than as expressly set forth herein, Adjusted EBITDA shall be
calculated on a stand-alone basis as if the Acquired Companies were being
operated on a separate and independent basis and in a manner consistent with
the audited financial statements described in _Section 5.3(a)_, and Adjusted
EBITDA shall not reflect any deductions or expenses for any cost-sharing
expenses, management, advisory or other fees, or other corporate overhead
charges by or among KapStone, or any expenses of KapStone incurred in order to
comply with its obligations as a public company under applicable securities
laws (other than those incurred in connection with the audit of the Acquired
Companies consolidated financial statements). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
KapStone may allocate to the Acquired Companies for purposes of determining
Adjusted

 



      
 

 



 

EBITDA their allocable share of (x) the reasonable cost of all services
(including finance, accounting, legal, human resources and other centralized
functions) provided by KapStone during such period but only to the extent
provided in connection with the operation of the Business, (y) any reasonable
out-of-pocket costs for products or services purchased or procured and paid
for by KapStone from third parties for the benefit of the Acquired Companies,
such as insurance and marketing, but only to the extent purchased or procured
and paid for in connection with the operation of the Business, provided that
such costs shall be appropriately reduced to a commercially reasonable amount
that does not materially exceed the cost currently incurred by the Acquired
Companies in connection with providing such services if such costs are not
commercially reasonable or materially exceed the costs that the Acquired
Companies currently incur in connection with providing such products or
services.

 



 

(ii) There shall be added to the Acquired Companies EBITDA an amount equal to
three percent (3%) of the amount of KapStones corrugated box sales to any
customer in excess of $1,000,000 per year for such customer that any Acquired
Company provides the sales lead for or otherwise originates during the Earnout
Period if (A) (1) such customer is not an existing customer of KapStone as of
the date hereof, or (2) such customer, even though an existing customer of
KapStone, materially increased the dollar volume of its purchases as a direct
consequence of the efforts of those working for the Acquired Companies (in
which case only such increase shall be included), and (B) such sales do not
replace any current sales at the Acquired Companies.

 



 

(iii) Any purchases and sales of goods and services between KapStone and the
Acquired Companies during the Earnout Period shall be at prices and on terms
which would be reasonably obtainable by the Acquired Companies in arms-length
commercial transactions with Persons who are not Affiliated with KapStone (it
being understood that the foregoing shall not necessarily reflect the most
favorable prices and terms available in the marketplace at any given time).

 



 

(iv) There shall be excluded any legal, accounting, banking, commitment or
other fees or expenses incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any financing obtained in connection
therewith, or any dispute arising out of any of the foregoing.

 



 

(v) There shall be excluded (x) the effect of payment of the Earnout Amount
or, as applicable, a Stub Earnout Amount hereunder and (y) any expense
associated with the Victory Incentive Plan described in the Employment
Agreements.

 



 

(vi) For purposes of this _Section 3.5_, "Acquired Companies" shall include
any legal entities which are successors to the Acquired Companies in existence
on the Closing Date, inclusive of those surviving by way of merger,
consolidation, transfer of assets or otherwise.

 



 

(c) There shall be included in Adjusted EBITDA the positive Adjusted EBITDA of
any Acquired Businesses during the period in question, and the term "Acquired
Companies" for purposes of this _Section 3.5_ shall be deemed to additionally
include such Acquired Businesses.

 



       
 

 



 

Buyer shall provide prompt written notice to Sellers Representative of any
Qualified Acquisition during the Earnout Period, including the nature of the
Acquired Business and historical financial information thereof received in
connection with the Acquisition.

 



 

(d) Throughout the Earnout Period, Buyers and Parent shall cause the Acquired
Companies to maintain such financial reporting systems as necessary to
accurately determine the Acquired Companies Adjusted EBITDA as set forth
herein. Within 60 days after each fiscal year during the Earnout Period (each
such fiscal year, an " _Interim Earnout Period_ "), Sellers Representative
(if H. Benjamin Samuels or Robert Egan are members of the senior management
team of the Acquired Companies) shall provide an annual estimate of Adjusted
EBITDA for such period in writing to Buyers (each such estimate, an "
_Estimated Earnout Calculation_ "). Each Estimated Earnout Calculation shall
set forth in reasonable detail Sellers determination of Adjusted EBITDA for
the applicable Interim Earnout Period. Each party shall have reasonable access
to all relevant books and records and personnel involved in calculating the
Estimated Earnout Calculation or preparing the underlying financial statements
during normal business hours, as well as such other information as any party
may reasonably request. If Buyers disagree with any Estimated Earnout
Calculation of Sellers, Buyers shall, within 45 days after receipt thereof,
notify Sellers Representative in writing of such disagreement by setting
forth Buyers Estimated Earnout Calculation and describing in reasonable
detail the basis for such disagreement (an " _Estimated Earnout Objection
Notice_ "). If no Estimated Earnout Objection Notice is delivered by Buyers to
Sellers Representative on or prior to the 45th day after Buyers receipt of
the Estimated Earnout Calculation Statement, Sellers Estimated Earnout
Calculation shall be deemed to be the final Estimated Earnout Calculation with
respect to the Interim Earnout Period. If the Estimated Earnout Objection
Notice is timely delivered to Sellers Representative by Buyers, (A) if
Sellers Representative agrees with the Buyers Estimated Earnout Calculation
set forth in the Estimated Earnout Objection Notice, such calculation shall be
deemed to be the final Estimated Earnout Calculation with respect to the
Interim Earnout Period, or (B) if Sellers Representative disputes the Buyers
Estimated Earnout Calculation set forth in the Estimated Earnout Objection
Notice, the parties shall negotiate in good faith for a period of 30 days to
resolve their disagreements with respect to the computation of the Estimated
Earnout Calculation and to determine the Acquired Companies Adjusted EBITDA
for the applicable Information Earnout Period. If the parties are unable to
resolve any such disagreement within such 30-day period, neither Estimated
Earnout Calculation for the applicable Interim Earnout Period shall be deemed
to be the final Estimated Earnout Calculation with respect to the Interim
Earnout Period, and the disagreement shall be resolved in connection with the
final determination of the Earnout Calculation as provided in _Section
3.5(e)_ and, if applicable, _Section 3.5(f)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if at the time at which an Estimated Earnout Calculation is to be made,
neither H. Benjamin Samuels nor Robert Egan are members of the senior
management team of the Acquired Companies, then Buyers shall instead prepare
the Estimated Earnout Calculation and otherwise have the rights and
obligations afforded to Sellers and Sellers Representative above, and
Sellers Representative shall have the right to submit an Estimated Earnout
Objection Notice and otherwise have the rights and obligations afforded to
Buyers above.

 



 

(e) As promptly as practicable after the last day of the Earnout Period, but
in any event within 60 days thereafter, Buyers shall prepare and deliver to
Sellers Representative a written statement (an " _Earnout Calculation
Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail its determination of Adjusted
EBITDA for the Earnout Period and its calculation of the Earnout Amount in
accordance with this _Section 3.5_ (" _Earnout Calculation_ "). In preparing
and

 



      
 

 



 

evaluating the Earnout Calculation and Earnout Calculation Statement, Buyers
and the Sellers Representative shall consider in good faith any Estimated
Earnout Calculations that were deemed to be a final Estimated Earnout
Calculation with respect to an Interim Earnout Period pursuant to _Section
3.5(d)_. Buyers shall provide Sellers Representative with reasonable access
to all relevant books and records and personnel involved in calculating the
Earnout Calculation or preparing the underlying financial statements during
normal business hours to the extent Sellers Representative reasonably
requires such access to complete its review of Buyers Earnout Calculation, as
well as such other information as Sellers Representative reasonably requests.
If Sellers disagree with the proposed Earnout Calculation, Sellers
Representative shall, within 30 days after Sellers Representatives receipt
of the Earnout Calculation Statement, notify Buyers in writing of such
disagreement by setting forth Sellers Representatives Earnout Calculation
and describing in reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement ("Earnout
Objection Notice"). If no Earnout Objection Notice is delivered by Sellers
Representative to Buyers on or prior to the 30th day after Sellers
Representatives receipt of the Earnout Calculation Statement, Buyers Earnout
Calculation shall be final and binding on the parties. If the Earnout
Objection Notice is timely delivered to Buyers by Sellers Representative, (A)
if Buyers agree with the Earnout Calculation set forth in the Earnout
Objection Notice, Buyers shall pay, within five Business Days after receipt of
the Earnout Objection, the Earnout Payment set forth in the Earnout Objection
Notice by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by Sellers Representative or (B) if Buyers dispute the Earnout
Calculation set forth in the Earnout Objection Notice, (x) Buyers shall pay,
within five Business Days after receipt of the Earnout Objection Notice, the
lesser of the Earnout Payment due according to Sellers Representatives
Earnout Calculation and the Earnout Payment, if any, due according to Buyers
Earnout Calculation, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated by Sellers Representative and (y) the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreements with respect to the
computation of the Earnout Calculation and to determine the additional amounts
that are claimed to be due as part of the Earnout Payment, if any.

 



 

(f) If the parties are unable to resolve all such disagreements within 30 days
after Buyers receipt of the Earnout Objection Notice, either party may submit
such remaining disagreements to the Accounting Firm for resolution. The
parties shall use their respective reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting
Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements with respect to the computation of
the Earnout Calculation as soon as practicable, but in any event shall direct
the Accounting Firm to render a determination within 30 days after its
retention. The Accounting Firm shall consider only those items in the Earnout
Calculation that are identified as being items on which the parties have been
unable to agree. The Accounting Firm shall not assign a value to any item
other than a value claimed by a party. The determination of the Accounting
Firm shall be final and binding upon the parties. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm under this _Section 3.5(f)_ shall be borne by the parties in
the same manner as described in _Section 3.3(e)_.

 



 

(g) If a Change of Control occurs during the Earnout Period, Buyers shall give
Sellers Representative written notice of the occurrence of the Change of
Control, including reasonable detail concerning the nature thereof, within two
Business Days after consummation thereof, and:

 



 

(i) A " _Stub Earnout Amount_ " shall be calculated and paid for the Stub
Period using the formula set forth at the beginning of this _Section 3.5_,
except that

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Adjusted EBITDA, Base EBITDA and Maximum EBITDA shall all be calculated
with reference to the number of whole months elapsed in the Stub Period and
(ii) $12,500,000 shall be substituted for $25,000,000 in such formula. Any
Stub Earnout Amount shall be paid within five Business Days after final
determination thereof.

 



 

(ii) Buyers shall deliver to Sellers Representative an Earnout Calculation
Statement meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) above within 60 days after
the end of the Stub Period with respect to the Stub Earnout Amount, to which
Sellers Representative shall be entitled to deliver an Earnout Objection
Notice, and the parties shall follow the same procedures with respect thereto
as provided in paragraph (c) and, if applicable, paragraph (d) above.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding the occurrence of a Change of Control and payment of any
Stub Earnout Amount, at the end of the Earnout Period, the Earnout Amount
shall be calculated as provided in this _Section 3.5_ (subject to the proviso
below) and the procedures as provided in paragraph (d) and, if applicable,
paragraph (e) above, shall be observed, except that the Stub Earnout Amount
shall be deducted from the full Earnout Amount then payable (and if such
deduction yields a negative number, the remaining Earnout Amount shall be
deemed to be zero); provided that, only if this _Section 3.5(g)(iii)_ applies
and the Stub Period is less than 18 months, then (x) the Earnout Period,
Adjusted EBITDA, Base EBITDA and Maximum EBITDA shall all be calculated with
reference to the number of whole months elapsed in the Stub Period plus 12,
and (y) if the full Earnout Amount shall not have been earned in accordance
with the first two calculations (i.e., for the Stub Period and for the
adjusted Earnout Period as described in the preceding clause (x)), then the
Earnout Amount shall be again calculated for the entire 30-month Earnout
Period, according to the same procedures as aforesaid, and the amount
resulting from such calculation (less any interim Earnout Amounts paid based
upon the two previous calculations) shall then be paid to the Sellers.

 



 

 **3.6.** ** ****_Federal Income Tax Treatment; Purchase Price Allocation_**.

 



 

(a) _Agreed Tax Treatment_. Each of the Sellers and Buyers agree that, for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the acquisition of the Company Interests
(including the Mexican Interests with respect to which Buyers intend to make
the Mexican Subsidiary Section 338(g) Elections) shall be treated as an
acquisition of the Acquired Companies assets (including the assets of the
Mexican Subsidiaries) (the " _Agreed Tax Treatment_ ").

 



 

(b) _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 



 

(i) Within 120 days following the determination of the Closing Date Cash
Payment pursuant to _Section 3.3_ that is final and binding as set forth
therein, Buyers shall deliver to the Sellers Representative a schedule (the "
_Allocation Schedule_ ") (A) allocating the Purchase Price among the Interests
and (B) allocating the purchase price for the assets deemed acquired in
accordance with _Section 3.6(a)_ (which shall include, for the avoidance of
doubt and without duplication, the assets deemed acquired by the Company in
the Mexican Subsidiaries pursuant to the Mexican Subsidiary Section 338
Elections and as a

 



      
 

 



 

result of the Restructuring), as determined for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes (taking into account any relevant liabilities and the Purchase Price
allocated to the Interests pursuant to clause (A) above) among the assets
deemed acquired. The Allocation Schedule prepared by Buyers shall be
reasonable and shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Without limiting _Section
3.6(b)(ii)_ below, Buyers shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments
proposed by the Sellers Representative to the Allocation Schedule.

 



 

(ii) In preparing the Allocation Schedule pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)(i)_,
Buyers agree that they shall not allocate any amount to the Non-Competition
Agreement unless a third-party appraisal requires such an allocation. In the
event that any amount is allocated to the Non-Competition Agreement, the
Sellers Representative shall have ten (10) days to notify Buyers in writing
that the Sellers object to the amount allocated to the Non-Competition
Agreement, in which case the Sellers Representative and Buyers shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If the Sellers
Representative and Buyers are unable to reach an agreement on the amount to be
allocated to the Non-Competition Agreement for purposes of preparing IRS Form
8594 (including any necessary attachments) within 30 days following Buyers
delivery of the Allocation Schedule to the Sellers Representative, such
dispute shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm arising from such resolution under this _Section 3.6(b)(ii)_
shall be borne by the parties in the same manner as described in _Section
3.3(e)_.

 



 

(c) Each of the Sellers and Buyers agree that neither it nor any of its
Affiliates shall (i) file any U.S. federal Tax Returns in a manner that is
inconsistent with the Agreed Tax Treatment or the Allocation Schedule (taking
into account the resolution of any dispute pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)(ii)_),
or (ii) otherwise take any U.S. federal Tax position that is inconsistent with
the Agreed Tax Treatment or the Allocation Schedule (taking into account the
resolution of any dispute pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)(ii)_).

 



 

 **3.7.** ** ****_Escrow_**. Subject to the terms of _Article IV_, _Article
IX_ and _Article X_, a sum equal to the Escrow Amount shall be delivered at
Closing by Buyers to the Escrow Agent to be held in an interest bearing
account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement. Such Escrow Amount (including any interest accrued
thereon, the " _Escrow Funds_ ") shall be available for payment of any claims
made by a Buyer Group Member pursuant to _Article XI_ and in accordance with
_Section 11.1(c)_ and the terms of the Escrow Agreement. On the date that is
twelve months following the Closing Date, $20,000,000, less the amount of any
claims paid from the Escrow Account prior to the date of such distribution, of
the Escrow Funds then held in the Escrow Account shall be released to the
Sellers Representative for distribution to the Sellers, unless prior to that
date Buyers advise the Escrow Agent and the Sellers Representative in writing
that any claim for indemnification under _Article XI_ (each, a " _Pending
Claim_ ") by any Buyer Group Member has been asserted and is then pending. Any
such notice shall specify the total amount of the Pending Claim(s). If such
notice is timely received by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall release
only that part of the Escrow Funds that is eligible to be released pursuant to
the preceding sentence that exceeds the sum of (i) the total amount of any
Pending Claim(s) received and (ii) the total amount of any

 



      
 

 



 

claims paid from the Escrow Account prior to such release, with the remaining
funds to be held in the Escrow Account until such Pending Claim(s) are
resolved. On the date that is eighteen months following the Closing Date, the
remainder, if any, of the Escrow Funds shall be released to the Sellers
Representative for distribution to the Sellers, subject to the procedure for
Pending Claims set forth above.

 



 

 **3.8.** ** ****_Withholding_**. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Buyers shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amount, if any, as
may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable U.S. federal, state or local or foreign Tax
Requirements of Laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld
by Buyers and are paid to the appropriate Taxing authority in accordance with
Requirements of Laws, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the respective Seller or
other Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Buyers.

interest rate hedges shall be terminated by the Acquired Companies at or prior
to the Closing and the Acquired Companies currency exchange and commodity
price hedges will not be terminated at Closing. As to any such hedges which
are not terminated at Closing, and as to letters of credit then outstanding,
Buyers shall, as they shall elect in their sole discretion, at and in
connection with Closing (i) provide for the assumption thereof under Buyers
credit facilities, (ii) cause all such hedges and letters of credit to be

ARTICLE V

 



 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

 



 

As an inducement to Buyers to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, Sellers, jointly and severally, hereby
represent and warrant to Buyers and agree as follows, except as set forth in
the applicable Schedules (it being understood that any information set forth
in one such Schedule shall be deemed to apply to other Schedules to which its
relevance is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure):

 



 

 **5.1.** ** ****_Organization of the Acquired Companies; Title to
Interests_**.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 5.1(A)_ sets forth a listing of the legal name and jurisdiction
of organization of each Acquired Company. Each Acquired Company is a
corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state or country
of organization. Each Acquired Company is duly qualified to transact business
as a foreign corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership, as
applicable, and is in good standing in each jurisdiction set forth under such
Acquired Companys name in _Schedule 5.1(A)_, which jurisdictions are the
only ones in which the ownership or leasing of its respective assets and
properties or the conduct of the Business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Acquired Company has full
corporate, limited liability company or limited partnership power and
authority to own or lease and to operate and use its respective properties and
assets and to carry on the Business as now conducted.

 



 

(b) True and complete copies of the certificate or articles of incorporation
and all amendments thereto and of the By-laws (or other comparable governing
documents if such Acquired Company is not a corporation), as amended to date,
of each Acquired Company have been made available to Buyers.

 



 

(c) The issued and outstanding equity, ownership and economic interests of (i)
the Company consists exclusively of the Company Interests, (ii) Victory Mexico
consists exclusively of the Mexican Interests and the equity interests of
Victory Mexico owned by the Company, and (iii) at the Closing,
Comercializadora will consist exclusively of the Mexican Interests and the
equity interests owned by the Company. All of (i) the Company Interests are
owned by VP Holdco and VPM of record and beneficially free from all
Encumbrances other than Encumbrances imposed by federal and state securities
laws, and (ii) the equity interests in Victory Mexico and of Comercializadora
will on the Closing Date be owned by Victory MD and the Company, respectively,
of record and beneficially free from all Encumbrances other than

 



      
 

 



 

Encumbrances imposed by applicable securities laws. _Schedule 5.1(C)_ sets
forth the authorized capital stock (or other applicable equity, ownership or
economic interests) of each Acquired Company and indicates the number of
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock, the number of issued shares of
capital stock held as treasury shares and the number of shares of capital
stock unissued and not reserved for any purpose of each Acquired Company.
Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.1(C)_ and except for this Agreement, there
are no agreements, arrangements, options, warrants, calls, rights (including
preemptive rights) or commitments of any character relating to the issuance,
sale, purchase or redemption of any equity, ownership and economic interests
of any Acquired Company. All of the outstanding equity, ownership and economic
interests of each Acquired Company are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and all of the outstanding equity, ownership and economic
interests of each Acquired Company have been offered, issued, sold and
delivered in compliance with all applicable federal, state or foreign
securities laws, as applicable. None of the Acquired Companies has any
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of
which, in the capacities as such holders, have the right to vote (or that are
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
such Persons equity holders on any matter.

 



 

(d) Except as shown on _Schedule 5.1(D)_ , as of the date hereof, the Company
owns of record, beneficially and free from all Encumbrances other than
Encumbrances imposed by applicable securities laws, 100% of the issued shares
of capital stock, membership interests and other securities of each of the
Acquired Companies other than 100% of the equity interests of
Comercializadora. As of the Closing, the Company or a Subsidiary will own of
record, beneficially free from all Encumbrances other than Encumbrances
imposed by applicable securities laws, 100% of the issued shares of capital
stock, membership interests and other securities of each of the Acquired
Companies. None of the Acquired Companies owns, beneficially or otherwise, any
shares or other securities of, or any direct or indirect equity interest in,
any Person (other than another Acquired Company). None of the Acquired
Companies has agreed or is obligated to make any future investment in or
capital contribution to any Person.

 



 

(e) Upon delivery to Buyers on the Closing Date of the Company Interests as
contemplated by _Section 4.4_, Sellers will thereby transfer to Buyers good
and indefeasible title to the Interests, free and clear of all Encumbrances
other than Encumbrances imposed by applicable securities laws.

 



 

 **5.2.** ** ****_Organization and Authority of Sellers; No Conflict_**.

 



 

(a) Each Seller has full corporate or limited liability company power and
authority to own the Company Interests and to execute, deliver and perform
this Agreement and all of the Seller Ancillary Agreements to which it is a
party. Each Sellers execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the Seller Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party have been duly
authorized and approved by the respective board of directors or managers, as
the case may be, of each Seller, and do not require any further authorization
or consent of either Seller or its board of directors or managers. This
Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each Seller and
is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Seller enforceable in
accordance with its terms (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by Buyers), and each of the Seller Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party
has been duly authorized by each Seller and upon execution and delivery by
each Seller will be a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Seller
enforceable in accordance with its terms (assuming due authorization,

 



      
 

 



 

execution and delivery of each counterparty to such Seller Ancillary
Agreement), in each case subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Requirements of Laws of general application relating to
or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.2(B)_ , neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or any of the Seller Ancillary Agreements or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby nor
compliance with or fulfillment of the terms, conditions and provisions hereof
or thereof will:

 



 

(i) conflict with, result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions
of, or constitute a default, event of default or an event creating rights of
acceleration, termination or cancellation or a loss of rights under, or result
in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance upon any of the Interests or
any assets or properties of a Seller or any Acquired Company, under (A) the
charter or by-laws (or any comparable governing document) of either Seller or
any Acquired Company, (B) any Acquired Company Agreement, (C) any other
material Contract, franchise, permit or other right, restriction or obligation
to which a Seller or any Acquired Company is a party or the Interests or the
assets or properties of any Acquired Company are subject or by which a Seller
or any Acquired Company is bound, (D) any Court Order to which a Seller or any
Acquired Company is a party or any of the Interests are subject or by which a
Seller or Acquired Company is bound, or (E) any Requirements of Laws affecting
a Seller or any Acquired Company, the Interests or the assets or Business of
the Acquired Companies, except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), for such
conflicts, breaches, defaults or events of default that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Business in any material respect and would not prevent the consummation of any
of the transactions contemplated hereby; or

 



 

(ii) require the approval, consent, authorization or act of, or the making by
a Seller or any Acquired Company of any declaration, filing or registration
with, any Person, except as provided under the HSR Act.

 



 

 **5.3.** ** ****_Financial Statements_**.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 5.3(A)_ contains (i) the audited consolidated balance sheets of
the Acquired Companies as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 and the
related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income,
partners capital and cash flows for the two year(s) then ended, together with
the notes to such financial statements and the audit report thereon of
Weinstein Spira and Company, P.C. (such audited balance sheet of the Acquired

statements of income, partners capital and cash flows have been prepared in
conformity with the Agreed Accounting Principles in effect as of the date
hereof consistently applied, and such balance sheets and related statements of
income, partners capital and cash flows present fairly the financial position
and results of operations and cash flows of the Acquired Companies in all

 



       
 

 



 

material respects as of their respective dates and for the respective periods
covered thereby; provided, however, that such unaudited balance sheet is
subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments and does not include
footnotes.

 



 

(b) The books, records and accounts of the Acquired Companies accurately and
fairly reflect in all material respects, in reasonable detail, the

other documents promulgating such internal accounting controls.

Sheet Date, there has been no Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in
_Schedule 5.4_ , since the Balance Sheet Date, the Acquired Companies have
conducted the Business only in the ordinary course and in conformity with past
practice. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, since the Balance
Sheet Date, except as set forth in _Schedule 5.4_ , no Acquired Company has
taken any action that would violate _Section 7.4_ had such action been taken
after the date of this Agreement (other than the Restructuring).

subject to any material Liability, other than (i) Liabilities of the kind and

the same nature as those set forth in the Balance Sheet that were reasonably
incurred in the ordinary course of the Business after the Balance Sheet Date
consistent with past practice, (iii) Liabilities relating to the future

period prior to the Closing, and (iv) Liabilities arising under this Agreement
and the Seller Ancillary Agreements.

including using reasonable efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Debt
Commitment Letter and negotiate in good faith and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing (A) on the terms and subject to the
conditions reflected in the Debt Commitment Letter or (B) on other terms that
are acceptable in good faith to Buyers, provided that such terms do not
contain any conditions to funding that are not set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter and otherwise would not reasonably be expected to delay the
Closing in any material respect; (ii) comply on a timely basis with all
covenants, and satisfy on a timely basis all conditions, required to be
complied with or satisfied by Buyers in the Debt Commitment Letter and in such
definitive financing agreements; (iii) cause the Financing to be consummated

obligations under this Agreement; (iv) pay in a timely manner any and all

to the extent required to obtain the Financing; and (vi) enforce its rights
under the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive financing agreements, as
applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, (1) Buyers shall have the right to substitute other
debt or equity financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the same
or alternative financing sources so long as such substitute financing is
subject to funding conditions that are not materially less favorable to Buyers
than the funding conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and so
long as such substitute financing would not reasonably be expected to delay
the Closing in any material respect and (2) Buyers shall not be required to,
and Buyers shall not be required to cause any other Person to, commence,
participate in, pursue or defend any suit, action or proceeding against or
involving any of the Persons that have committed to provide any portion of, or
otherwise with respect to, the Financing. In the event any alternative

 



      
 

 



 

or substitute financing is obtained by Buyers in accordance with the terms of
this _Section 7.8(a)_ (the " _Alternative Financing_ "), references herein to
the Financing (including, for avoidance of doubt, the references in this
_Section 7.8_, but excluding references in _Section 6.4 _shall be deemed to
refer to the Alternative Financing, and if a new financing commitment letter
is entered into in connection with such Alternative Financing (the " _New
Commitment Letter_ "), references herein to the Debt Commitment Letter
(including, for avoidance of doubt, the references in this _Section 7.8_, but
excluding the references in _Section 6.4_) shall be deemed to refer to the
New Commitment Letter. Buyers will provide the Company with a copy of any New
Commitment Letter obtained by Buyers in connection with an Alternative
Financing as promptly as practicable after the execution thereof.

 



 

(b) Buyers shall keep Sellers reasonably informed with respect to all material
activity concerning the status of the Financing, including the status of
Buyers efforts to comply with its covenants under, and satisfy the conditions
contemplated by, the Debt Commitment Letter and shall give Sellers prompt
notice of any event or change that Buyers determine will materially and
adversely affect the ability of Buyers to consummate the Financing. Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyers agree to notify Sellers promptly, and in any
event within two Business Days, if at any time: (i) the Debt Commitment Letter
shall expire or be terminated for any reason; (ii) any financing source that
is a party to the Debt Commitment Letter notifies Buyers that such source no
longer intends to provide financing to Buyers on the terms set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter; or (iii) Buyers otherwise determine that Buyers are
unlikely timely to receive the Financing. Buyers shall not, without the prior
written consent of Sellers Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), amend the Debt Commitment Letter or the
definitive financing agreements, as applicable, in any manner (including by
way of a side letter or other binding agreement, arrangement or understanding)
that would: (A) expand in any material respect or amend in a manner materially
adverse to Buyers the conditions to the obligations of the lenders to make the
Financing available set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter; (B) prevent or
materially impair or delay the Closing; (C) subject to Buyers ability to
obtain substitute financing set forth in _Section 7.8(a)_, reduce the
aggregate amount of financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter to an
amount below the amount needed (in combination with all funds held by or
otherwise available to Buyers) to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; or (D) materially and adversely impact the ability of Buyers
to enforce their rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the definitive financing agreements, as applicable. Buyers shall
deliver to the Sellers Representative a copy of the definitive financing
agreements a promptly as practicable, and in any event no later than one
Business Day after the execution and delivery thereof. Buyers shall provide to
the Sellers Representative a copy of the then-current draft of the definitive
financing agreements not later than two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyers acknowledge
and agree that the availability of funding (Financing or otherwise) is not a
condition precedent (under _Article IX_ or otherwise) to its obligations to
close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any failure of the
Financing described in the Debt Commitment Letter shall in no way alter the
representation of Buyers set forth in _Section 6.4_ that it has sufficient
funds available to fully fund all of its obligations under this Agreement or
its agreement that availability of funding is not a condition precedent to its
obligations to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **7.9.** ** ****_Pre-Closing Restructuring_**.

 



 

(a) Prior to Closing, Sellers shall cause the Company and Victory MD to enter

all documents utilized in connection with such transactions at least two
Business Days prior to their execution and shall consider in good faith any
comments provided by Buyers.

cause the Acquired Companies to make one or more distributions of Cash to the
Sellers such that (i) Estimated Closing Date Cash in the United States shall
be as near to zero as reasonably practicable and (ii) Estimated Closing Date

shall cause the Acquired Companies to continue to make all capital
expenditures and material commitments for capital expenditures provided for in
the Acquired Companies 2015 capital expenditure budget, which is set forth in
_Schedule 7.10_ , consistent with past practice and in the ordinary course of
business as if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement were not
occurring. No such capital expenditures or material commitments for capital
expenditures shall be made with any Related Persons.

Governmental Permit.

(a) Within five (5) Business Days following the date hereof, Sellers shall
cause Timmons and Seefried to either (i) amend the Escrowed Lease Agreements
to be re-dated in blank or amended to specify that the term and rent
obligations of each Escrowed Lease Agreement shall not commence until the
agent holding the Escrowed Lease Agreements delivers them to Seefried as a
result of the transactions under the Timmons-Seefried Purchase Agreement
failing to close because of a default by Timmons, or (ii) amend each Timmons-
Seefried Purchase Agreement to specify that the Escrowed Lease Agreements
shall be re-dated upon such release from escrow; and Sellers shall promptly
provide copies of such amendments to Buyers.

 



 

(b) Sellers agree, and agrees to cause Timmons, to keep Buyers reasonably
informed regarding the status of the Timmons-Seefried Purchase Agreements,
including any actual or alleged default thereunder by Timmons. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) if the closing under a Timmons-Seefried
Purchase Agreement occurs and Timmons or its designee acquires the applicable
Escrowed Real Property, then the applicable Timmons Lease Agreement shall come
into effect and shall be honored by the parties, and the Sellers agree to
indemnify the Company against any Losses arising from the applicable Escrowed
Lease Agreement if for any reason Seefried seeks to enforce same against the
Company, or (ii) if the closing under a Timmons-Seefried Purchase Agreement
does not occur as a result of Timmons default, then the applicable Escrowed
Lease Agreement shall (if so elected by Seefried) come in effect and shall be
honored by the parties, and the Sellers agree to indemnify the Company against
any Losses arising from

 



      
 

 



 

the applicable Timmons Lease Agreement if for any reason Timmons seeks to
enforce same against the Company.

 



 

(c) The amount due from Timmons to the Company for the Earnest Money shall be
included in the Valuation Date Working Capital Amount. At such time as each
Earnest Money is either (i) applied to the purchase price of the Escrowed
Property upon the closing under the applicable Timmons-Seefried Purchase
Agreement, (ii) released from escrow and retained by Seefried as damages
pursuant to the applicable Timmons-Seefried Purchase Agreement or (iii)
released from escrow and returned to Timmons pursuant to the applicable
Timmons-Seefried Purchase Agreement, Sellers shall cause Timmons to (or, if
Timmons for any reason fails to do so, Seller shall) reimburse the applicable
Earnest Money to the Company.

(a) _Liability for Taxes_.

 



 

(i) The Sellers shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to _Article XI_,
each Seller agrees, jointly and severally, to defend, indemnify and hold
harmless each Buyer Group Member from and against any and all Losses and
Expenses incurred by such Buyer Group Member in connection with or arising
from, (A) Taxes imposed on an Acquired Company, or for which an Acquired
Company may otherwise be liable, for any taxable year or period that ends on
or before the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and
(B) Taxes imposed on a Buyer Group Member as a result of such Buyer Group
Member being a United States shareholder (within the meaning of Section 951(b)
of the Code) of either of the Mexican Subsidiaries, to the extent such amounts

meaning of Section 952(a) of the Code) arising in a calendar year ending prior
to the Closing Date.

 



 

(ii) For purposes of _Section 8.1(a)(i)_, whenever it is necessary to
determine the liability for Taxes of an Acquired Company for a Straddle
Period, the determination of the Taxes of the Company or such Subsidiary for
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date
shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two
taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and
the other which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date
and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of an Acquired Company
for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or
periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the
Acquired Company were closed at the close of the Closing Date, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that exemptions, allowances, deductions or Taxes that are
calculated on an annual basis, such as property Taxes and depreciation
deductions, shall be apportioned between such two taxable years or periods on
a daily basis.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Buyers, on the one hand, and the Sellers, jointly and severally, on the
other hand, shall each be liable for and pay, and pursuant to _Article XI_

of such Tax Returns. Buyers shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking

due in respect of such Tax Returns.

 



 

(ii) Unless otherwise required by applicable Requirements of Laws, all Tax
Returns required to be filed in accordance with this paragraph (b) relating to
Tax periods ending on or before, or including the Closing Date, shall be
prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice and, on such Tax
Returns, no position shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is
inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in preparing
and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods (including positions,
elections or methods that would have the effect of deferring income to periods
ending after the Closing Date or accelerating deductions to periods ending on
or before the Closing Date).

 



 

(iii) The Sellers Representative shall, on behalf of the Sellers, reimburse
Buyers the Taxes for which Sellers are liable pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_

Buyers, any of their Affiliates or, after the Closing Date, an Acquired
Company of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or
foreign Tax audits or assessments relating to any taxable period ending on or

to comply with this provision shall not affect Buyers right to
indemnification under this Agreement except to the extent such failure
materially impairs the Sellers ability to contest any such Tax liabilities.

 



 

(ii) Sellers Representative shall have the sole right to represent an
Acquired Companys interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court

 



      
 

 



 

proceeding relating to a Tax liability (A) for which Sellers would be required
to indemnify Buyer Group Members pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_ and (B) that
relates solely to a taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing
Date, and to employ counsel of Sellers Representatives choice at Sellers
Representatives expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that except for Tax audits
and administrative or court proceedings disclosed on _Schedule 5.6(B)_ ,
Sellers Representative shall have no right to represent an Acquired Companys
interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding unless (1)
Sellers Representative shall have first notified Buyers in writing of
Sellers Representatives intention to do so and of the identity of counsel,
if any, chosen by Sellers Representative in connection therewith and (2) the
Sellers agree with Buyers that, as between Buyers and Sellers, Sellers shall,
jointly and severally, be liable for any Losses and Expenses relating to Taxes

permitted, at Buyers expense, to be present at, and participate in, any such
audit or proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers Representative
shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the
commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes which could adversely affect
the liability for Taxes of any Buyer Group Member, an Acquired Company or any
Affiliate thereof for any period after the Closing Date to any extent without
the prior written consent of Buyers, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(iii) Buyers shall have the sole right to represent an Acquired Companys
interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to
Tax liabilities other than those for which Sellers has exercised such right
pursuant to paragraph _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and to employ counsel of Buyers
choice at Buyers expense. Buyers shall have the sole right to defend an
Acquired Company with respect to any issue, and settle or compromise any
issue, arising in connection with any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding to the extent Buyers shall have agreed in writing to forego any
indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such issue.

 



 

(iv) Nothing herein shall be construed to impose on Buyers any obligation to
defend an Acquired Company in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding. Any proceeding with respect to which Sellers Representative does
not assume control in accordance with this _Section 8.1(c)_ may be settled or
compromised in the discretion of Buyers, and any such settlement or compromise
shall not affect any Buyer Group Members right to indemnification under this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, each of Sellers and
Buyers shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to):

appropriate to establish a permissible exemption from (or otherwise reduce),
or file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described in

case prepared in accordance with applicable Requirements of Laws);

 



 

(ii) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other
party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with _Section
8.1(b)_, and in connection therewith provide the other party necessary powers
of attorney;

 



 

(iii) cooperate fully in preparing for and conducting any audits of, or
disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of each Acquired
Company;

Interests or any Acquired Company for taxable periods for which the other may
have a Liability under this _Section 8.1_ and furnish the other with copies
of all correspondence received from any taxing authority in connection with
any Tax audit or information request with respect to any such taxable period.

 



 

(e) _Election under Section 338 for the Mexican Subsidiaries_. Buyers shall
make an election under Section 338 of the Code for each Mexican Subsidiary

Sellers Representative shall take all steps necessary to effect such
elections. The Allocation Schedule described in _Section 3.6(b)_ shall
include allocations among the assets of each Mexican Subsidiary.

 



 

(f) _Survival of Obligations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, and notwithstanding _Section 13.1_ of this Agreement, the
obligations of the parties set forth in this _Section 8.1_ shall be
unconditional and absolute and shall remain in effect without limitation as to
time.

 



 

 **8.2.** ** ****_Employees and Employee Benefit Plans_**.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing Date and ending on the date
which is 12 months from the Closing Date (or if earlier, the date of the
employees termination of employment with the Acquired Companies), Buyers
shall, or shall cause the Acquired Companies to provide the Continuing
Employees, in the aggregate, with aggregate cash compensation (i.e., salary,
wages and bonus opportunity) and material employee benefits not materially
less favorable than the aggregate cash compensation (i.e., salary, wages and
bonus opportunity) and material employee benefits provided by the Acquired
Companies to all Continuing Employees, in the aggregate, immediately prior to
the Closing. The foregoing is understood not to apply to Continuing Employees
under the Employment Agreements, whose terms and conditions of employment
shall be governed by those Agreements and not this _Section 8.2(a)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Sellers shall (i) cause the Acquired Companies to take all actions
necessary or appropriate to continue the sponsorship of, and participation in,
the Victory 401(k) Plan through the Closing Date, (ii) take all actions
necessary or appropriate to cause Leedo to cease participating in the Victory
401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date, and (iii) cause the Acquired Companies to
take all actions necessary or appropriate to address the items listed on
_Schedule 8.2(b)_ prior to the Closing Date to Buyers reasonable
satisfaction.

 



 

(c) This _Section 8.2_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 8.2_,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 8.2_. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish,
amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (ii)
shall alter or limit the ability of Buyers or the Acquired Companies or any of
their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the terms set forth in this _Section 8.2_ shall not create any right in any
Acquired Company employee or any other Person to any continued employment with
any Acquired Company, Buyers or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

ARTICLE XI

 



 

INDEMNIFICATION

 



 

 **11.1.** ** ****_Indemnification by Sellers_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this _Article XI_ and
_Section 13.1_, the Sellers jointly and severally agree to defend, indemnify
and hold harmless each Buyer Group Member from and against any and all Losses
and Expenses incurred by such Buyer Group Member (whether or not such Losses
and Expenses involve a Third Person Claim (as defined below)) in connection
with or arising from:

 



 

(i) (A) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of
a Seller contained or referred to in this Agreement as of the date hereof and
as if such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing
(except for representations and warranties that expressly relate to a
specified date, the inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with
reference to such specified date), or (B) any inaccuracy in any certificate
delivered by or on behalf of Sellers pursuant hereto (in each case, for
purposes of determining the amount of any Loss, without giving effect to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications limiting the
scope of such representation, warranty or certification);

 



 

(ii) any breach by the Sellers Representative of any of its covenants or
agreements or any failure of the Sellers Representative to perform any of its
obligations contained or referred to in this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) any Transaction Expenses in excess of the Closing Date Transaction
Expenses as set forth in the Accounting Report;

 



 

(iv) any Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies in the aggregate in excess of
the Closing Date Indebtedness as set forth in the Accounting Report;

 



 

(v) any breach by either Seller of any of its covenants or agreements, or any
failure of a Seller to perform any of its obligations, in this Agreement or
the Non-Competition Agreement;

 



 

(vi) the Restructuring and any Liabilities resulting from the Restructuring;
or

 



 

(vii) the matters described on _Schedule 11.1(a)(vi)_ ;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that:

 



 

(A) each Seller shall not be required to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
under clause (i) of this _Section 11.1(a)_ with respect to Losses and
Expenses incurred by Buyer Group Members (other than Losses and Expenses
incurred with respect to inaccuracies of the representations and warranties
contained in _Sections 5.1(a), (c)  (e)_, _5.2(a)_ , _5.6(e)(i)_ , the last

 



      
 

 



 

sentence of _5.7_ , _5.13_ and _5.23_ (collectively, the " _Sellers 
Fundamental Representations_"), as to which this proviso shall have no effect)
until the aggregate amount of such Losses and Expenses subject to
indemnification by Sellers exceeds $3,000,000 (the " _Basket_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that once the amount of the Basket is exceeded, each Seller shall
defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Group Members from the aggregate
amount of all Losses and Expenses otherwise recoverable under this _Article
XI_, irrespective of the Basket; _provided further_ , no Seller shall be
liable for any individual Loss or Expense (or series of related Losses or
Expenses) otherwise recoverable under _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ which does not
exceed $25,000 (which Loss or Expense shall not be counted towards the other
limits in this _subclause (A)_ and the following _subclause (B)_ ); and

 



 

(B) in no event shall the aggregate amount required to be paid by Sellers
pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ exceed $40,000,000 (other than Losses and
Expenses incurred with respect to inaccuracies of the Sellers Fundamental
Representations, which Losses and Expenses shall be limited to the Purchase
Price).

 



 

(b) The indemnification provided for in _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ shall terminate
when the applicable representation or warranty terminates in accordance with
_Section 13.1_ (and no claims shall be made by any Buyer Group Member under
_Section 11.1(a)(i)_ thereafter), except that the indemnification by Sellers
shall continue as to:

 



 

(i) the Sellers Fundamental Representations, as to which such representations
and warranties shall expire on the date that is 60 days after the lapse of the
longest applicable statute of limitations, including any extensions thereof
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes all statutes of limitations
applicable to the underlying claim);

 



 

(ii) the representations and warranties of the Sellers contained in _Section
5.6_ shall expire on the date that is 60 days after the lapse of the longest
applicable statute of limitations, including any extensions thereof (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, includes all statutes of limitations applicable to
the underlying claim); and

 



 

(iii) any Loss or Expense of which any Buyer Group Member has notified Sellers
in accordance with the requirements of _Section 11.3_ on or prior to the date
such indemnification obligation would otherwise terminate in accordance with
this _Section 11.1_, as to which the obligation of Sellers shall continue
until the liability of Sellers shall have been determined pursuant to this
_Article XI_, and , if applicable, Sellers shall have reimbursed all Buyer
Group Members for the full amount of such Loss and Expense in accordance with
this _Article XI_.

 



 

The indemnification provided for in this _Section 11.1_ other than _Section
11.1(a)(i)_ shall survive indefinitely, except as otherwise provided in
_Section 13.1_. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto hereby agree
and acknowledge that the survival periods set forth in this _Section 11.1(b)_
and in _Section 13.1_ are contractual statutes of limitations and any claim
brought by any party

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this _Article XI_ must be brought or filed prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period.

 



 

(c) Except for any payment required by _Section 3.4(b)_, the Buyer Group
Members shall first look to satisfy the amount of any indemnification
obligation provided for in this _Section 11.1_ from the Escrow Funds then
remaining in the Escrow Account (and held by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with _Section 3.7_ and the Escrow Agreement) and not subject to any Pending
Claims. If any such Escrow Funds, excluding any portion thereof subject to a
Pending Claim, are insufficient to satisfy in full any such indemnification
obligation, then, subject to any applicable limitations set forth in this
_Article XI_, Buyers shall be entitled to proceed against the applicable
Sellers to satisfy the remainder of such indemnification obligation.

 



 

 **11.2.** ** ****_Indemnification by Buyers_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this _Article XI_ and
_Section 13.1_, Buyers agree, jointly and severally, to defend, indemnify and
hold harmless each Sellers Group Member from and against any and all Losses
and Expenses incurred by such Sellers Group Member (whether or not such Losses
and Expenses involve a Third Person Claim (as defined below)) in connection
with or arising from:

 



 

(i) (A) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of
Buyers contained or referred to in this Agreement as of the date hereof and as
if such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing (except
for representations and warranties that expressly relate to a specified date,
the inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with reference to such
specified date) or (B) any inaccuracy in any certificate delivered by or on
behalf of Buyers pursuant hereto;

 



 

(ii) any breach by Buyers of any of their covenants or agreements or any
failure by Buyer to perform any of their obligations in this Agreement or the
Non-Competition Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) any third person claim arising out of any of the information provided or
other actions taken by or on behalf of the Sellers or the Acquired Companies
under _Section 7.1(b)_, including any claim arising out of the sole or
contributory negligence of such Person, except to the extent such claim
otherwise arises from a breach of any representation or warranty in _Article
V_ or a breach of any covenant of Sellers other than in _Section 7.1(b)_.

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that:

 



 

(A) Buyers shall not be required to defend, indemnify and hold harmless under
clause (i) of this _Section 11.2(a)_ with respect to Losses and Expenses
incurred by the Sellers Group Members (other than Losses and Expenses incurred
with respect to inaccuracies of the representations and warranties contained
in _Sections 6.1_ , _6.2(a)_ , _6.3_ , _6.5_ and _6.7_ (collectively, the "
_Buyers  Fundamental Representations_"), as to which this proviso shall have
no effect) until the aggregate amount of such Losses and Expenses subject to
indemnification by Buyers exceeds the amount of the Basket; _provided_ , that
once the amount of the Basket is exceeded, Buyers

 



      
 

 



 

shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers Group Members for the
aggregate amount of all Losses and Expenses otherwise recoverable under this
_Article XI_, irrespective of the Basket; _provided further_ , that Buyer
shall not be liable for any individual Loss or Expense (or series of related
Losses or Expenses) otherwise recoverable under _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ which
does not exceed $25,000 (which Loss or Expense shall not be counted towards
the other limits in this _subclause (A)_ and the following _subclause (B)_ );
and

 



 

(B) in no event shall the aggregate amount required to be paid by Buyers
pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ exceed $40,000,000 (other than Losses and
Expenses incurred with respect to inaccuracies of the Buyers Fundamental
Representations, which Losses and Expenses shall be limited to the Purchase
Price).

 



 

(b) The indemnification provided for in _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ shall terminate
when the applicable representation or warranty terminates in accordance with
_Section 13.1_ (and no claims shall be made by either Sellers Group Member
under _Section 11.2(a)_ thereafter), except that the indemnification by
Buyers shall continue as to:

 



 

(i) the Buyers Fundamental Representations, as to which such representations
and warranties shall expire on the date that is 60 days after the lapse of the
longest applicable statute of limitations, including any extensions thereof
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes all statutes of limitations
applicable to the underlying claim); and

 



 

(ii) any Loss or Expense of which either Sellers Group Member has notified
Buyers in accordance with the requirements of _Section 11.3_ on or prior to
the date such indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance with
this _Section 11.2_, as to which the obligation of Buyers shall continue
until the liability of Buyers shall have been determined pursuant to this
_Article XI_, and, if applicable, Buyers shall have reimbursed all Sellers
Group Members for the full amount of such Loss and Expense in accordance with
this _Article XI_.

 



 

The indemnification provided for in this _Section 11.2_ other than _Section
11.2(a)(i)_ shall survive indefinitely, except as otherwise provided in
_Section 13.1_. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto hereby agree
and acknowledge that the survival periods set forth in this _Section 11.1(b)_
and in _Section 13.1_ are contractual statutes of limitations and any claim
brought by any party pursuant to this _Article XI_ must be brought or filed
prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period.

 



 

 **11.3.** ** ****_Notice of Claims_**.

 



 

(a) Any Buyer Group Member or Sellers Group Member (each, an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") seeking indemnification hereunder (or believing in good faith that
it may suffer or incur Losses or Expenses for which it is or may be entitled
to indemnification hereunder) shall give to the party obligated to provide
indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") prompt notice
(a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise
to any claim for indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim
Notice (if then known) the

 



      
 

 



 

amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim, copies of all
written evidence thereof, and a reference to the provision of this Agreement
or any other agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in
connection herewith upon which such claim is based; _provided_ , that a Claim
Notice in respect of any pending or threatened action at law or suit in equity
by or against a third Person as to which indemnification will be sought (each
such action or suit being a " _Third Person Claim_ ") shall be given promptly
after the action or suit is commenced and in any event not later than 30 days
after the Indemnified Party receives written notice of such Third Person
Claim; _provided further_ that failure to give such notice shall not relieve
the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnitor shall have been actually prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
_Article XI_ shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) pursuant to _Section 13.15_; or
(iii) by any other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor
shall agree. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the
time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been
taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined.

 



 

 **11.4.** ** ****_Third Person Claims_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 11.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the defense,
compromise or settlement of any Third Person Claim against such Indemnified
Party as to which indemnification will be sought by any Indemnified Party from
any Indemnitor hereunder, and in any such case the Indemnitor shall cooperate
in all reasonable respects in connection therewith and shall furnish such
records, information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by
the Indemnified Party in connection therewith; _provided_ , that:

 



 

(i) the Indemnitor may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its
own expense, in the defense of any such Third Person Claim as to which the
Indemnified Party has so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof;
and

 



 

(ii) the Indemnified Party shall not, without the written consent of the
Indemnitor (which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), pay, compromise or settle any such Third Person Claim, except that
no such consent shall be required if, following a written request from the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnitor shall fail, within 14 days after the making
of such request, to acknowledge and agree in writing that, if such Third
Person Claim shall be adversely determined, such Indemnitor has an obligation
to provide indemnification hereunder to such Indemnified Party.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
pay, settle or compromise any such Third Person Claim without such consent,
_provided_ that in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to
indemnity therefor hereunder unless such consent is unreasonably withheld or
delayed. If the Indemnified Party does not elect to proceed with the defense
of any such Third Person Claim, the Indemnitor may proceed with the defense of
such Third Person Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor may not
settle, adjust or compromise any such Third Person Claim

 



      
 

 



 

without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent may
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



 

(b) If any Third Person Claim against any Indemnified Party (i) is solely for
money damages (and where Sellers are the Indemnitor, the potential liability
of Sellers exceeds the potential liability of Buyers thereunder), and (ii)
where Sellers are the Indemnitor, will have no continuing effect in any
material respect on the assets or properties or Business of the Acquired
Companies or the Interests, then the Indemnitor shall have the right to
conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise
or settlement of any such Third Person Claim against such Indemnified Party as
to which indemnification will be sought by any Indemnified Party from any
Indemnitor hereunder, and in any such case the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate in all reasonable respects in connection therewith and shall furnish
such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by
the Indemnitor in connection therewith; _provided_ , that the Indemnified
Party may participate, through counsel chosen by it, in the defense of any
such Third Person Claim as to which the Indemnitor has so elected to conduct
and control the defense thereof, the expenses of which participation shall,
unless there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnitor and the
Indemnified Party, be payable by the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing contained in this _Section 11.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to pay, settle or compromise any such Third Person Claim,
_provided_ , that in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to
indemnity therefor hereunder unless the Indemnified Party shall have sought
the consent of the Indemnitor to such payment, settlement or compromise and
such consent was unreasonably withheld or delayed, in which event no claim for
indemnity therefor hereunder shall be waived. The Indemnitor may not settle,
adjust or compromise any such Third Person Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

 



 

 **11.5.** ** ****_Setoff_**. Buyers shall have the right to withhold and
deduct any sum that is then owed to any Buyer Group Member or is reasonably
necessary to satisfy any pending claim of indemnification made by a Buyer
Group Member in good faith under this _Article XI_ from any amount otherwise
payable by any Buyer Group Member to either Seller (or Sellers Representative
on their behalf) under _Section 3.4_ or _3.5_ of this Agreement or to the
counterparties to the Employment Agreements under Exhibit A to such Employment
Agreements to the extent the Escrow Amount is insufficient or unavailable for
such claimed sum; _provided, however_ , that if pursuant to _Section 3.4_ or
_3.5_ or Exhibit A to such Employment Agreements, any amount is due and owing
to Sellers or the counterparties to the Employment Agreements, as applicable,
and Sellers are contesting a claim asserted in accordance with this Agreement,
any disputed portion of that claim which would be setoff against amount
otherwise due will be held in a third party escrow account pending resolution
of the dispute in accordance with the terms of this _Article XI_. For the
absence of doubt, Buyers have no such rights under this _Section 11.5_ as to
any portion payable under Exhibit A to the Employment Agreements to any
individuals who are not counterparties to the Employment Agreements.

 



 

 **11.6.** ** ****_Coordination with Tax Contests_**. If there shall be any
conflicts between the provisions of this _Article XI_ and _Section 8.1(c)_
(relating to Tax contests), the provisions of _Section 8.1(c)_ shall control
with respect to Tax contests.

 



 

 **11.7.** ** ****_Tax Benefits and Insurance Policies_**. Without limiting
the effect of any other limitation contained in this _Article XI_, for
purposes of computing the amount of any and all

 



      
 

 



 

Losses and Expenses recoverable under this _Article XI_, there shall be
deducted an amount equal to the amount of any insurance or other third party
proceeds actually received (net of any related costs, including deductibles
and premium adjustments) by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates in
connection with such Losses or Expenses (it being understood that the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain such proceeds). An indemnity payment hereunder with respect to any
Loss or Expense shall be calculated on an "after-tax basis," which shall mean
an amount which is sufficient to compensate the Indemnified Party for the
event giving rise to such Loss or Expense (the " _Indemnified Event_ "),
determined after taking into account (1) all increases in federal, state,
local or other Taxes (including estimated Taxes) payable by the Indemnified
Party as a result of the receipt of the indemnity payment (as a result of the
indemnity payment being included in income, resulting in a reduction of tax
basis, or otherwise), (2) to the extent not previously taken into account in
computing the amount of the such Loss or Expense, all increases in federal,
state, local and other Taxes (including estimated Taxes) payable by the
Indemnified Party as a result of the Indemnified Event for all affected
taxable years or periods, and (3) to the extent not previously taken into
account in computing the amount of such Loss or Expense, all reductions in
federal, state, local and foreign Taxes (including estimated Taxes) realized
by the Indemnified Party as a result of the Indemnified Event for all affected
taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date and, with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
and including the Closing Date. All calculations shall be made at the time of
the relevant indemnification payment using reasonable assumptions.

 



 

 **11.8.** ** ****_Adjustment to Purchase Price_**. Any payment by Buyers or
Sellers under this _Article XI_ shall, to the extent such payment can be
properly so characterized under applicable Tax law, be treated by the parties
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price (it being understood that if such
treatment is later disallowed in any administrative or court proceedings, the
Indemnitor shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Party for
the effects of such disallowance, and it being further understood that the
obligations under this parenthetical clause shall remain in effect without
limitation as to time).

 



 

 **11.9.** ** ****_Additional Limitations_**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 11.1(a)_
or _Section 11.1(b)_, the limitations set forth in _Section 11.1(a)_ and
_11.1(b)_ shall not apply in the event of any willful misconduct or actual
fraud.

 



 

(b) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification with respect to
punitive or exemplary damages, or for consequential damages that are not
reasonably foreseeable or are remote or speculative (in each case, excluding
amounts payable to a third party).

 



 

(c) Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take,
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss or Expense upon becoming
aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or
does, give rise thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , this _Section 11.9(c)_
shall not require any Indemnified Party to expend, or cause its Affiliates to
expend, any material funds (judged in light of the underlying matter) unless
such Indemnified Party is obligated to expend such funds (or cause its
Affiliates to expend such funds) by applicable Requirements of Law.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Losses may be claimed
under this _Article XI_ by any Indemnified Party to the extent such Losses
are specifically and explicitly included as a liability in the calculation of
any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.3_ or _Section
3.4_.

 



 

 **11.10.** ** ****_Exclusive Remedies_**. Except for willful misconduct or
actual fraud and other remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law and
injunctive and provisional relief (including specific performance), if the
Closing occurs, this _Article XI_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
breaches of this Agreement, either Seller Ancillary Agreement or any Buyer
Ancillary Agreement (including any covenant, obligation, representation or
warranty contained herein or therein, or in any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto or thereto and with respect to any and all claims by the Indemnified
Parties relating to this Agreement, the Seller Ancillary Agreements, the Buyer
Ancillary Agreements, the Acquired Companies, the events giving rise to or the
subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted under law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement it may have against the other parties hereto and their
Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or based

 **12.1.** ** ****_Termination_**. Anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing Date:

 



 

(a) by the mutual consent of Buyers and the Sellers Representative;

 



 

(b) by Buyers or Sellers Representative if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before 60 days after the date of this Agreement (or such later
date as may be mutually agreed to in writing by Buyers and Sellers) (the "
_Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the approvals of the
Governmental Bodies contemplated by _Section 7.3(c)_ have not been obtained
by the Outside Date and all other conditions to the Closing are satisfied or
capable of then being satisfied, the Outside Date may be extended by Buyers or
Sellers one or more times by written notice to the other party for additional
periods of time not to exceed 60 days in the aggregate. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Buyers nor Sellers shall be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 12.1(b)_ if the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein results from, or is caused by, a material
breach by such party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein;

 



 

(c) by Buyers in the event of any material breach by Sellers of any of
Sellers agreements, representations or warranties contained herein and the
failure of Sellers to cure such breach within 15 days after receipt of notice
from Buyers requesting such breach to be cured; or

 



 

(d) by Sellers Representative in the event of any material breach by Buyers
of any of Buyers agreements, representations or warranties contained herein
and the failure of Buyers to

 



      
 

 



 

cure such breach within 15 days after receipt of notice from Sellers
requesting such breach to be cured.

 



 

 **12.2.** ** ****_Notice of Termination_**. Any party desiring to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1_ shall give notice of such
termination to the other party to this Agreement.

 



 

 **12.3.** ** ****_Effect of Termination_**. If this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to this _Article XII_, all further obligations of the
parties under this Agreement (other than this _Section 12.3_ and _Sections
13.2_ and _13.3_ and the Confidentiality Agreement) shall be terminated
without further liability of any party to the other, provided that nothing
herein shall relieve any party from liability for actual fraud or any breach
of this Agreement prior to termination.

 



 

ARTICLE XIII

 



 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 



 

 **13.1.** ** ****_Survival of Obligations_**. All representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
except as otherwise provided in _Article XI_, the representations and
warranties contained in _Articles V_ and _VI_ shall terminate on the eighteen-
month anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 5.12(c)_ shall terminate
on the twelve-month anniversary of the Closing Date. All covenants, agreements
and obligations contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date
until, and will expire, in each case, in accordance with their terms or, where
no term is specified, on the date that is 60 days after the lapse of the
longest applicable statute of limitations, including any extensions thereof
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes all statutes of limitations
applicable to the underlying claim).

 



 

 **13.2.** ** ****_Confidential Nature of Information_**. Without limiting
Buyers obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, each party agrees
that it will treat in confidence all documents, materials and other
information which it shall have obtained regarding the other party during the
course of the negotiations leading to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether obtained before or after the date of this
Agreement), the investigation provided for herein and the preparation of this
Agreement and other related documents, and, if the transactions contemplated
hereby are not consummated, each party will return to the other party all
copies of nonpublic documents and materials which have been furnished in
connection therewith. Each Seller also covenants and agrees that, if Closing
occurs, it will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates to, divulge or
make use of any trade secrets or other confidential information of any
Acquired Company or the Business other than to disclose such secrets and
information to Buyers or their Affiliates. All such documents, materials and
information shall not be communicated to any third Person (other than, in the
case of Buyers, to its counsel, accountants, financial advisors or existing
and prospective lenders, prospective syndicate members or other prospective
participants in the Financing, and in the case of Sellers, to their counsel,
accountants or financial advisors). No other party shall use any confidential
information in any manner whatsoever except solely for the purpose of
evaluating the proposed purchase and sale of the Company Interests; _provided_
, _however_ , that after the Closing Buyers may use or disclose any
confidential information with respect to or about any Acquired Company or
otherwise reasonably related to the Business or the Interests. The obligation
of each party to treat documents, materials and other information which it
shall have obtained from the

 



      
 

 



 

other party in confidence shall not apply to any information which (i) is or
becomes available to such party from a source other than the other party, (ii)
is or becomes available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by
such party or its agents, (iii) is required to be disclosed under applicable
Requirements of Laws, but only to the extent it must be disclosed, or (iv)
such party reasonably deems necessary to disclose to obtain any of the
consents or approvals contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **13.3.** ** ****_No Public Announcement_**. The parties acknowledge that
they intend for there to be a public announcement regarding this Agreement
that is to be mutually agreed upon and that is to be issued before the opening
of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the next trading day after
execution and delivery of this Agreement and an investor conference call
hosted by Buyers. Each of Buyers and Sellers Representative shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or similar public
announcement pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, except as may be
required by Requirements of Laws or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange, in which case the party
proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other
party before issuing any such press releases or making any such public
announcements.

such party hereto without the written consent of the other parties, except

Agreement.

hours. Sellers shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred
by it pursuant to this _Section 13.6(a)_. If Buyers shall desire to dispose
of any of such books and records prior to the expiration of such six-year
period, Buyers shall, prior to such disposition, give Sellers a reasonable
opportunity, at Sellers expense, to segregate and remove such books

 



      
 

 



 

and records as Sellers may select. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Buyers nor the Acquired Companies shall be required to violate any obligation
of confidentiality, Court Order or Requirements of Law to which Buyers or any
Acquired Company is subject or to waive any privilege which any of them may
possess in discharging their obligations pursuant to this _Section 13.6(a)_
(it being understood that Buyers shall cause the Acquired Companies to take
reasonable actions to eliminate any such impediments to providing such
information).

 



 

(b) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Buyers and their
Representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
relating to the Interests, the Acquired Companies or the Business which
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates may retain after the Closing
Date. Such access shall be afforded by Sellers and their respective Affiliates
upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours.
Buyers shall be solely responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by it
pursuant to this _Section 13.6(b)_. If Sellers or any of their respective

the expiration of such six-year period, Sellers shall, prior to such
disposition, give Buyers a reasonable opportunity, at Buyers expense, to
segregate and remove such books and records as Buyers may select.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Seller shall be required to violate any
obligation of confidentiality, Court Order or Requirements of Law to which
either Seller is subject or to waive any privilege which any of them may
possess in discharging their obligations pursuant to this _Section 13.6(b)_
(it being understood that Sellers shall take reasonable actions to eliminate
any such impediments to providing such information).

 



 

 **13.7.** ** ****_Sellers  Representative_**.

 



 

(a) Each Seller irrevocably constitutes and appoints VPM as " _Sellers 
Representative_" to act as such Sellers true and lawful attorney-in-fact and
agent and authorizes Sellers Representative, acting for such Seller and in
such Sellers name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, to do and
perform every act and thing required or permitted to be done with respect to
all matters arising under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any other
Seller Ancillary Agreement. All actions taken by Sellers Representative
hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under any other Seller Ancillary
Agreement shall be binding upon all Sellers and their respective heirs,
estates, executors, personal representatives and successors and permitted
assigns as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them.
Sellers Representative shall take any and all actions which it believes are
necessary or appropriate under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
other Seller Ancillary Agreement for and on behalf of Sellers, as fully as if
Sellers were acting on their own behalf, including:

 



 

(i) receiving the Estimated Closing Date Cash Payment or any Earnout Payment
(including in each case any adjustments thereto) from Buyers and receiving on
behalf of Sellers any amounts disbursed pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and
distributing such funds in accordance with this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, as applicable;

 



 

(ii) participating in the adjustment, objection, resolution and other
processes or procedures pursuant to this Agreement or either Seller Ancillary
Agreement, including pursuant to _Articles III_ or _XI_ ;

 



 

(iii) initiating, consenting to, compromising or settling all indemnity claims
or obligations or taking any other actions on behalf of any and all Sellers
pursuant to _Article XI_;

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) initiating or taking any action with respect to any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement;

 



 

(v) executing and performing the Escrow Agreement or any other Seller
Ancillary Agreement in accordance with its terms;

 



 

(vi) taking any and all actions on behalf of Sellers from time to time as
Sellers Representative may deem necessary or desirable to fulfill the
interests and purposes of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other
Seller Ancillary Agreements and engaging agents and representatives (including
accountants and legal counsel) to assist in connection herewith and therewith;

 



 

(vii) taking any and all action on behalf of Sellers from time to time as
Sellers Representative may deem necessary or desirable to make or enter into
any waiver, amendment, agreement, opinion, certificate or other document
contemplated under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other Seller
Ancillary Agreement;

 



 

(viii) delivering all notices required to be delivered by either Seller; and

 



 

(ix) receiving all notices required to be delivered to either Seller.

 



 

No Seller may take any of the actions set forth in paragraphs _(i)_ through
_(ix)_ of this _Section 13.7(a)_ without the prior written consent of the
Sellers Representative.

 



 

(b) Each Seller grants unto said attorney-in-fact and agent full power and
authority to do and perform each and every act and thing necessary or
desirable to be done in connection with the matters described above, as fully
to all intents and purposes as such Seller might or could do in person, hereby
ratifying and confirming all that Sellers Representative may lawfully do or
cause to be done by virtue hereof. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Sellers Representative shall have full power and authority to
interpret all the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and any other Seller Ancillary Agreement and to consent to any amendment or
waiver hereof or thereof on behalf of all Sellers and their successors. Buyers
and the Escrow Agent are entitled and authorized to give notices only to
Sellers Representative for any notice contemplated by this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or any other Seller Ancillary Agreement to be given to either
Seller. A successor to Sellers Representative may be chosen by a majority in
interest of Sellers, _provided_ that notice thereof is given promptly by the
successor Sellers Representative to Buyers and the Escrow Agent and to each
Seller.

 



 

(c) The grant of authority provided for in this _Section 13.7_ (i) is coupled
with an interest and is being granted, in part, as an inducement to Buyers to
enter into this Agreement and shall be irrevocable and survive the death,
incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of either Seller and shall be binding
on any successor thereto, and (ii) shall survive any distribution from the
Escrow Agent.

 



 

(d) Sellers Representative shall not have by reason of this Agreement a
fiduciary relationship in respect of either Seller. Sellers Representative
shall not be liable to either Seller for any action taken or omitted by
Sellers Representative hereunder or under any other document hereunder, or in
connection therewith, except that Sellers Representative shall not be
relieved of any Liability imposed by Law for actual fraud, gross negligence or
willful

 



      
 

 



 

misconduct. Sellers Representative shall not be liable to either Seller for
any apportionment or distribution of payments made by Sellers Representative
in good faith, and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently
determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of either Seller to
whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to recover from other Sellers any
payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to have been
entitled. Sellers Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry
concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms,
provisions or conditions of this Agreement. Each Seller acknowledges and
agrees that Sellers Representative shall not be obligated to take any actions
and shall be entitled to take such actions as Sellers Representative deems
appropriate in Sellers Representatives sole discretion.

 



 

(e) Each Seller agrees that Buyers and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
rely on any decision, act, consent or instruction of Sellers Representative
on behalf of Sellers for purposes of all matters under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and any other Seller Ancillary Agreement (including for
purposes of all matters under _Articles III_ , and _IX_ ) and that each such
decision, act, consent or instruction shall be binding on each Seller and such
Sellers successors and permitted assigns as fully as if such Person had so
decided, acted, consented or instructed. None of Buyers or the Escrow Agent
(i) need be concerned with the authority of Sellers Representative to act on
behalf of a Seller hereunder or (ii) shall be held liable or accountable in
any manner for any act or omission of Sellers Representative in such
capacity.

 



 

 **13.8.** ** ****_Entire Agreement; Amendments_**. This Agreement and
Schedules referred to herein and the documents delivered pursuant hereto
contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard to the
subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings or letters of intent between or among any of the
parties hereto, including the Confidentiality Agreement. This Agreement shall
not be amended, modified or supplemented except by a written instrument signed
by an authorized representative of each of the Sellers Representative and
Buyers.

 



 

 **13.9.** ** ****_Partial Invalidity_**. Wherever possible, each provision
hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Requirements of Laws, but in case any one or more of the provisions
contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the
extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof,
unless such a construction would be unreasonable.

 



 

 **13.10.** ** ****_Waivers_**. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or
parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to Buyers,
it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of each Buyer, and
if, as to either Seller, by the Sellers Representative. Except as provided in
_Section 7.8(c)_, the failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any
provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such
provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part
hereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such
provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to
constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

 



       
 

 



 

 **13.11.** ** ****_Expenses_**. Except as otherwise provided herein, each
party hereto will pay all costs and expenses incident to its negotiation and
preparation of this Agreement and to its performance and compliance with all
agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to be performed or
complied with, including the fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel
and accountants.

 



 

 **13.12.** ** ****_Execution in Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an
original instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to Sellers and Buyers.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement
shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by
facsimile transmission or e-mail shall constitute effective execution and
delivery of this Agreement as to the parties and may be used in lieu of the
original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the parties transmitted by
facsimile or e-mail shall be deemed to be their original signatures for all
purposes.

 



 

 **13.13.** ** ****_Further Assurances_**. From time to time following the
Closing, each party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, to the other party such other documents and instruments as such
party may reasonably request or as may be otherwise necessary to more
effectively carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **13.14.** ** ****_Governing Law_**. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware,
except for any such laws that would require the application of the laws of any
other jurisdiction, including any applicable state and local laws pertaining
to Environmental matters at each location.

 



 

 **13.15.** ** ****_Resolution of Disputes_**. Following the Closing, any
dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or
the negotiation or breach, termination or validity thereof (a " _Dispute_ "),
shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration
Association (" _AAA_ ") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules,
and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration shall be held in New York,
New York and shall be conducted before a single arbitrator, independent of the
parties hereto and appointed from AAAs National Roster in accordance with
AAAs Commercial Arbitration Rules. The law applicable to the arbitration,
including the administration and enforcement thereof, shall be the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, and the law governing this Agreement. The
non-prevailing party in any arbitration shall bear the cost of the
arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and shall be
responsible for its own and the prevailing partys out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration. Each party shall bear
the cost of preparing and presenting its case. Limited discovery shall be
permitted prior to the arbitration hearing as follows: (i) exchange of witness
lists; (ii) exchange of documentary evidence and documents relating to or
arising out of the issues to be arbitrated; (iii) depositions of party
witnesses; and (iv) such other depositions as may be allowed by the arbitrator
upon a showing of good cause. Depositions shall be conducted in accordance
with the Federal Code of Civil Procedure. The arbitration award (the " _Award_
") shall be presented to the parties in writing, and upon request of either
Buyers or the Sellers Representative, shall specify the factual and legal
bases for the Award. The judgment upon any Award rendered in such arbitration
shall be binding on the parties and may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction in accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 13.17_. The Award may be confirmed and enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction. Any post-Award proceedings shall be governed by the
Federal Arbitration Act. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each of Buyers,
Sellers or the Sellers Representative may, without inconsistency with this
arbitration provision, apply to any court having jurisdiction in accordance
with _Section 13.17_ with respect to (i) any Dispute, controversy or claim
based upon any willful misconduct, intentional misrepresentation or actual
fraud, and (ii) interim provisional, injunctive or other equitable relief
until the Award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Except
as required by applicable Requirements of Law and except as necessary in court
proceedings to enforce this arbitration provision or any Award, or to obtain
relief with respect to a matter described in the immediately preceding
sentence, neither Buyers, Sellers, the Sellers Representative nor an
arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration
hereunder without the prior written consent of Buyers and the Sellers
Representative.

 



 

 **13.16.** ** ****_Time is of the Essence_**. With respect to all dates and
time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the
essence.

 



 

 **13.17.** ** ****_Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_**. The
parties hereby irrevocably submit in any suit, action or proceeding arising
out of or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York and any court of the State of New
York located in the County of New York and waive any and all objections to
jurisdiction that they may have under any applicable law or any claim or
objection that any such court is in an inconvenient forum. EACH OF THE PARTIES
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



 

 **13.18.** ** ****_Claims Against Debt Financing Sources_**. Subject to the
rights of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letters under the terms thereof,
none of the parties hereto shall have any rights or claims against the
lenders, any other financing sources of the Financing or any Affiliate thereof
(collectively, the " _Debt Financing Sources_ "), solely in their respective
capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the Financing, and the
Debt Financing Sources, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or
arrangers, shall not have any rights or claims against any party hereto or any
related person thereof, in connection with this Agreement or the Financing,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Without limiting
the foregoing and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
each of the parties hereto waives any right to trial by jury in respect of any
such claim, suit, action or proceeding. The provisions of this Section, as
well as _Section 12.3_ and _Section 13.17_, shall be enforceable by each
Debt Financing Source, its Affiliates and their respective successors and
permitted assigns as express third-party beneficiaries.

 



 

 **13.19.** ** ****_Privileged Communications_**.

 



 

(a) Sellers and Buyers hereby acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement, neither Buyers nor any of their Affiliates shall
have access to (and each hereby waives any right of access it may otherwise
have with respect to) any Privileged Communications, whether or not the
Closing occurs. Without limiting the generality of the

 



      
 

 



 

foregoing, Buyers hereby acknowledge and agree, upon and after the Closing:
(i) neither Buyers nor any of their Affiliates shall be a holder of, or have
any right, title or interest to the Privileged Communications; (ii) only
Sellers shall hold property rights in the Privileged Communications and shall
have the right to waive or modify such property rights; and (iii) Sellers
shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any Privileged
Communications to Buyers or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyers or their Affiliates from
requesting, using or accessing any such communications in connection with
document production requests or discovery in any third party litigation,
arbitration or other legal proceeding so long as such communications would not
be subject to an attorney-client privilege if they were being requested in a
litigation, arbitration or other legal proceeding by an unrelated third party
and such communications are produced or required to be produced in response to
such document production requests or discovery.

 



 

(b) To the extent that any Privileged Communications is disclosed or made
available to Buyers, the parties hereto hereby agree (i) that the disclosure,
receipt and/or review of such Privileged Communication is entirely inadvertent
and shall not waive, modify, limit or impair in any form or fashion the
protected nature of the Privileged Communications, (ii) it is their desire,
intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not
intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality
of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege, and (iii)
Sellers shall have the right in their sole discretion and at any time to
require the return and/or destruction of the Privileged Communications.
