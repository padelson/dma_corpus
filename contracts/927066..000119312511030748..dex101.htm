_Purchaser_ "), DVA Acquisition Company, a Delaware corporation (" _Merger
Sub_ ") and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser, CDSI I Holding
Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and CDSI
Representative LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "
_Representative_ "), as representative of the Stockholders (as defined below).

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Company, Purchaser and
Merger Sub have each determined that the merger of Merger Sub with and into
the Company upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement is
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of their stockholders and have
approved the Merger (as defined below), and the board of directors of
the Company has resolved to recommend that the Stockholders (as defined
below) approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, as inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and incur the
obligations set forth herein, following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company will obtain and deliver to Purchaser the written
consent, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A-1_ , of Stockholders listed
on _Exhibit A-2_ hereto (the " _Principal Stockholders_ "), representing more
than 50% of the issued and outstanding Shares (as defined below) as of the
date hereof, pursuant to which this Agreement and the Merger and the other
Contemplated Transactions (as defined below) shall be approved and adopted in
accordance with Section 251(c) of the DGCL (as defined below) (the "
_Principal Stockholder Consents_ ").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the Parties agree as follows (certain capitalized terms used herein

Legal Requirements of the State of Delaware (the " _Merger_ ") as provided in
the Certificate of Merger in substantially the form of _Exhibit B_ attached
hereto (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") which provides, among other matters,
as follows:

(a) _Surviving Corporation_. From and after the Effective Time, the Company,

(the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). Following the Merger, the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Surviving Corporation shall
without other transfer succeed to all the rights and property, subject to all

Corporation itself had incurred them.

 



1 (b) _Certificate of Incorporation_. From and after the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended as a result of
the Merger so as to read in its entirety as the certificate of incorporation
of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Merger except that Article I
thereof shall be amended to reflect the name of the Surviving Corporation as
determined by Purchaser and as so amended shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until duly amended as provided
therein or by applicable Legal Requirements.

(c) _By-Laws_. From and after the Effective Time, the by-laws of Merger Sub
shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended.

(d) _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the
directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving
Corporation, to serve, in both cases, until their successors shall have been
elected and qualified or until otherwise provided by applicable Legal
Requirement, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(e) _Shares of Merger Sub_. By virtue of the Merger and without any action of
the holder thereof, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

1.2 _Conversion of the Shares_.

(a) As of the Closing Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Purchaser, the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of

Subsidiary of the Company, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective
Time (" _Treasury Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and retired and cease to
exist, and no cash, securities or other property shall be payable in respect
thereof;

8 (i) In connection with preparing the Closing Net Working Capital

Statement: (A) a schedule (the " _Closing Reference Net Working Capital
Schedule_ ") which shall set forth the Adjusted Net Working Capital as of the
date of the Reference Balance Sheet in accordance with the Accounting
Principles (the " _Closing Reference Adjusted Net Working Capital_ "); and (B)
a schedule (the " _Closing Net Working Capital Schedule_ ") which shall set
forth the Adjusted Net Working Capital as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with the Accounting Principles (the " _Closing
Adjusted Net Working Capital_ "). The Closing Statement, Closing Reference Net
Working Capital Schedule and the Closing Net Working Capital Schedule shall
be prepared in good faith and in accordance with the definitions included
herein and on a basis consistent with the Accounting Principles.

 

(b) The Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_
shall be deemed to be accepted as final by the Parties and shall be
conclusive for the purposes of this Agreement, except to the extent, if any,
that the Representative delivers, no later than the thirtieth (30th) day
following the date the Representative receives the Closing Statement, Closing
Reference Net Working Capital Schedule and the Closing Net Working Capital
Schedule, a written statement (an " _Objection Notice_ ") to Purchaser
describing the Representatives objections thereto (the " _Disputed Items_
"), specifying the amount in dispute and setting forth the basis for such
dispute.

(c) Subject to _Section 2.5(b)_, Purchaser and its representatives, on the
one hand, and the Representative and its representatives, on the other hand,
will use reasonable best efforts to resolve any Disputed Items in good faith,
but if they do not obtain a final resolution within thirty (30) calendar days
after receipt by Purchaser of any Objection Notice, the Representative and
Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days thereafter (or such earlier
date as mutually agreed), submit such dispute to Duff and Phelps LLC to serve as
the "Arbitrating Accountant" hereunder (the " _Arbitrating Accountant_ "). The
Arbitrating Accountant shall resolve all remaining Disputed Items in
accordance herewith within thirty (30) Business Days from the date of its
designation. In connection with the foregoing, the Arbitrating Accountant
shall be instructed to and must (i) limit its determination(s) only to the
remaining Disputed Items, (ii) make its determination(s) as to each remaining
Disputed Item based upon the definitions hereof and application of the
Accounting Principles and (iii) not assign a value to any remaining Disputed
Item greater than the higher value for such Disputed Item claimed by either
Purchaser or the Representative or less than the lower value for such Disputed
Item claimed by Purchaser or the Representative. The fees, costs and expenses
of the Arbitrating Accountant shall be allocated to and borne by Purchaser and
the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) based on the inverse of the
percentage that the Arbitrating Accountants determination (before
such allocation) bears to the total amount of the Disputed Items as
originally submitted to the Arbitrating Accountant. For example, should the
Disputed Items total in amount to $1,000 and the Arbitrating Accountant awards
$600 in favor of the Representatives position, 60% of the costs of its
review would be borne by Purchaser and 40% of the costs would be borne by the
Representative. Purchaser and the Representative shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Arbitrating Accountant to render a written determination
(which shall also include allocation of the Arbitrating Accountants costs and
expenses in accordance with the preceding sentences (" _Dispute Report_ "))
within 

 



9  thirty (30) Business Days after its retention, and Purchaser, the
Representative and their respective agents shall cooperate with the
Arbitrating Accountant during its engagement. Further, the Arbitrating
Accountants determination shall be based solely on the submissions by
Purchaser and the Representative and shall be in accordance with the terms and
procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of
an independent review). The determination of the Arbitrating Accountant shall
be conclusive and binding on the Parties for purposes of this _Section 2.5_,
absent fraud or manifest or mathematical error.

 

(d) Upon the agreement of Purchaser and the Representative or the decision of
the Arbitrating Accountant, the Closing Statement, as so adjusted (or, if the
Representative fails to deliver an Objection Notice within the thirty (30) day
period provided in _Section 2.5(b)_, the Closing Statement as delivered by
Purchaser), shall be deemed to be the Closing Statement for purposes of
calculating the Final Adjustment Amount (the " _Final Closing Statement_ ").
Within five (5) Business Days after the Merger Consideration is finally
determined pursuant to this  _Section 2.5_ (such finally determined Merger
Consideration, the " _Final Merger Consideration_ "):

(i) if the Final Merger Consideration is greater than the Estimated Merger
Consideration, Purchaser shall pay, or provide funds to the Paying Agent to
pay, to the Representative or its designee (on behalf of the Stockholders
and, to the extent applicable, the Contingent Payees) an amount equal to the
difference between the Final Merger Consideration and the Estimated Merger
Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Final Merger Consideration
exceeds the Estimated Merger Consideration by an amount equal to or less than
$500,000, no payment shall be made; or

(ii) if the Estimated Merger Consideration is greater than the Final Merger
Consideration, Purchaser and the Representative shall instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay to Purchaser from the Escrow Account an amount equal to the
difference between the Estimated Merger Consideration and the Final Merger
Consideration, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Estimated Merger
Consideration exceeds the Final Merger Consideration by an amount equal to or
less than $500,000, no payment shall be made.

(e) Any payment to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ (the " _Final
Adjustment Amount_ ") shall be increased by an amount equal to the product of
such payment multiplied by a rate per annum equal to the prime rate of
interest reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the Closing Date, calculated
on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over three hundred sixty
(360), from the Closing Date to the date of payment.

(f) Any Final Adjustment Amount that is paid pursuant to this _Section 2.5_
shall be treated by all parties for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration. Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to withhold Taxes on payments pursuant to this
Agreement in accordance with applicable Legal Requirement. Any sum which is
withheld and paid to a Tax authority as permitted by this _Section 2.5_ will
be deemed for purposes of this Agreement to have been paid to the Person with
regard to whom it is withheld.

 



10 (g) In connection with the provisions of this _Section 2.5_, Purchaser and
the Surviving Corporation shall make available to the Representative and its
accountants and other representatives all pertinent information, books and
records and work papers related to the preparation of the Closing Statement.

inquires of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries and
their respective accountants regarding questions concerning or disagreements
with the Closing Statement arising in the course of their review thereof, and
Purchaser shall use its, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
use their reasonable best efforts to cause any such accountants to cooperate
with and respond promptly to such inquiries.

Representative is entitled to receive (on behalf of the Stockholders) any
amounts hereunder or pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (including, without
limitation, pursuant to _Sections 2.5(d)(i)_ or _5.27_ of this Agreement or
Sections 3(b), 3(d) or 3(e)(vii) of the Escrow Agreement) (each such payment,
a " _Post-Closing Payment_ ") the Representative shall:

(a) promptly prepare and deliver to Purchaser a schedule (the " _Post-Closing
Payment Schedule_ ") setting forth (i) the name of each holder of Converted
Equity Securities, and with respect to each such holder, (1) the estimated
number of and type of Converted Equity Securities held by such Person, and (2)
the aggregate Allocated Post-Closing Payment to which such holder is entitled
in respect thereof, and (ii) the Post-Closing Contingent Payment Amount, if
any, to which each Contingent Payee is entitled in respect thereof and the
name of each such Contingent Payee. In addition, the Post-Closing Payment
Schedule shall, with respect to the Allocated Post-Closing Payment for the
Converted Company Options, set forth the amount of Taxes, if any, that will be
withheld therefrom; and then

(b) distribute (or direct to be distributed) in respect of each Converted
Equity Security its applicable Allocated Post-Closing Payment, if any, with

(d) Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the
Effective Time, represented Common Shares shall be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence the right to receive only such
portion of the Merger Consideration as is determined pursuant to this
Agreement. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. If any
Merger Consideration is to be paid to any Person other than to the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a
condition precedent to the payment thereof that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
transfer of such Certificate or the payment of Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to
the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



12 (e) Upon the later to occur of (i) six (6) months after the Payment Fund was
deposited with the Paying Agent, and (ii) written direction from the
Representative to the Paying Agent, any then undistributed portion of the
Payment Fund shall be delivered to the Representative, and the holders of
Converted Company Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article
2_ , shall thereafter, in each case, look only to the Representative for
payment of the Merger Consideration (as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.5_)
in respect of such Converted Company Shares, subject to escheat and abandoned
property and similar Legal Requirements.

2.9 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Purchaser shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to _Article 1_ or  _Article 2_ hereof such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law to the extent (i) such
amounts are designated as compensatory for Tax purposes by the Company upon
written notice to Purchaser on or prior to the Closing Date (or with respect
to payments from the Escrow Account, designated as compensatory for Tax
purposes by the Representative upon written notice to Purchaser on or prior
to release from the Escrow Account), which written notice shall be binding and
conclusive absent manifest error, (ii) the Company has not complied with the
provisions of _Section 5.16_ or (iii) required by Legal Requirement if the
Purchaser has provided written notice of the obligation to withhold to the
Company at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing (or release from
the Escrow Account). To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate Governmental Body by the Company, Purchaser and/or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. With respect to
any amounts described in clause (i), the Surviving Corporation shall
effectuate such withholding through payroll.

 

2.10 _Additional Matters Relating to the Merger Consideration_. It is
understood and agreed among the Parties that all calculations made pursuant
to this _Article 2_ will be rounded to five decimal places (it being
understood that all aggregate cash payments required to be made hereunder
shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent after giving effect to
the calculations made pursuant to this _Article 2_ ). However,
notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in all cases, the
amount payable to each Stockholder in respect of all Converted Equity
Securities held by such Stockholder shall be aggregated, and rounded to the
nearest $.01.

creations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger.

(c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions by the Company will not, require any Consent of, or filing with

respect to each Joint Venture, whether the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

posting of security with respect to a Benefit Plan or the imposition of
any material Encumbrance on the assets of any of the Acquired Companies under
ERISA or the Code. Except as set forth in _Part 3.11(e)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, with respect to any Benefit Plan, no prohibited
transaction under ERISA or the Code, for which an

subject any of the Acquired Companies or any trustee or fiduciary of any
Benefit Plan to the tax or penalty imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502 of ERISA.

(f) No Benefit Plan is (i) a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "); (ii) a
"multiple employer plan" as defined in Section 413(c) of the Code; or (iii)
subject to Title IV of ERISA. None of the Acquired Companies or any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA which has not
been satisfied in full or is reasonably likely to incur such liability. No
Benefit Plan covers any employee, officer, director or consultant of the
Acquired Companies outside of the United States.

 

(g) Except as set forth in _Part 3.11(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
or as contemplated by this Agreement or required under applicable Legal
Requirement, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions (either alone or in combination
with any other event, including, without limitation, a termination of
employment) will (i) result in, cause the accelerated vesting or delivery of,
or materially increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to, any
current or former employee, director or consultant of the Acquired Companies
or (ii) result in the payment of any other benefits or the forgiveness of any
Indebtedness of any current or former employee, director or consultant of the
Acquired Companies. Except as set forth in _Part 3.11(g)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (which may be updated by the Company prior to the
Closing upon reasonable notice to Purchaser), the Contemplated Transactions

5.4(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, provided that, for the avoidance
of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to expend any money,
(other than nominal amounts), commence litigation or pay or grant any
other form of compensation to any such Person in connection with obtaining
such Persons Consent.

(e) The Company, Merger Sub, and Purchaser shall cooperate with one another
in determining whether any notice or Consent is required under any Material
Contract in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions
(collectively, the " _Contract Consents_ ") and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such Contract Consents prior to
the Closing Date, provided that, for the

 



43  avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to expend any
money, (other than nominal amounts), commence litigation or pay or grant any
other form of compensation to any such Person in connection with obtaining
such Persons Consent. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an
attempt to assign any Contract that is by its terms not assignable without the
consent of the other party thereto. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide access to medical directors identified by
Purchaser and otherwise assist and, upon the Companys timely notice,
participate along with Purchaser in the negotiations with such identified
medical directors regarding their medical director agreements.

5.5 _Publicity_. The initial press release to be made at signing with respect
to this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions shall be a joint press
release in such form as agreed by the Company and Purchaser. Prior to the
Closing, subject to applicable Legal Requirements, the Company and
Purchaser shall consult with each other, and use reasonable best efforts to
agree upon the text of any press release or public statement, before issuing
any such press release or otherwise making public statements with respect to
the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions. At Closing the parties shall
issue a joint press release in such form as agreed by the Company and
Purchaser. After the Closing, subject to applicable Legal Requirements, the
Purchaser and the Representative shall consult with each other, and use
reasonable best efforts to agree upon the text of any press release or public
statement, before issuing any such press release or otherwise making public
statements with respect to the matters set forth on _Schedule K_  hereto.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall restrict
any of the Stockholders or any of their Affiliates from disclosing its or
their investment in, or information with respect to the performance of or
realization on, their investment in the Acquired Companies.

5.6 _Further Action_. Each of the Parties shall, subject to the fulfillment
at or before the Closing Date of each of the conditions of performance set
forth herein or the waiver thereof, use (subject to such lower standard of
efforts where specifically set forth in this Agreement) its reasonable best
efforts to perform such further acts and execute such documents as may be
reasonably required to effect the Contemplated Transactions. Each of the
Parties will comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal
Requirements in connection with its execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 5.6_ shall be deemed to affect or otherwise impose
any additional obligation on any Party in respect of any matter related to
pursuing or obtaining any Antitrust Approval.

5.7 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions, including the Merger, shall be paid by the Party incurring such
expenses except as otherwise expressly provided herein. It is understood and
agreed by the Parties that (a) any filing fees required pursuant to the HSR
Act shall be paid by Purchaser and (b) any and all reasonable fees, costs and
expenses incurred by the Acquired Companies in connection with
their cooperation with Purchaser and Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 5.4(b)_
and in connection with fulfilling their obligations pursuant to _Section
5.4(a)_ shall be borne by Purchaser. Purchaser shall promptly, and in any
event within three (3) Business Days following the submission to Purchaser of

 



44  reasonably documented invoices relating to such fees, costs and expenses,
reimburse any such Person for such amounts.

5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each Party shall give prompt notice to
each other Party of the status of matters relating to completion of the
Merger, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by such Party from any Governmental Body or
other third party with respect to this Agreement or Contemplated Transactions,
including the Merger.

 

5.9 _Access to Information_.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date or earlier termination of this
Agreement, the Company will provide Purchaser and its officers, counsel,
accountants, financial advisors, agents and other representatives with access
to the operations of the Company, its principal personnel and representatives,
and such books and records pertaining to the Acquired Companies, in each case,
as Purchaser may reasonably request during normal business hours and at its
sole expense; _provided_ that (i) Purchaser agrees that such access will give
due regard to minimizing interference with the operations, activities and
employees of the Company, (ii) such access and disclosure would not violate
the terms of any agreement to which any Acquired Company is bound (including
confidentiality agreements) or any applicable Legal Requirement (including
potential violations of Antitrust Law), (iii) may not adversely affect
the attorney-client privilege of the Acquired Companies or their respective
Affiliates, (iv) all arrangements for access shall be made in advance, solely
through specified persons at the Company or other authorized representatives,
(v) such access does not relate to the disclosure of personnel records of the
Company or its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation
records, medical histories or other information which, in the Companys good
faith opinion (after consultation with legal counsel), would be reasonably
likely to subject the Company or its Subsidiary to liability pursuant to
applicable Legal Requirements, and (vi) such access does not include any
invasive environmental investigations, testing or sampling without the
Companys written consent (which can be withheld in its sole discretion).

 

(b) Purchaser agrees that, except as otherwise explicitly set forth in this
Agreement, all information so received from the Company shall be deemed
received pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement dated July 20, 2009, as
amended as of September 21, 2010, between DSI Renal, Inc. and Purchaser (as
amended, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and that each shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and each of its and their representatives to, comply with
the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to such
information, and the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby
incorporated herein by reference with the same effect as if fully set forth in
this Agreement.

5.10 _Directors and Officers Indemnification; Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and
hold harmless each present and former director and officer or similar
functionary of the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective predecessor parent entities (when acting in such

 



45  capacity) (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "), against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection
with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified Persons service
as an officer or director of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective predecessor parent entities at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted under the DGCL or other applicable Legal
Requirement, as applicable. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding,
Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
advance expenses as incurred in the defense of any Legal Proceeding to the
fullest extent permitted under the DGCL or other applicable Legal
Requirement, _provided_ that any Indemnified Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, except as may be
required by any applicable Legal Requirement, Purchaser and the Company agree
that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Person as provided in the Organizational Documents of the Company
or its Subsidiaries or in any indemnification agreement between such
Indemnified Person and the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) shall
continue in full force and effect, and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any Indemnified
Persons right to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto.

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Purchaser shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute policies
or purchase, in either case, of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in the
aggregate to the Indemnified Persons than such current policy with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall not be required to pay with respect
to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year annual premiums
in excess of 150% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant
hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount. At the Purchasers option, the Company shall
purchase, at Purchasers expense, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year
prepaid "tail" or runoff policy on terms and conditions (in both amount and
scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters
arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the
Contemplated Transactions. The provisions of the first sentence of this
_Section 5.10(c)_ shall be deemed to have been satisfied if a prepaid "tail"
or runoff policy has been obtained prior to the Effective Time. If such a
prepaid "tail" or runoff policy has been obtained prior to the Effective Time,
Purchaser shall cause such policy to be 

 



46  maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall, and shall
cause their Subsidiaries to, (i) upon the written request of an Indemnified
Person, make any claim for coverage under any such policy to obtain
reimbursement for covered Losses or liabilities under any such policy, (ii)
promptly inform the Indemnified Person of any communication received by
Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries in
connection with the Indemnified Persons claim from, or given by Purchaser or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to, any Person issuing
any such insurance policy, (iii) permit the Indemnified Person to review any
written communication from any such insurance provider in connection with the
Indemnified Persons claim and permit the Indemnified Person a reasonably
opportunity to review, before submission, any written communication to such
insurance provider in connection with the Indemnified Persons claim, (iv)
provide the Indemnified Person a reasonable opportunity to consult with
Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries in
advance of any meeting or conference with such insurance provider and, to the
extent permitted by such insurance provider, give the Indemnified Person a
reasonable opportunity to attend and participate, and (v) upon the
Indemnified Persons reasonable request, furnish to the Indemnified Person a
certificate of insurance evidencing such policy.

(e) If Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of the consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.10_.

 

(f) This right to the indemnity shall be in addition to any rights that any
Indemnified Person may have at common law or otherwise and shall remain in
full force and effect following the Closing. Each of the parties hereto hereby
acknowledges that certain Indemnified Persons have certain rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by certain
current and former affiliated entities of the Company, including equity
holders and their respective Affiliates and each of their respective
stockholders, directors, managers, officers, controlling Persons, partners
(limited and/or general), members and employees (excluding the Company and
all of its Subsidiaries, collectively, the " _Other Indemnitors_ ") and hereby
agrees that (i) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
are the indemnitors of first resort (it being understood, for the avoidance
of doubt, that such parties obligations to the Indemnified Persons hereunder
are primary and any obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or
to provide indemnification (including without limitation, through director
and officer insurance policies) for the same expenses or liabilities incurred
by the Indemnified Persons are secondary), (ii) the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall be required to advance the full amount
of expenses incurred by such Indemnified Persons and shall be liable for the
full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in
settlement to the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of
this Agreement (or any other

 



47  agreement between the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof and
such Indemnified Persons), without regard to any rights such Indemnified
Persons may have against the Other Indemnitors and (iii) the Surviving
Corporation, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, irrevocably waives,
relinquishes and releases the Other Indemnitors from any and all claims
against the Other Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any
other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. The Surviving Corporation
further agrees that no advancement or payment by the Other Indemnitors on
behalf of any Indemnified Person with respect to any claim for which such
Indemnified Person has sought indemnification from the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries shall affect the foregoing and the Other
Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the
extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of
such Indemnified Person against the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable. The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by each of the
Indemnified Persons and the Other Indemnitors and their respective heirs and
legal representatives.

5.11 _Employment and Employee Benefit Plans; 280G_.

(a) During the Transition Period, Purchaser shall provide to each individual
employed by any of the Acquired Companies immediately prior to the Closing
Date (a " _Company Covered Employee_ ") and who continues in Purchasers, the
Surviving Corporations or any of their respective Subsidiaries employment
following the Closing Date, compensation and employee benefits which are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those (other than equity-based
compensation) provided to the Company Covered Employees immediately prior to
the Closing Date by the Acquired Companies. The " _Transition Period_ " shall
be the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of (i)
the date that is the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) the
time when the Company Covered Employees become covered under the employee
benefit plans maintained by Purchaser on the same terms as provided to
Purchasers similarly situated employees.

 

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility and vesting (but not for benefit
accruals) under any benefit plan of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries in
which a Company Covered Employee participates after the Effective Time, such
employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Acquired
Companies. To the extent that any benefit plan of Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries in which a Company Covered Employee participates after the
Closing Date provides medical, dental or vision benefits (a " _Purchaser
Medical Plan_ "), Purchaser shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively at work requirements of such plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents except to the extent such
employee and his or her covered dependents were subject to such requirements
under a comparable Benefit Plan. In addition, with respect to the plan year
in which a Company Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in a
Purchaser Medical Plan, Purchaser shall cause any eligible expenses incurred
by such employee and his or her covered dependants under a comparable Benefit
Plan during such plan year to be taken into account under such Purchaser
Medical Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year.

 



48 (c) The Company and Purchaser shall provide each other with such
information as may be reasonably requested and take such action as may be
necessary or appropriate to effect the matters set forth in this _Section
5.11_.

(d) Nothing expressed or implied in this _Section 5.11_ shall (i) confer upon
any Company Covered Employee or any other current or former employee, officer,
director or consultant of any Acquired Company any rights or remedies
(including, without limitation, any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period) of any nature or kind whatsoever under or
by reason of the Agreement, or (ii) obligate Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to maintain any
particular employee benefit plan or limit the ability of Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate or
amend any such employee benefit plan to the extent permitted thereunder in
accordance with its terms. No Company Covered Employee (or other Person who is
not a signatory to this Agreement) shall have the right to enforce or compel
the enforcement of any provisions of this _Section 5.11_. The provisions of
this _Section 5.11_ shall not create in any current or former employee of the
Acquired Companies any rights, including without limitation rights as third-
party beneficiaries, to employment or continued employment with Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(e) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to submit, no less
than two (2) days prior to the Closing Date, to a stockholder vote (in
accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder) the right of any individual who is a "disqualified individual" (as
defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive payments and benefits that
could be deemed a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of
the Code) in connection with the Contemplated Transactions (such as payments
or benefits payable by reason of a termination of employment). The Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary waivers and
consents from such disqualified individuals. The Company shall provide a draft
of the materials it intends to use to conduct the stockholder vote described
in this _Section 5.11(e)_ to Purchaser no less than two (2) days prior to
distributing such materials to the Companys stockholders and any other
required Persons.

5.12  _Post-Closing Access Covenant_. From and after the Closing, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide the
Representative and its authorized representatives with reasonable access,
during normal business hours, to examine, review and copy (at
Representatives sole expense) the books and records of the Acquired
Companies, including financial and Tax information, correspondence and other
records, with respect to periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing
Date to the extent relevant to a claim for indemnification under _Article 8_
against the Indemnitor Stockholders or required for the purpose of complying
with _Section 2.5_ hereof or the Stockholders obligations under the
applicable securities, Tax, or other Legal Requirements; _provided_ that the
Representative and/or such representatives enter into a customary
confidentiality agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation. Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit the
Surviving Corporation to, for a period of seven (7) years following the
Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and
records of the Acquired Companies for any period prior to the Closing Date
without first giving reasonable prior notice to the Representative

 



49  and offering to surrender to the Representative such books and records or
any portion thereof which Purchaser or the Company may intend to destroy,
alter or dispose of. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 5.12_ hereof, neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be required to provide or authorize the provision of requested material to the
extent the provision of such material (i) would violate the terms of any
agreement to which the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound (including confidentiality agreements) or any applicable Legal
Requirement (including potential violations of Antitrust Law), (ii)
would adversely affect the attorney-client privilege of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates, or (iii)
relates to the disclosure of personnel records of the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records,
medical histories or other information which, in the Companys good faith
opinion (after consultation with legal counsel), would be reasonable likely to
subject the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiary to liability pursuant to
applicable Legal Requirements.

5.13 _Confidentiality_. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement are incorporated by reference herein and shall be binding on
Purchaser and the Company, and shall survive the Closing indefinitely, but
after the Closing, Purchaser shall be permitted to disclose information
relating to the Surviving Corporation as it exists on and after the Closing
Date in the ordinary course of business and as required by any applicable
Legal Requirement.

 

5.14 _No Solicitation_.

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the Closing or (ii) the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 9_ , none of the Acquired
Companies shall, and the Acquired Companies will not permit any of its
directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives to, directly or
indirectly:

(i) solicit, encourage or facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers from
any Person (other than Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof) relating to an
Acquisition Transaction;

 

(ii) participate in any substantive discussions or negotiations or enter into
any agreement with, or provide any information to, any Person (other than
Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof) regarding any of the Acquired Companies or
their business or in connection with any inquiry or proposal relating to any
Acquisition Transaction made by such Person; or 

(iii) accept or authorize or agree to accept any proposal or offer from any
Person (other than Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof) relating to an
Acquisition Transaction.

(b) _Pre-Existing Negotiations_. As of the date hereof, the Acquired
Companies and their respective representatives shall cease all preexisting
negotiations with all third parties (other than Purchaser or an Affiliate
thereof) related to an Acquisition Transaction and shall not recommence such
negotiations unless this Agreement is terminated.

5.15 _Financial Statements_. From the date hereof until the earlier of (i)
the Closing or (ii) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 9_
, the Company will deliver to

 



50  Purchaser, on such date as the same is delivered to the board of directors
of the Company or to any Stockholder or Affiliate of any Stockholder, (x)
audited consolidated balance sheets of CDSI II Holding Company, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and the related consolidated statements
of operations, cash flows and stockholders equity for the fiscal year then
ended together with the reports thereon of KPMG LLP (collectively, the "
_2010 Financial Statements_ "); and (y) true, complete and correct copies of
all regularly prepared unaudited monthly, quarterly and annual consolidated
financial statements of CDSI II Holding Company, Inc. and its Subsidiaries
prepared in the ordinary course of business; _provided_ in each case, that
such provision of materials does not violate clauses (i)-(vi) of _Section
5.9_ hereof to the extent applicable.

 

5.16 _Affidavit Concerning Certain Withholding Tax Obligations_. The Company
shall have delivered (i) a duly executed certificate, dated as of the Closing
Date, prepared in accordance with Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code certifying that the Company is not and has
not been within the past five (5) years a "United States real property
holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code and (ii)
proof reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that the Company has provided
notice of such statement to the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with
the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h)(2).

5.17 _Employment Contracts; Resignation and Release_.

(a) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company
shall enter, or cause each applicable Acquired Company to enter into a
separation and release agreement, customary in form and substance and to be
mutually agreed upon between the Company and Purchaser with respect to
the employees set forth on _Part 5.17(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b) The Company shall have delivered to Purchaser on or prior to the Closing
Date written resignations, effective as of the Effective Time, of those

to the Closing Date. Each such resignation shall be delivered by the Company
together with a written release, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_
(the " _D andO Release_"), which shall be contingent upon and effective as of
the Effective Time.

5.18 _Purchaser Non-Solicitation_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, except as set forth in _Part 5.18_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, Purchaser agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that for a period of two years following such date of
termination, none of Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall, either
individually or through their respective representatives, without the prior
written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly solicit for employment
or hire any director, manager, officer or other employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
restriction on solicitation shall not prohibit a general solicitation (such as
an advertisement) not specifically directed to employees of the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

 



51 5.19 _Company Non-Solicitation_. In the event that this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, the Company agrees, on behalf of
itself and its Subsidiaries, that for a period of two years following such
date, none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, either
individually or through their respective representatives, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, directly or indirectly solicit for employment or
hire any director, manager, officer or other employee of Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries who was introduced to the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions (collectively, the " _Purchaser
Restricted Persons_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
restriction on solicitation shall not prohibit (i) a general solicitation
(such as an advertisement) not specifically directed to employees of Purchaser
or its Subsidiaries or (ii) any other solicitation or hiring of any director,
manager, officer or other employee of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Purchaser Restricted Persons).

5.20 _Contacts_. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser, its Affiliates and their
respective representatives shall not contact or communicate with patients,
payors, lenders, landlords, medical directors or any non-management employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions except upon prior written approval of the Company, which approval
(with respect to medical directors, landlords and payors only) shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. To the extent Purchaser
and the Company have mutual payors, service providers, or suppliers, the
Parties recognize that Purchaser and its Affiliates and their respective
representatives will continue to have contact and communicate with such
payors, service providers (excluding medical directors) and suppliers in the
ordinary course of business; _provided_ that with respect to such payors, such
contact and communication shall not relate to the Contemplated Transactions.
In the event the Contemplated Transactions are discussed with any supplier or
service provider, Purchaser agrees to promptly inform the Company of such
discussions.

5.21 _Certain Post-Closing Obligations of the Surviving Corporation_. After
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, timely file with the appropriate Governmental Body all
notice letters, amendments to applications, Medicare and Medicaid filings and
other state filings permitted to be filed after the Closing, in order to
satisfy the ownership disclosure requirements or any other requirements of
Healthcare Laws in all material respects, including the filings set forth on
_Schedule C_. Copies of all such filings made shall be promptly provided to
the Representative.

 

5.22 _Purchase of Joint Venture Interests_.

 

(a) With respect to each of the Joint Ventures identified on _Part 3.2(d)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, from and after the date hereof, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions required under
the relevant Ownership Documents of each such Joint Venture to deliver to each
JV Buyout Person all notices and other information required to be given in
accordance with the applicable Ownership Documents in light of the
Contemplated Transactions.

(b) If, after the date hereof and at or prior to the earlier of the Closing
and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 9_ , a JV Buyout
Person elects to cause the Company to purchase such JV Buyout Persons
interests in the applicable Joint Venture

 



52  in accordance with, and subject to the conditions in, the applicable
Ownership Documents, the Company may, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, consummate such transactions in accordance with the applicable
Ownership Documents, provided that, unless prohibited by the applicable
Ownership Documents, the Company shall consult with Purchaser in connection
therewith, give Purchaser opportunity to review and comment on all material
documents related thereto and to participate in any negotiations with the
applicable JV Buyout Person.

 

(c) Provided that (a) the Company has complied in all material respects with
_Section 5.22(b)_, (b) the economic terms of such transaction are consistent
with the Ownership Documents (and if not, have been approved in writing by
Purchaser, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), and (c) all material agreements to be entered into by the
Company in connection with such JV Buyout are customary in form and substance
in all material respects (with respect to each such Joint Venture, the " _JV
Buyout Agreements_ "), then: 

(i) if any such JV Buyout is to be consummated at and contingent upon the
Closing of the Merger, then at the Closing Purchaser shall pay directly to
each such applicable JV Buyout Person (a " _Closing JV Buyout Person"_ ) (as
indicated in the Closing Payment Statement) on behalf of the Company, the cash
consideration due to each such Closing JV Buyout Person pursuant to the
applicable JV Buyout Agreement (such amount in the aggregate, the " _Closing
JV Buyout Amount_ ") and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Closing JV Buyout
Amount shall not be considered Closing Date Indebtedness nor a liability of
the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of Adjusted Net Working Capital;
and

(ii) if any such JV Buyout is consummated after December 31, 2010 but prior to
the Closing, then the consideration paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries to
each such JV Buyout Person prior to the Closing in respect of the applicable
JV Buyout shall be considered for all purposes hereunder, in the aggregate, as
the " _Pre-Closing JV Buyout Amount_ ", which amount, in accordance with the
terms of _Section 1.2(b)_, shall be incorporated into the Merger
Consideration; and

(iii) if any such JV Buyout is to be consummated post-Closing, then the
consideration to be paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries to each such JV
Buyout Person post-Closing (such amount in the aggregate, the " _Post-Closing
JV Buyout Amount_ ") shall not be considered for any purposes hereunder as

ARTICLE 7

 

TAX MATTERS

7.1 _[RESERVED]_

7.2 _Contests_.

 

(a) After the Closing, Purchaser shall promptly notify the Representative in
writing of the proposed assessment or the commencement of any Tax audit or
administrative or judicial proceeding (a " _Contest_ ") or of any demand or
claim on Purchaser, its Affiliates, or any Acquired Company which, if
determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could be
grounds for indemnification against the Stockholders under _Article 8_. Such
notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known to Purchaser,
its Affiliates, or any Acquired Company) describing the asserted
Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or
other document received from any Tax authority in respect of any such asserted
Tax liability. The failure of Purchaser to give the Representative prompt
notice of an asserted Tax liability as required by this _Section 7.2_ shall
not relieve the Stockholders of any obligation to indemnify for any loss
arising out of such asserted Tax liability, except if the Stockholders shall
have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(b) With respect to taxable periods that include but do not end on the date
of the Closing, Purchaser may elect to direct and control, through counsel of
its own choosing, any Contest involving any asserted Tax liability with
respect to which indemnity may be sought from the Stockholders pursuant to
_Article 8_. If Purchaser elects to direct a Contest, Purchaser shall within
ninety (90) calendar days of receipt of the notice of asserted Tax liability
notify the Representative of its intent to do so. In such case, the
Representative may participate at its own expense in the Contest and
Purchaser shall not settle or compromise any asserted liability without prior
written consent of the Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. If Purchaser elects not to direct the Contest, the Representative
may assume control of such Contest (at the Representatives own expense) as it
relates to Pre-Closing Taxes and Purchaser and the applicable Acquired
Companies shall

 



57  cooperate, at the Representatives expense, in each phase of such Contest.
However, in such case, the Representative may not settle or compromise any
asserted liability without prior written consent of Purchaser; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that consent to settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

(c) Purchaser and the Representative agree to cooperate, and Purchaser agrees
to cause the Acquired Companies to cooperate, in the defense against or
compromise of any claim in any Contest.

 

7.3 _Preparation of Tax Returns_. Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause
the Acquired Companies to prepare and file) all Tax Returns that relate to
the Acquired Companies due after the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall
be prepared on a basis consistent with those prepared for prior taxable
periods unless a different treatment of any item is required by applicable
Legal Requirement. Purchaser shall provide the Representative with a copy of
such completed Tax Return at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date
(including any extension thereof) for filing of such Tax Return, or such
shorter period as is practicable for Tax Returns due shortly after Closing,
and the Representative shall have the right to review and comment on such Tax
Return and statement prior to the filing of such Tax Return. Purchaser shall
agree to make such revisions to such Income Tax Returns as are reasonably
requested by the Representative, except to the extent that Purchaser believes
the proposed revisions are not more likely than not the correct treatment, in
which case Purchasers position shall prevail unless the Representative
provides a legal opinion reasonably acceptable to Purchaser of nationally
recognized counsel that Representatives position is more likely than not the
correct treatment.

 

7.4 _Tax Refunds_. Any refund of Taxes (i) that relates to a Tax period or a
portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date for which there could be
grounds for indemnification against the Stockholders under _Article 8_ ,
except to the extent reflected as an asset in Closing Adjusted Net Working
Capital or (ii) to the extent included as a liability in Closing Adjusted Net
Working Capital, shall be for the benefit of the Stockholders and shall be
paid over to the Representative on their behalf within ten (10) days after
receipt thereof by Purchaser or any Acquired Company, net of any reasonable
third party expenses incurred by Purchaser or any Acquired Company (including
any Tax reasonably expected to be imposed on the receipt or accrual of such
refund); _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 7.4_ shall not apply
with respect to any refund of federal income Taxes.

7.5 _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. The Representative and
Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as
either of them reasonably may request of the other (and Purchaser shall cause
the Acquired Companies to provide such cooperation and information) in filing
any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a
liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or
conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation
and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or
portions thereof, together with related work papers and documents relating to
rulings or other determinations by Tax authorities. The Representative and
Purchaser shall make themselves (and their respective employees) reasonably
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide explanations of any
documents or information provided under this _Section 7.5_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the Representative,
Stockholders and Purchaser shall retain

 



58  all Tax Returns, work papers and all material records or other documents in
its possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates) relating to Tax
matters of the Acquired Companies for any taxable period that includes the
Closing Date and for all prior taxable periods until the later of (a) the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such
Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions or (b)
six years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns.
After such time, before the Representative, Stockholders or Purchaser shall
dispose of any such documents in its possession (or in the possession of its
Affiliates), the other Party shall be given an opportunity, after ninety (90)
days prior written notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such
documents as such other Party may select (at such other Partys expense).
Any information obtained under this _Section 7.5_ shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other
proceeding.

 

7.6 _Amended Tax Returns_. Except as otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements, Purchaser or the Acquired Companies shall not (and shall not
cause or permit the any Acquired Company to) amend any Tax Return for the
taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date,
without the prior written consent of Seller which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

7.7 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Stockholders and Purchaser shall each be liable
for, and agree to pay one-half of, any and all Conveyance Taxes that may be
imposed upon, or payable or collectible or incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions. Purchaser and the Representative,
on behalf of the Stockholders, agree to cooperate in the execution and
delivery of all instruments and certificates necessary to enable Purchaser to
comply with any pre-Closing filing requirements.

7.8 _Deductions Relating to Certain Options_. The Parties intend that stock
options otherwise subject to cash out on the Closing Date shall be cashed out
three (3) days after the Closing and all related compensation-paid deductions
shall be reported as a post-closing item on Purchasers consolidated income
tax return.

7.9 _Section 338 Election_. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree
that any Tax incurred directly or indirectly in connection with any Section
338 election (or any similar election under state or local Tax law) made in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be solely
the responsibility of Purchaser and will not be subject to indemnity under
_Article 8_.

 

7.10 _Transaction Tax Benefits_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, (a) prior to the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall make all income Tax payments, including all estimated income Tax
payments, that would be made in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice or would be required by Legal Requirement, and (b) all
such income Tax payments (including estimated income Tax payments) shall be
made without taking into account any Transaction Tax Benefits, in each case
calculated without regard to any election under _Section 7.9_.

  



59 ARTICLE 8

INDEMNIFICATION

8.1 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the Parties contained
in _Article 3_ and _Article 4_ hereof shall survive the Closing; _provided_ ,
that, subject to the last sentence of this _Section 8.1_, such
representations and warranties shall terminate on the date that is the one-
year anniversary of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.2(a)_ (Authority),
_Section 3.3_ (Capitalization),  _Section 3.10_ (Taxes), _Section 3.11_
(Employee Benefits), _Section 3.13_ (Payment Programs), _Section 3.22_
(Brokers) (all of the foregoing, collectively, the " _Fundamental
Representations_ "),  _Section 4.2_ (Power and Authority; Authorization;
Valid and Binding), and _Section 4.5_ (Brokers) shall survive the Closing for
the applicable statute of limitations. All covenants and agreements contained
herein which by their terms contemplate actions or impose obligations
following the Closing shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms and shall terminate on the date that is
the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date. All covenants and agreements
contained herein which by their terms contemplate full performance at or prior
to Closing shall terminate upon Closing, except _Section 5.24_ (Other
Agreements) which shall survive the Closing for the applicable statute of
limitations. The period of time a representation or warranty or covenant or
agreement survives the Closing pursuant to this _Section 8.1_ shall be the "
_Survival Period_ " with respect to such representation or warranty or
covenant or agreement. In the event notice of any claim for indemnification
under this _Article 8_ shall have been given within the applicable Survival
Period and such claim has not been finally resolved by the expiration of such
Survival Period, the representations or warranties or covenants or agreements
that are the subject of such claim shall survive, but only to the extent of
and in the amount of and for the sole purpose of the claim as made prior
to the expiration of the Survival Period, until such claim is finally
resolved.

8.2 _Indemnification_. Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set
forth in this _Article 8_ , from and after the Closing Date:

(a) The Indemnitor Stockholders, severally, and not jointly, in accordance
with their respective Percentage Interests, shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Purchaser, Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
and officers, directors, members, partners, managers, representatives,
attorneys, assigns and employees (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against, and shall reimburse Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for, any costs or expenses (including reasonable documented out-of-
pocket attorneys fees and expenses (but excluding any allocated costs of
internal counsel)), judgments, fines, claims, settlements (whether monetary,
equitable, declaratory and/or injunctive), damages, liabilities and
assessments (collectively, " _Losses_ ") that are imposed on or incurred by
any of Purchaser Indemnified Parties which arise out of or result from (i)
any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in _Article
3_ hereof (without giving effect to any qualification or limitation as to
"material," "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect", provided
that, in no event shall (A) "Material Contract" be read to mean "Contract" or
(B) any such "material", "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect",
be read out of the first sentence of _Section 3.16_ or _Section 3.17(a)_),
(ii) the failure of the Representative to perform any covenant or agreement of
the Representative required to be performed after 

 



60  the Closing set forth in this Agreement, (iii) any Losses arising from any
inaccuracy in the Estimated Merger Consideration Payment Schedule or any Post-
Closing Payment Schedule or from the allocation (and payment in accordance
therewith) of the Merger Consideration among the Converted Equity Securities
and the Contingent Payees in respect of the Contingent Payment Contracts, (iv)
any of the matters set forth on _Part 8.2(a)(iv)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, (v) any of the matters set forth on _Part 8.2(a)(v)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, or (vi) any Dissenting Shares.

 

(b) Purchaser and Merger Sub shall, jointly and severally, defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the Indemnitor Stockholders and each of their respective
Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, members, partners
(general and/or limited), equity holders, managers, representatives,
attorneys, assigns and employees (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against, and shall reimburse the Company Indemnified
Parties for, any Losses that are imposed on or incurred by any of the Company
Indemnified Parties which arise out of or result from (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Purchaser or Merger Sub in _Article 4_
hereof (without giving effect to any qualification or limitation as to
"material," "materiality" or "Purchaser Material Adverse Effect") or (ii) the
failure of Purchaser or Merger Sub to perform any covenant or agreement of
Purchaser or Merger Sub required to be performed after the Closing set forth
in this Agreement.

 

8.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. The following procedures shall govern claims
for indemnification under this _Article 8_ (other than Contests, which shall
be governed by _Section 7.2_):

(a) In order for a party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this _Article 8_ in respect of a claim made
against the Indemnified Party by any Person who is not a party to this
Agreement (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must notify the
indemnifying party hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of the
Third-Party Claim promptly following receipt by such Indemnified Party of
notice of the Third-Party Claim (which notice shall describe the applicable
breach or inaccuracy in reasonable detail, including all material details then
known to such Indemnified Party, copies of all material written evidence
thereof reasonably available to such Indemnified Party and the amount of such
of Losses that have been or may be sustained (or such Indemnified Partys good
faith estimate of the amount of such Losses if the amount is not yet
determined) by the applicable Indemnified Party in connection therewith);
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying
Party, promptly following the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third-Party Claim, other than those notices and
documents separately addressed to the Indemnifying Party.

(b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and
if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party; provided,

 



61  however, that if the defendants in any such Third-Party Claim include both
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall have reasonably concluded that there exists any actual conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such
action on behalf of such Indemnified Party and such Indemnified Party shall
have the right to retain, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, one separate
law firm reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to defend such
action on behalf of such Indemnified Party. Subject to the immediately
preceding proviso, should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, in each case at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the
Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. The Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party (which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party) for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed such defense (but excluding any allocated
costs of internal counsel).

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without
the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree
to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third-Party Claim relating
solely to monetary damages and that (i) by its terms obligates the
Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third-Party Claim and (ii) releases the Indemnified Party in connection
with such Third-Party Claim. Without duplication of any amounts reimbursed to
the Representative from the Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 10.1(e)_ and
up to a cap of $1,500,000, all costs, fees and expenses incurred by the
Indemnifying Party (including the Representative acting on behalf of the
Stockholders as Indemnifying Parties) in defending any claims or otherwise
satisfying its obligations under this _Section 8.3_ shall be deemed Losses
for purposes of the Cap and the Aggregate Cap and shall be reimbursed to such
party as incurred out of the Escrow Account.

(d) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under this _Article 8_ that does not involve a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party promptly following the Indemnified Party becoming aware of
the same (which notice shall describe the applicable breach or inaccuracy,
including all material details then known to such Indemnified Party, copies of
all material written evidence thereof reasonably available to
such Indemnified Party, and the amount of such Losses that have been or may
be sustained (or such Indemnified Partys good faith estimate of the amount of
such Losses if the amount is not yet determined) by the applicable Indemnified
Party in connection therewith); _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give
such notification shall not affect the indemnification

 



62  provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have
been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 

8.4 _Indemnification Limitations_.

(a) Other than pursuant to _Section 8.4(i)_, in no event shall the Indemnitor
Stockholders be liable for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_
or  _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_, unless and until the aggregate of all Losses with
respect thereto that are imposed on or incurred by Purchaser Indemnified
Parties thereunder exceeds Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) (the "
_Deductible_ "), in which case Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to indemnification by the Indemnitor Stockholders in full for all Losses in
excess of the Deductible; _provided_ , that no claim for indemnification
by Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ or _Section
8.2(a)(ii)_ shall be asserted for any individual item or a series of related
items where the Losses with respect to such item or series of related
items (in the aggregate) are less than One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($150,000) (the " _Basket_ ") (and if the Losses relating to such item or
series of related items, do not exceed the Basket, then such Losses shall not
be counted toward satisfaction of the Deductible). Further, the Indemnitor
Stockholders shall not be required to make payments for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_, _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_ and/or _Section
8.2(a)(iv) _in an aggregate amount in excess of Twenty-Five Million Dollars
($25,000,000) (the " _Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the prior sentence, the Cap
shall not apply to any Losses incurred by Purchaser Indemnified Parties which
arise out of or result from the breach of any Fundamental Representation or
for any Losses arising out of or relating to _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_, _Section
8.2(a)(v)_ or _Section 8.2(a)(vi)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the aggregate amount payable to Purchaser Indemnified Parties
for all Losses which arise out of or result from _Section 8.2(a)_ exceed
Three Hundred Ten Million Dollars ($310,000,000) (the " _Aggregate Cap_ "). 

(b) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary, on and after the Closing,
the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Losses
hereunder will be to make a claim in accordance with the terms of this
_Article 8_ and, at such time that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties Losses
indemnified hereunder pursuant to  _Section 8.2(a)_ equal the Cap, the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties will have no further right to indemnification
under this _Article 8,_ except for any Losses incurred by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties arising out of or resulting from any breach of any
Fundamental Representation or for any Losses arising out of or resulting from
_Section 8.2(a)(iii)_, _Section 8.2(a)(v)_ or _Section 8.2(a)(vi)_ all of
which shall be subject to the Aggregate Cap,  _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit any Partys remedies for
fraud. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all amounts
payable to Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Article 8_ shall
be satisfied solely from the funds then in the Escrow Account until the funds
in the Escrow Account have been exhausted, and thereafter, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties will have no further right to indemnification under this
_Article 8_ except for Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
arising out of or resulting from any breach of any Fundamental Representation
or for any Losses arising out of resulting from  _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_,
_Section 8.2(a)(v)_, or _Section 8.2(a)(vi)_, all of which shall be subject
to, in the aggregate, the Aggregate Cap. Notwithstanding anything else herein,
the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that, once

 



63  the funds in the Escrow Account have been exhausted, any liability of the
Indemnitor Stockholders hereunder surviving shall be several (in accordance
with their respective Percentage Interests) and not joint. If the Closing
occurs, the Indemnitor Stockholders will have no indemnification liability
under this _Article 8_ unless during the applicable Survival Period, Purchaser
notifies the Indemnitor Stockholders pursuant to the notice provisions set
forth in _Section 10.2_ of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim
in reasonable detail to the extent then known by Purchaser.

 

(c) If the Closing occurs, Purchaser or Merger Sub will have no
indemnification liability under this _Article 8_ with respect to (i) any
representation or warranty of Purchaser or Merger Sub, or (ii) any covenant or
obligation to be performed and complied with by Purchaser or Merger Sub after
the Closing Date, unless on or before the expiration of the applicable
Survival Period, the Company Indemnified Parties notify Purchaser pursuant to
the provisions set forth in _Section 10.2_ of a claim specifying the factual
basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by
the Company Indemnified Parties. All payments required from Purchaser or
Merger Sub for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ shall be subject
to the Basket, Deductible and Cap; _provided_ , _however_ that the Cap shall
not apply to any Losses incurred by the Company Indemnified Parties which
arise out of or result from a breach by Purchaser or Merger Sub of _Section
4.2_ (Power and Authority; Authorization; Valid and Binding), or _Section
4.5_ (Brokers); _provided_ _further_ , that the Basket, Deductible and Cap
shall not apply to any Losses arising out or relating to the failure of the
Company to timely pay the Delayed COC Payments; _provided_ _further_ , 
_however_ , that in no event shall the aggregate amount payable to the Company
Indemnified Parties for all Losses pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ exceed the
Aggregate Cap.

 

(d) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party, the amount of the
indemnified Losses shall not be duplicative of any other Loss for which an
indemnification claim has been made, and shall be computed net of (i) payments
recovered by the Indemnified Party under any insurance policy with respect to
such Losses, (ii) any prior or subsequent recovery by the Indemnified Party
from any Person (other than an Indemnifying Party) with respect to such
Losses, (iii) any reduction actually realized in the Indemnified Partys (or
any Affiliates) income tax liability for the taxable year in which the Loss
was paid or incurred or in the two subsequent taxable years as a result of
paying or incurring such Loss, calculated on a with or without basis, and (iv)
all reserves related to the specific matter subject to indemnification on the
Final Closing Statement or reflected in Adjusted Net Working Capital as of the
Closing. For the purposes of this _Article 8_ , notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Company, the Indemnitor
Stockholders, Purchaser or Merger Sub be liable for any consequential
damages, special damages, punitive damages, lost profits, damages calculated
as a multiple of earnings or revenue, diminution in value or loss of business
reputation or opportunity.

 

(e) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be obligated to
use its reasonable best efforts to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware
of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses
that are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith.

 



64 (f) Following the Closing, Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to claim and recover any Losses
suffered by a Purchaser Indemnified Party under any insurance policies
maintained by or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
otherwise covering the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or from
other third parties. In the event that an insurance recovery or recovery under
an indemnification or other agreement is made by Purchaser, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to any
Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund
equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders).

 

(g) Upon payment of any claim pursuant to this _Article 8_ , the Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to the rights of the
Indemnified Party against any Person with respect to the subject matter of
such claim. The Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party, at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to
pursue any claims against or otherwise recover amounts from, any Person liable
or responsible for any Losses for which indemnification has been received
pursuant to this _Article 8_.

 

(h) Any amounts payable by the Indemnitor Stockholders pursuant to this
_Article 8_ in respect of Losses incurred at any Joint Venture or other
Subsidiary that is not directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Company
shall be limited to an amount equal to (x) the amount of such Loss multiplied
by (y) the Companys direct or indirect ownership interest in such Joint
Venture or other Subsidiary (expressed as a percentage); _provided_ ,
_however_ , the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any Losses arising out
of or relating to the Fundamental Representations (other than  _Sections
3.10_ , _3.11_ and _3.13_ ) or _Section 5.24_. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this _Section 8.4(h)_, the foregoing limitations shall not apply
to any Losses that are actually paid by Purchaser or its wholly owned
Subsidiaries without reimbursement by the applicable non-wholly owned Joint
Venture.

(i) The limitations set forth in this _Section 8.4_ shall not apply with
respect to fraud in connection with this Agreement or any of the Contemplated
Transactions.

 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
no Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any Losses in respect of any
liability or Loss which is contingent unless and until such contingent
liability or Loss becomes an actual liability or Loss and is due and payable;
and (ii) no Indemnifying Party shall be liable to pay any amount in discharge
of a claim under this _Article 8_ unless and until the liability or Loss in
respect of which the claim is made has become due and payable.

 

(k) Neither a Purchaser Indemnified Party, nor the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties as a group or class, shall be entitled to recover from the Indemnitor
Stockholders, collectively, pursuant to this _Article 8_ more than once in
respect of the same Losses suffered. Neither a Company Indemnified Party, nor
the Company Indemnified Parties as a group or class, shall be entitled to
recover from Purchaser pursuant to this _Article 8_ more than once in respect
of the same Losses suffered.

 



65 (l) None of the Indemnitor Stockholders shall be liable for any Losses
in respect of any claim pursuant to this _Article 8_ to the extent that the
facts, matters or circumstances giving rise to such claim were Known to the
Purchaser prior to the Closing, _provided_ , _however_ , the terms of this 
_Section 8.4(l)_ shall not apply to any facts, matters or circumstances Known
to the Purchaser with respect to (i) any of the matters set forth on _Part
8.2(a)(iv) and(v)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (ii) any Losses
arising out of, or relating to, matters contemplated by _Section 3.12_ or
_Section 3.13_.

(m) No Stockholder shall be liable under this _Article 8_ for any Losses in
respect of any claim or any matter, act, omission or circumstance (or any
combination thereof), including the aggravation of a matter or circumstance,
to the extent (but only to the extent) that such Losses would not have
occurred but for any action taken or omitted as expressly required to be taken
or omitted by this Agreement or otherwise at the written request of or with
the written approval of Purchaser.

8.5 _Release of Escrow_. Any Loss that has been incurred and established as
set forth herein by a Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be paid from the
Escrow before any Purchaser Indemnified Party may, subject to the limitations
otherwise set forth in _Section 8.4(b)_, seek payment for such Loss directly
from any Indemnifying Party on a several basis in accordance with his, her or
its Percentage Interest. The Escrow Agreement shall provide that (a) at the
six (6)-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall release
to the Representative and/or the Stockholders (as designated in writing by
the Representative) the Releasable Escrow Amount, if any, and (b) at the date
that is the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Escrow
Termination Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall release to the Representative
and/or the Stockholders (as designated in writing by the Representative) the
balance of the funds remaining in the Escrow Account, less any amounts paid or
payable to reimburse the expenses of, and/or to indemnify, the Representative
pursuant to _Section 10.1_ and less an amount equal to 100% of any then
pending bona fide claims for indemnification by any Purchaser Indemnified
Party, which amounts shall be retained until the relevant claim is resolved
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Any amounts released to the
Representative or its designee (on behalf of the Stockholders) shall be
distributed among the Stockholders in accordance with _Section 2.6_ hereto. 

8.6 _Additional Tax Consideration_. Any amount that is paid pursuant to this
_Article 8_ shall be treated by all parties for Tax purposes as an adjustment
of the Merger Consideration.

ARTICLE 9

 

TERMINATION

9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the
Effective Time as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of each of Purchaser and the Company;

 

(b) by either Purchaser or the Company, if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before August 4, 2011 (such date, as may be extended pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(b)_, the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
if all of the conditions precedent to

 



66  Closing set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_ other than the condition set
forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ (and other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing or on the Closing Date) are or were
capable of being satisfied as of such date, then Purchaser (if it is not then
in material breach of this Agreement) may unilaterally extend the date for
termination under this  _Section 9.1(b)_ for one (1) additional month by
delivering written notice to the Company on or prior to August 4, 2011 _;_
_provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
9.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Termination Date.

 

(c) by either Purchaser or the Company, if a Governmental Body shall have
issued an Order having the effect of making the Merger illegal or permanently
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, and such Order shall have become
final and nonappealable (but only if such Party shall have used its reasonable
best efforts to cause such Order to be lifted or vacated (unless such Order
relates to Antitrust Law which is subject to a lower standard of efforts) and
shall have otherwise complied with its obligations under this Agreement);

 

(d) by either the Company or Purchaser, if (x) there shall have been a
material breach by the other of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach would result
in the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in _Section
6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_ (in the case of a breach by the Company) or
_Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ (in the case of a breach by Purchaser
or Merger Sub), and such breach shall be incapable of being cured or, if
capable of being cured, shall not have been cured prior to the earlier to
occur of (x) thirty (30) calendar days after written notice thereof shall have
been received by the Party alleged to be in breach and (y) the Termination
Date;

 

(e) by Purchaser, if the Principal Stockholder Consents shall not have been
delivered to Purchaser within a reasonable time frame after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, and in any event prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern
Standard Time on the date hereof, _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
termination right pursuant to this  _Section 9.1(e)_ is available only until
such time as Purchaser receives the Principal Stockholder Consents
constituting the Required Company Stockholder Vote;

 

(f) by Purchaser, if Purchaser delivers the Purchaser HSR Certificate to the
Company (it being understood and agreed that Purchaser must exercise this
termination right within three (3) Business Days of Purchasers receipt of
terms or conditions it determines to be commercially unreasonable); or

 

(g) by the Company, if the Purchaser shall have entered into an agreement with
any Governmental Body not to consummate the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions.

9.2 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 



67 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this  _Article
9_ , this Agreement (other than as set forth in _Section 5.7_, _Section
5.13_, _Section 5.18_, _Section 5.19,_ this _Section 9.2_, _Section 10.7_
and _Section 10.8_ but solely in respect of the Parties obligations under
_Section 5.7_, _Section 5.13_, _Section 5.18_ and _Section 5.19_) shall
become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any Party
(or of any of its representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , no such
termination or any other provision hereunder shall relieve any Party from any
liability for damages resulting from any fraud or (except with respect to
Purchasers obligations to pursue or obtain any Antitrust Approval, other
than the obligations under _Section 5.7_) any breach of this Agreement prior
to such termination.

 

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by Purchaser or the Company
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ and at the time of such termination, (i) the
condition set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ has not been satisfied and (ii) the
Company shall (A) have satisfied the condition contemplated by _Section
6.2(b)(i)_ to the extent set forth on _Schedule B-2_ , (B) be in a position
to satisfy the condition contemplated by _Section 6.2(f)_ if, in lieu of such
termination, the Closing were consummated, and (C) not otherwise be in
Material Breach, Purchaser shall pay the Company, (x) concurrently with a
termination by Purchaser or (y) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in
any event, within three (3) Business Days) following a termination by the
Company, Twenty-Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($27,500,000)
(the " _Break-Up Fee_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by the Company.

 

(c) In the event of termination of this Agreement by Purchaser pursuant to
_Section 9.1(f)_, Purchaser shall pay the Company concurrently with such
termination, the Break-Up Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by the Company.

(d) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Purchaser or the
Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ if such Order is related to Antitrust
Law, Purchaser shall pay the Company, (x) concurrently with a termination by
Purchaser or (y) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event,
within three (3) Business Days) following a termination by the Company, the
Break-Up Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Company.

(e) In the event of a termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant
to _Section 9.1(g)_, Purchaser shall pay to the Company, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within three (3) Business Days)
following such termination, the Break-Up Fee by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to an account designated by Company.

(f) Any Break-Up Fee payable by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_,
_Section 9.2(c)_, _Section 9.2(d)_, or _Section 9.2(e)_, as applicable,
shall be paid as liquidated damages (and not as a penalty), it being agreed
among the Parties that the actual damages to the Company in such event are
impractical to ascertain and the amount of the Break-Up Fee is a reasonable
estimate thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, if paid, the Break-Up Fee shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy available pursuant to this Agreement in
connection with Purchasers and Merger Subs obligations to obtain Antitrust
Approval; _provided_ that,

 



68  notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of the
provisions herein with respect to the Break-up Fee, including the payment of
the Break-Up Fee, shall affect or otherwise limit the Parties costs and
expenses reimbursement obligations set forth in _Section 5.7_ and _Section
10.13_.

9.3 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended at any time before the
Closing Date but only pursuant to a written agreement executed and delivered
by Purchaser, the Representative and the Company. At any time prior to the
Closing Date, either the Company, on the one hand, or Purchaser and Merger
Sub, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for or waive compliance with
the performance of any obligation or other act of any other Party, (b) waive
any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by any other
Party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in a writing signed by the
Party or Parties to be bound thereby, it being understood that no waiver shall
be deemed to waive any other circumstances or any other agreement or
condition not expressly named in such written waiver. No failure by any Party
to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power, or remedy under
this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other
right hereunder.

ARTICLE 10

Stockholder.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Representative shall

discretion, shall have consented) and to agree to such amendments or
modifications thereto as the Representative, in his, her or its sole
discretion, may deem necessary or desirable; (b) to give and receive notices,
communications and consents under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and/or

paying agent agreement; (j) to agree to any offsets or other additions or
subtractions of amounts to be paid under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and/or the paying agent agreement; (k) to cause the Escrow Amount to be
invested in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement,
it being understood and agreed that in no event shall the Representative be
deemed to be providing investment advice with respect to the investment of any
such funds, nor shall it have any liability for any loss incurred in
connection with the investment of the Escrow Amount; (l) to cause the Payment
Fund to be invested in accordance with the terms and conditions of the paying
agent agreement, it being understood and agreed that in no event shall the
Representative be deemed to be providing investment advice with respect to the
investment of any such funds, nor shall it have any liability for any loss
incurred in connection with the investment of the Payment Fund; (m) to
finalize any post-Closing adjustment of the Merger Consideration; and (n) to
make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements, guarantees,
orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all actions that the Representative, in
his, her or its sole discretion, may consider necessary or proper or
convenient in connection with or to consummate the Merger and carry out the
activities described in this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions. The
Representative shall not be responsible for any Loss suffered by, or liability
of any kind to, such Stockholders arising out of any act done or omitted by
the Representative in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Representatives duties hereunder, unless such act or omission involves gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

(c) The appointment of the Representative by the Stockholders is coupled with
an interest and may not be revoked in whole or in part (including, without
limitation, upon the death

 



70  or incapacity of any such Stockholder). Such appointment is binding upon the
heirs, executors, administrators, estates, personal representatives,
successors and assigns of each such Stockholder. All decisions of the
Representative are final and binding on all of the Stockholders, and shall be
deemed authorized, approved, ratified and confirmed by the Stockholders,
having the same force and effect as if performed by, or pursuant to
the direct authorization of, the Stockholders, and no Stockholder shall have
any right to challenge or otherwise question any such action, decision or
instruction. Each Stockholder hereby waives any and all defenses which may be
available to contest, negate or disaffirm any action of the Representative
taken in connection with the authority granted by this Agreement.

(d) The Representative hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser and Merger
Sub that the appointment of the Representative by the Stockholders and the
authority to act on the Stockholders behalf pursuant to this _Section 10.1_
has been duly and validly authorized by all requisite action. Purchaser shall
be entitled to rely upon, without independent investigation, any act, notice,
instruction or communication from the Representative and any document executed
by the Representative on behalf of the Stockholders and shall be fully
protected in connection with any action or inaction taken or omitted to be
taken in reliance thereon absent gross negligence or willful misconduct.

 

(e) The Representative shall receive no compensation for service as such, but
shall receive reimbursement from, and be indemnified by, the Stockholders,
for any and all expenses, charges and liabilities, including, but not limited
to, reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Representative in the
performance or discharge of its duties pursuant to this  _Section 10.1_ as
follows: (i) without duplication of amounts reimbursed to the Indemnifying
Party (including the Representative acting on behalf of the Stockholders as
Indemnifying Parties) pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_, from the Escrow Account
as and when such expenses or losses are incurred by the Representative, up to
an aggregate of $1,500,000, (ii) thereafter, from the Escrow Account as, when
and to the extent amounts from the Escrow Account are released to the
Stockholders in accordance with _Section 8.5_, and (iii) to the extent
reimbursements from the Escrow Account contemplated by clauses (i) and (ii)
are insufficient, from the Stockholders severally (and not jointly)
in accordance with their Percentage Interest; _provided_ _however_ , such
indemnification from the Stockholders shall not apply to the extent such
Losses are finally judicially determined to have been caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Representative; _provided_ _further_
, in no event shall the aggregate amount payable to the Representative for all
Losses pursuant to this indemnification, when aggregated with any Losses
payable by the Indemnitor Stockholders pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_, exceed
the Aggregate Cap.

(f) The provisions of this  _Section 10.01_ shall be subject to the terms of
the Existing Stockholders Agreement.

10.2  _Notices_. All notices and other communications given or made pursuant
hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made
