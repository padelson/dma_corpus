(K) willfully and intentionally take or omit to take any action that is
designed or reasonably likely to result in any of its representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement or any certificate delivered in
connection with the Closing being or becoming untrue in any material respect
at any time at or prior to the Closing;

(L) enter into any Affiliate Transaction; or

(M) authorize, agree, commit or enter into any Contract to take any of the
actions described in clauses (A) through (L) of this Section 5(c)(ii).

(d) Full Access. Seller will permit, and Seller will cause each Acquired
Company to permit, representatives of Buyer (including legal counsel and
accountants) to have full access at all reasonable times, and in a manner so
as not to interfere with the normal business operations of any Acquired
Company, to all premises, properties, personnel, books, records (including Tax
records), Contracts, and other documents of or pertaining to any Acquired
Company, including such documents as Buyer may reasonably request prior to
Closing supporting the Minimum Financial Condition Calculation; provided,
however, Buyer shall not have access to information that may not be provided
to Buyer under applicable Laws.

(e) Notice of Developments. Seller shall notify Buyer in writing of any
development, event, occurrence or circumstance first occurring after the date
hereof that would have been required to have been 

disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Letter if it had occurred prior to the date
hereof. Seller shall provide all such notices to Buyer promptly after first
becoming aware of such development, event, occurrence or circumstance. If any
such notice updates, amends or modifies the Seller Disclosure Letter in a
manner that, but for such update, amendment or modification, would cause (i)
any of the representations and warranties in Section 3(a)(v) (Holdings
Shares), Section 4(b) (Capitalization of Holdings), and Section 4(f)
(Subsidiaries) not to be true and correct or (ii) the representations and
warranties in Section 3(a) or Section 4 other than those set forth in clause
(i) not to be true and correct in all material respects, then in each case
Buyer may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8(a)(vi). Unless Buyer
has the right to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section 5(e) and
timely exercises such right pursuant to Section 8(a)(vi), such update,
amendment or modification shall not be deemed to result in a failure of the
condition set forth in Section 7(b)(i) to be satisfied. If the Closing shall
occur, then Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any right or claim pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, including pursuant to Section 10,
with respect to any and all matters disclosed at or prior to the Closing
pursuant to this Section 5(e).

(f) Exclusivity. None of Seller nor its Affiliates will (and Seller will not
cause or permit any Acquired Company or its Affiliates to), directly or
indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries
regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into discussions or negotiations
with, or provide any information to, any Person concerning a possible
Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements or other instruments
(whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition Proposal. Seller shall, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates and representatives to, immediately
discontinue any ongoing discussions or negotiations (other than any ongoing
discussions with Buyer) relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal.

(g) Confidentiality. The terms of the letter agreement dated July 5, 2016 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement") between Buyer and Southland National Holdings,
Inc. shall not be superseded by this Agreement and shall continue in full
force and effect until the Closing, at which time the confidentiality
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and the
confidentiality provisions of Section 6(d) shall apply instead. If, for any
reason, the Transaction is not consummated, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms.

(h) Affiliate Transactions and Intercompany Accounts. Prior to or at the
Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, (i) obtain
all required regulatory approvals to terminate all Affiliate Transactions and
settle all Intercompany Accounts, (ii) terminate all Affiliate Transactions
without any obligation of or liability to any of the Acquired Companies, on
terms reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and (iii) settle in full (without any
premium or penalty) the amount of all Intercompany Accounts (including the
$8,163,563 owed to the Acquired Companies by certain of their Affiliates as of
the date of the Most Recent Interim Financial Statements without the accrual
of additional interest) by payment in cash of all such amounts.

(i) Notice of Assignment and Assumption of Lease. Prior to Closing, Seller
shall use its best efforts to cause Tenant to execute and deliver to Landlord
a written notice of assignment of the Basking Ridge Lease to PLIC MI in
accordance with the terms of the Basking Ridge Lease. Seller hereby
acknowledges that Buyer intends to communicate with Landlord prior to Closing
with respect to certain terms of the Basking Ridge Lease and shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer in connection with
any such communications.

Section 6\. Post-Closing Covenants. From and after the Closing Date, each of
the Parties covenants and agrees as follows:

(a) General; Further Assurances. In case at any time after the Closing any
further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and
the intentions of the Parties, each Party will take such further action
(including the execution and delivery of such further instruments and
documents) as the other Party reasonably may request, all at the sole cost and
expense of the requesting Party (unless the requesting Party is entitled to
indemnification therefor under Section 10).

(b) Insurance. The Business and the operations and assets and liabilities in
respect thereof shall cease to be insured by Seller's or its Affiliates'
insurance policies, and neither Buyer nor its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) shall have any access, right, title or interest to or in
any such insurance policies (including to all claims and rights to make claims
and all rights to proceeds) to cover the Business or the operations or assets
or liabilities in respect thereof. Seller or its Affiliates may amend any
insurance policies in the manner it deems appropriate to give effect to this
Section 6(b). Buyer shall be responsible for securing all insurance it
considers appropriate for the Business and the operations and assets and
liabilities in respect thereof. At the Closing, Buyer 

agrees to take over and assume all the known and incurred but not reported
claims in respect of the Business and the operations and assets and
liabilities in respect thereof, which have been incurred as of the Closing,
and Buyer agrees to be responsible to pay such claims. Buyer further covenants
and agrees not to seek to assert or to exercise any rights or claims of, or in
respect of, the Business and the operations and assets and liabilities in
respect thereof, under or in respect of any past or current insurance policy
under which any of the foregoing is a named insured.

(c) Business Employees.

(i) At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall (or shall cause its applicable
Affiliates to) transfer the employment of each Business Employee who is not
employed by any Acquired Company to an Acquired Company. Any Business Employee
who is an employee of an Acquired Company as of the Closing shall be referred
to as a "Transferred Business Employee."

(ii) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date,
Buyer shall provide each Transferred Business Employee (A) the same wage rate
or base salary level in effect for such Transferred Business Employee
immediately prior to the Closing, (B) incentive compensation opportunities
(other than equity or equity-based compensation) for such Transferred Business
Employee that are no less favorable than those in effect immediately prior to
the Closing, and (C) employee benefits that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than those in effect for such Transferred Business Employee and
listed on Section 4(p)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Letter as of the date
hereof. As of and after the Closing, Buyer shall provide to each Transferred
Business Employee full credit for all purposes under any employee benefit
plan, policy or arrangement of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (except for
benefit accrual purpose under any defined benefit plans and equity and equity-
based compensation plans) for such Transferred Business Employee's service
prior to the Closing with Seller or any of its Affiliates, to the same extent
such service is recognized by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to
the Closing; provided that such service shall not be credited to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits.

(iii) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
Transferred Business Employee and his or her eligible dependents to be covered
on and after the Closing by a group health plan or plans maintained by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates, including an Acquired Company, that (A) do not limit
or exclude coverage on the basis of any preexisting condition of such
Transferred Business Employee or dependent (other than any limitation already
in effect under the applicable group health Employee Benefit Plan in which
such Transferred Business Employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing) or on the basis of any other exclusion or waiting period not in
effect under the applicable group health Employee Benefit Plan in which such
Transferred Business Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing,
and (B) provide each Transferred Business Employee full credit under Buyer's
or such Affiliate's group health plans for the year in which the Closing Date
occurs for any deductible or co-payment already incurred by the Transferred
Business Employee under the applicable group health Employee Benefit Plan in
which such Transferred Business Employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing and for any other out-of-pocket expenses that count against any
maximum out-of-pocket expense provision of the applicable group health
Employee Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Business Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing or Buyer's or such Affiliate's group health
plans.

(iv) With respect to each Transferred Business Employee whose employment is
terminated during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide such Transferred
Business Employee with severance benefits equal in value to the greater of (A)
those that such Transferred Business Employee would receive under the
applicable severance policy, program or arrangement of Buyer or its
Affiliates, and (B) those that such Transferred Business Employee would have
received under the applicable severance policy, program or arrangement of
Seller or its Affiliates as attached hereto as Section 6(c)(iv) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, in each case taking into account such Transferred Business
Employee's service with Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Closing and
with Buyer and its Affiliates on and after the Closing.

(v) Buyer shall recognize and assume all liabilities with respect to accrued
but unused vacation time for all Transferred Business Employees. Buyer shall
allow Transferred Business Employees to use the vacation, sick leave and
personal time recognized or established in accordance with the terms of
Seller's and its applicable Affiliates' programs in effect immediately prior
to the Closing Date (in addition to, and not in lieu of, any vacation accrued
under the applicable vacation plans or policies of Buyer or its Affiliates on
or following the Closing). 

(vi) Effective at the Closing, Buyer shall establish participation by the
Transferred Business Employees in Buyer's tax-qualified defined contribution
plan or plans with a cash or deferred feature (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan") for
the benefit of each Transferred Business Employee who, as of immediately prior
to the Closing, was eligible to participate in a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan maintained by Seller or its Affiliates (collectively, the
"Seller 401(k) Plans"). As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the
Seller 401(k) Plans shall, to the extent permitted by Section 401(k)(10) of
the Code, make distributions (including loans) available to Transferred
Business Employees, and the Buyer 401(k) Plan shall accept any such
distribution (including loans) as a rollover contribution if so directed by
the applicable Transferred Business Employee.

(vii) Without limiting the generality of Section 11(b), the provisions of this
Section 6(c) are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and
no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as
an amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan for any purpose.

(d) Covenant Not to Compete; Confidentiality.

(i) For a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date (the "Restricted
Period"), Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly:

(A) solicit or contact, or assist another Person in the solicitation of, any
Person who is an insured under any existing insurance policy issued by the
Acquired Companies for the purpose of replacing any such existing policy
provided by the Acquired Companies as of the date hereof;

(B) otherwise initiate or promote a program that would result in the
systematic replacement of the existing insurance policies issued by the
Acquired Companies or the systematic solicitation of the insureds under such
existing policies for the purpose of replacing the existing insurance policies
issued by the Acquired Companies as of the date hereof; or

(C) employ, or seek to employ, whether for itself, as applicable, or for any
other Person, any Transferred Business Employee or otherwise solicit,
encourage or entice any Transferred Business Employee to terminate or alter
his or her business relationship with any of the Acquired Companies or Buyer
or its Affiliates.

(ii) None of Seller or any of its Affiliates shall use or disclose any
confidential or proprietary information of or relating to any Acquired
Company, including without limitation customer information, either during the
term of this Agreement or at any time thereafter, except as required by Law or
by any Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and its
Affiliates shall be permitted to use or disclose any such information in
connection with its or their preparation of any financial statements or
reports or the filing or dissemination of such financial statements or reports
with or to the SEC, any insurance department, or any other Governmental
Authority.

(iii) From and after the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall cause their
respective representatives to maintain in confidence, and not use to the
detriment of Buyer or its Affiliates (including for the purposes of competing
with Buyer or its Affiliates), any written, oral or other information relating
to or obtained from Buyer or its Affiliates, except that the foregoing
requirements of this Section 6(d) shall not apply to the extent that (A) any
such information is or becomes generally available to the public other than as
a result of disclosure by Seller, its Affiliates or any of their respective
representatives in breach of this Section 6(d), (B) any such information is
required by applicable Law to be disclosed; provided, however, that Seller
shall provide Buyer written notice prior to such disclosure, or (C) any such
information was or becomes available to such Party on a non-confidential basis
and from a source (other than a Party or any Affiliate or representative of
such Party) that is not bound by a confidentiality agreement. Seller shall
instruct its Affiliates and representatives having access to such information
of such obligation of confidentiality and non-use.

(iv) Seller hereby agrees and acknowledges that money damages may not be an
adequate remedy for its breach of any covenant, obligation or other provision
set forth in this Section 6(d). Seller acknowledges that its violation of this
Section 6(d) may cause irreparable harm to the Acquired Companies. Seller
therefore agrees that each Acquired Company, including Buyer for itself or by
or on behalf of any Acquired Company, shall be entitled to seek injunctive
relief enjoining, prohibiting and restraining Seller and its Affiliates from 

the continuance of any such violation, in addition to any monetary damages
which might occur by reason of a violation of this Section 6(d) or any other
remedies at Law or in equity, including, without limitation, specific
performance.

(v) Seller acknowledges that this Section 6(d) is a material inducement to
Buyer entering into this Agreement, and that the acquisition of the Acquired
Companies as contemplated by this Agreement is of direct and material benefit
to Seller and is good and adequate consideration for the covenants given
herein.

(e) Name Change. Within thirty (30) days following the Closing, Buyer shall
(i) select a new name for Enstar Life that does not include "Enstar" or any
confusingly similar name and (ii) cause Enstar Life to take all such actions
(including amending its certificate of incorporation) as shall be necessary to
change its name to such new name. Buyer shall provide Seller with written
evidence of the name change contemplated by this Section 6(e) promptly after
such name change is effected in accordance with applicable Law.

(f) Officers and Directors.

(i) Seller shall deliver to Buyer the resignations of all members of the board
of directors of each Acquired Company from their positions as directors of
such Acquired Company immediately prior to the Closing, such resignations to
become effective upon the Closing.

(ii) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Acquired
Companies shall not, and Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies not to,
amend, repeal or modify any provision in their respective certificates of
incorporation or by-laws relating to the exculpation or indemnification for
any officers and directors (unless required by applicable Law), it being the
intent of the Parties that the officers and directors of the Acquired
Companies shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification to the full extent of the Law. Such officers and directors are
intended third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6(f) and may specifically
enforce its terms.

(g) Transition Services. Seller shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates
to, provide transition services to the Acquired Companies following the
Closing in accordance with the terms and conditions of a Transition Services
Agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Transition Services
Agreement").

(h) General Release. Seller and its Affiliates hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably acquit, remise, discharge and forever release, effective as of the
Closing, the Acquired Companies, and, to the extent acting in such capacity
for any Acquired Company, their respective equityholders, partners, managers,
trustees, employees, officers, directors, representatives and agents
(collectively, the "Releasees") from any and all liabilities and losses of
every kind whatsoever, whether accrued or fixed, absolute or contingent,
matured or unmatured, or determined or determinable, including those arising
under any Law, contract, agreement, arrangement, commitment or undertaking,
whether written or oral, to the extent arising prior to the Closing; provided
that liabilities acquitted, remised, discharged and released pursuant to this
Section 6(h) shall not include any rights of Seller under this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document.

(a) Termination of Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

Section 3(a) or Section 4 of this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct,
or Seller shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any
of its covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, and such
failure or breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7(b)(i) or Section 7(b)(ii) and has not been cured by the earlier of
(A) the date that is sixty (60) Business Days after the date that Seller has
notified Buyer of such failure or breach and (B) the Outside Date; provided

(v) by Seller, if any of Buyer's representations and warranties contained in
Section 3(b) of this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct or Buyer

(a) The Acquired Companies shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all material Tax Returns required to be filed by
each Acquired Company that are due on or before the Closing Date (taking into
account any extensions), and shall timely pay all Taxes that are due and
payable on or before the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions).
Any such material Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice (unless otherwise required by applicable Law). In order to
permit Buyer to review and comment on each such material Tax Return, Seller
shall deliver a copy of each such material Tax Return to Buyer (together with
schedules, statements and, to the extent requested by Buyer, supporting
documentation) no later than thirty (30) days (or, in the case of Tax Returns
filed more frequently than annually, ten (10) days) before the due date of
such Tax Return. If Buyer objects to any item on any such Tax Return, it
shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days (or, in the case of Tax Returns
filed more frequently than annually, five (5) days) after receipt of such Tax
Return from Seller, notify Seller in writing that it so objects, specifying
with particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal
basis for any such objection. Any such objection shall be handled by Buyer and
Seller in accordance with the provisions of Section 9(c) below.

(b) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns of each Acquired Company required to be filed by such
Acquired Company after the Closing Date for any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by applicable Law).
In order to permit Buyer to review and comment on each such Tax Return, Seller
shall deliver a copy of each such Tax Return to Buyer (together with
schedules, statements and, to the extent requested by Buyer, supporting
documentation) no later than thirty (30) days (or, in the case of Tax Returns
filed more frequently than annually, ten (10) days) before the due date of
such Tax Return. If Buyer objects to any item on any such Tax Return, it
shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days (or, in the case of Tax Returns
filed more frequently than annually, five (5) days) after receipt of such Tax
Return from Seller, notify Seller in writing that it so objects, specifying
with particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal
basis for any such objection. Any such objection shall be handled by Buyer and
Seller in accordance with the provisions of Section 9(c) below. Buyer shall
cause the Acquired Companies to timely pay all Taxes required to be paid with
respect to such Tax Returns and all expenses associated with the preparation
of such Tax Returns; provided however, that Seller shall promptly pay to the
Acquired Companies any actual Tax amounts to be paid for periods prior to
September 30, 2016 for which accrual has not been made on the Most Recent
Interim Financial Statements; provided further that the Acquired Companies
shall promptly pay to Seller any amounts for periods prior to September 30,
2016 for which the accruals on the Most Recent Interim Financial Statements
exceed the actual Tax amounts to be paid.

(c) If a notice of objection with respect to a Tax Return is duly delivered in
accordance with Section 9(a) or Section 9(b), Buyer and Seller shall negotiate
in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such items. If
Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement within ten (10) Business
Days after receipt of such notice by Seller, the disputed items shall be
resolved by an independent certified public accountant chosen by mutual
agreement of Buyer and Seller (the "Accountant") and any determination by the
Accountant shall be final. The Accountant shall resolve any disputed items
within ten (10) Business Days of having the item referred to it pursuant to
such procedures as it may require. If the Accountant is unable to resolve any
disputed items before the due date for such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall
be filed as prepared by Seller (taking into account any previously-resolved
items between Seller and Buyer), and then amended to reflect the Accountant's
resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the Accountant shall be borne and
paid 50% by the Seller and 50% by Buyer.

(d) Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates, including the Acquired Companies,
shall amend any Tax Return affecting a taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date, or take any other similar, affirmative
action that could increase the liability of Seller for Taxes in respect of
which an indemnity may be sought by the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to Section
10(a), without the prior written consent of Seller.

(e) All refunds, credits or other reductions of Taxes (including interest
received thereon) with respect to any taxable periods (or portions thereof)
ending on or before September 30, 2016 (and not for any tax period thereafter)
to the extent not reflected on the Most Recent Interim Financial Statements
shall be for the account of Seller, and Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall
pay or cause to be paid such amounts to Seller within five (5) Business Days
of the receipt or crediting thereof. Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates to, take all actions reasonably requested by
Seller to obtain any such Tax refunds, credits or other reductions as promptly
as possible. 

(f) Straddle Period. In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a
Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes that are treated as
attributable to the portion of a taxable period ending on September 30, 2016
for purposes of this Agreement shall be:

(i) in the case of Taxes (A) based upon, or related to, income, receipts,
profits, gains, supplies, wages, capital or net worth, (B) imposed in
connection with the sale, transfer or assignment of property, or (C) required
to be withheld, deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
taxable year ended on September 30, 2016; and

(ii) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
days in the period ending on September 30, 2016 and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire period.

(g) Waiver of Carrybacks. The Acquired Companies shall waive any carryback for
federal income tax purposes of net operating losses or credits that accrued in
the taxable year ended December 31, 2016.

(h) Seller, the Acquired Companies and Buyer shall provide each other with
such cooperation and information as any of them reasonably may request of the
others in filing any Tax Return pursuant to this Section 9 or in connection
with any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes of any Acquired
Company. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying
schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by tax authorities. Each of Seller, the Acquired Companies and
Buyer shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and
other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Acquired
Companies for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such
Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions except to
the extent notified by any of the other parties in writing of such extensions
for the respective Tax periods. Prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other
documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Acquired Companies
for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date, Seller, the Acquired
Companies or Buyer (as the case may be) shall provide the other parties with
reasonable written notice and offer the other parties the opportunity to take
custody of such materials.

Section 10\. Indemnification and Survival.

(a) Indemnification by Seller.

(i) To the extent set forth in this Section 10(a), from and after the Closing,
Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) and their respective officers, directors,
employees, stockholders, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnitees") against and in respect of all losses, damages, judgments,
settlements, fines, liabilities, costs and expenses (including (x) interest
and penalties, (y) reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses actually incurred
in connection therewith, and (z) incidental, consequential and special
damages, but only to the extent such damages are reasonably foreseeable, but
excluding any punitive damages (but including any punitive damages that are
paid to a third party in connection with a Third-Party Claim in accordance
with this Agreement)) (collectively, "Losses") that any Buyer Indemnitee
suffers or incurs as a result of, arising out of or based upon:

(A) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Seller set forth
in this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any certificate delivered
in connection with the Closing; or

(B) any breach or non-fulfillment of any of the covenants or agreements of
Seller set forth in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document;

(C) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of any Acquired Company for all Tax
periods or portions of Tax periods ending on or before September 30, 2016
(except to the extent that such Taxes have been accrued on the Most Recent
Interim Financial Statements);

(D) any penalties or interest owed on or with respect to any unpaid Taxes of
any Acquired Company for any period ending prior to the Closing Date (other
than penalties or 

interest resulting from a Buyer objection to a Tax Return prepared by Seller
pursuant to Section 9(a) or 9(b));

(E) any Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies at Closing or any Transaction
Expenses of the Acquired Companies not taken into account at the Closing
pursuant to Section 2(b); or

(F) any of the matters set forth on Section 4(o) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter for any Losses which are in the aggregate in excess of the amount of
the reserves and accruals set forth on Section 4(o) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter for such matters; provided, however, that if after final conclusion of
each of those matters, the aggregate amount of Losses is less than the amount
of such reserves and accruals, then Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies
to promptly pay Seller for the difference in such amount.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if all of the matters set
forth on Section 4(o) of the Seller Disclosure Letter are settled or otherwise
resolved prior to Closing, the Purchase Price shall be increased or decreased,
as applicable, to the extent that the aggregate amount of Losses is less than
or greater than the amount of the applicable reserves and accruals set forth
on Section 4(o) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, in which case neither Party
shall have any further obligations under Section 10(a)(i)(F).

(ii) Provisions Relating to Seller's Indemnity. Seller will not be liable for
any Loss described in Section 10(a)(i)(A) unless and until the aggregate of
all Losses for which Seller is liable is in excess of $1,200,000 (the
"Threshold Amount"), in which case Buyer may make claims for indemnification
for all Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount; provided that with respect
to any claim as to which Buyer may be entitled to indemnification under
Section 10(a)(i)(A), Seller shall not be liable for any individual or series
of related Losses which do not exceed $25,000 (which Losses shall not be
counted toward the Threshold Amount); provided, further, that (i) the
aggregate amount of all Losses for which Seller is liable pursuant to Section
10(a)(i)(A) shall in no event exceed $18,000,000 (the "Cap") other than for
its claims of Fraud (provided that as it relates to Losses arising out of any
and all claims with respect to Fundamental Representations and Warranties of
Seller or claims of Fraud, the Cap shall not apply and the aggregate liability
of Seller relating thereto, together with all other Losses, will not exceed
the Purchase Price), and (ii) absent claims of Fraud, Seller's aggregate
liability for indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a)(i)(B), (C), (D), (E)
and (F) will not, together with all other Losses, exceed the Purchase Price.

(iii) All amounts paid by Seller under this Section 10(a) will be treated for
Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law.

(iv) In determining the amount of any Losses under this Section 10(a), any
qualifications in the representations, warranties and covenants with respect
to a Business Material Adverse Effect, materiality or similar terms shall be
disregarded, and such qualifications will not have any effect with respect to
the calculation of the amount of any Losses attributable to a breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller set forth in this Agreement or in
exhibits, annexes or schedules hereto, or in any certificates or other
instruments delivered by or on behalf of Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) Indemnification by Buyer.

(i) To the extent set forth in this Section 10(b), from and after the Closing,
Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
and their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, successors
and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") against and in respect of
all Losses that any Seller Indemnitee suffers or incurs as a result of,
arising out of or based upon:

(A) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Buyer set forth
in this Agreement; or

(B) any breach or non-fulfillment of any of the covenants or agreements of
Buyer set forth in this Agreement.

(c) Provisions Relating to Buyer's Indemnity. Buyer will not be liable for any
Loss described in Section 10(b)(i)(A) unless and until the aggregate of all
Losses for which Buyer is liable is in excess of the Threshold Amount, in
which case Seller may make claims for indemnification for all Losses in excess
of the 

Threshold Amount; provided, that with respect to any claim as to which Seller
may be entitled to indemnification under Section 10(b)(i)(A), Buyer shall not
be liable for any individual or series of related Losses which do not exceed
$15,000 (which Losses shall not be counted toward the Threshold Amount);
provided, further, that (i) the aggregate amount of all Losses for which Buyer
is liable pursuant to Section 10(b)(i)(A) shall in no event exceed the Cap
other than for its claims of Fraud (provided, that as it relates to Losses
arising out of any and all claims with respect to Fundamental Representations
and Warranties of Buyer or claims of Fraud, the Cap shall not apply and the
aggregate liability of Buyer relating thereto, together with all other Losses,
will not exceed the Purchase Price), and (ii) absent a claim for Fraud,
Buyer's aggregate liability for indemnification pursuant to Section
10(a)(i)(B) will not, together with all other Losses, exceed the Purchase
Price.

(i) All amounts paid by Buyer under this Section 10(c) will be treated for Tax
purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law.

(ii) In determining the amount of any Losses under this Section 10(c), any
qualifications in the representations, warranties and covenants with respect
to a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, materiality or similar terms shall be
disregarded, and such qualifications will not have any effect with respect to
the calculation of the amount of any Losses attributable to a breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer set forth in this Agreement or in
exhibits, annexes or schedules hereto, or in any certificates or other
instruments delivered by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) Notice and Defense of Claims; Settlements.

(i) If a Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee seeks indemnification under
this Section 10, such Party (the "Indemnified Party") shall give prompt
written notice to other (the "Indemnifying Party") after receiving written
notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim
against it (if by a third party (a "Third-Party Claim")) or discovering the
liability or facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification, describing
in reasonable detail the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable)
and the basis thereof; provided, however, that failure of the Indemnified
Party to timely give the notice provided in this Section 10(d)(i) to the
Indemnifying Party shall not preclude the Indemnified Party from recovering
damages unless and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party can demonstrate
that it was actually prejudiced and damaged by such failure.

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to any such
claim, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to the Indemnified
Party, promptly but in no event greater than thirty (30) days after receipt of
written notice of the indemnification sought, of the dispute and describing
those portions and the amount (if known and quantifiable) of the claim in
dispute, and the basis of the dispute. Upon the Indemnified Party's receipt of
a timely notice of dispute, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall proceed to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved
through negotiations within fifteen (15) days of the Indemnified Party's
receipt of the dispute of the claim, such dispute shall be resolved in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(iii) Subject to Section 10(d)(i), if a Third-Party Claim is made which, if
adversely determined, may entitle the Indemnified Party to indemnity pursuant
to this Section 10, the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party of the same in writing, specifying in reasonable detail the
basis of such claim and the facts pertaining thereto and the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit,
proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to the Indemnified
Party's claim for indemnification at its expense, and at its option (subject
to the limitations set forth below) shall be entitled to appoint lead counsel
of such defense; provided, that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees and expenses of
counsel retained by the Indemnified Party, if the claim which the Indemnifying
Party seeks to assume control (A) seeks non-monetary relief, (B) involves
criminal or quasi-criminal allegations, (C) involves a claim to which the
Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse determination would be
detrimental or injurious to the Indemnified Party's reputation or future
business prospects, (D) involves a claim which, upon petition by the
Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party
failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend, (E) involves a
reasonable likelihood of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party, as communicated to the Indemnifying Party in
writing by counsel, or (F) includes as the named parties to such action
(including any impleaded parties) both the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel
that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified
Party which are not available to the Indemnifying Party. 

(iv) If the Indemnifying Party is permitted to assume and control the defense
and elects to do so, the Indemnified Party shall have the right at its expense
to employ counsel separate from counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party in
any such action and to participate in the defense thereof; provided that if
the Indemnifying Party has been advised by counsel that a reasonable
likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party, then the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by
the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.

(v) If the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any such claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before entering
into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim, if pursuant to
or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunction or other equitable
relief will be imposed against the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates, if
such settlement does not expressly unconditionally release the Indemnified
Party from all liabilities with respect to such claim and all other claims
arising out of the same or similar facts and circumstances, with prejudice and
the Indemnified Party pays all amounts in settlement thereof, or if such
settlement could adversely affect any Tax or other liability of the
Indemnified Party or any Affiliate of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified
Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before entering into any
settlement of a claim.

(e) Survival. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Parties contained herein and made pursuant to this Agreement, and the rights
of the Parties to seek indemnification with respect thereto, shall survive the
Closing; provided, however, that, except in respect of any claims for
indemnification as to which written notice shall have been duly given pursuant
to Section 10(d) prior to the expiration date set forth below, (i) such
representations and warranties, and the rights of the Parties to seek
indemnification with respect thereto, shall expire on that date that is
eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date and (ii) such covenants and
agreements that require performance in full prior to the Closing, and the
rights of the Parties to seek indemnification with respect thereto, shall
expire on that date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date;
provided that those covenants and agreements which by their terms contemplate
performance after the Closing Date shall survive the Closing indefinitely;
provided, further, that the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3(a)(i) (Organization of Seller), Section 3(a)(ii) (Authorization of
Transaction), Section 3(a)(iv) (Brokers' Fees), Section 3(a)(v) (Holdings
Shares), Section 4(a) (Organization, Qualification, and Corporate Power),
Section 4(b) (Capitalization of Holdings), Section 4(c) (Brokers' Fees),
Section 4(f) (Subsidiaries), Section 4(k) (Tax Matters), and Section
4(p)(i)-(vii) (Employee Matters), as well as Section 3(b)(i) (Organization of
Buyer), Section 3(b)(ii) (Authorization of Transaction) and Section 3(b)(iv)
(Brokers' Fees) shall survive until the expiration of the relevant statute of
limitations. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any
claim for indemnification on account of breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement will survive the applicable expiration date if a Party,
prior to such expiration date, asserts such claim in writing in good faith,
specifying in reasonable detail the basis under this Agreement for such claim.

(f) Exclusive Remedy. Following the Closing, absent Fraud, claims for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 10 and claims for specific
performance of the covenants and obligations of the other Party under this
Agreement will, collectively, be the sole and exclusive remedies for claims
and damages available to Seller and Buyer arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the purchase and sale of the Business or any certificate or
document delivered in connection herewith and all other rights and remedies
(whether at law or equity) are hereby expressly waived.

(g) Insurance and Other Third-Party Recoveries. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement, all Losses
indemnifiable hereunder shall (i) be net of any third-party insurance or
indemnity, contribution or similar proceeds that have been recovered by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification (it being agreed that if third-party insurance or
indemnification, contribution or similar proceeds in respect of such facts are
recovered by the Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying Party's
making of an indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable
indemnification obligation, such proceeds shall be promptly remitted to the
Indemnifying Party to the extent of the indemnification payment made), and the
Indemnified Party shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use, commercially
reasonable efforts to make claims under applicable insurance policies but not
be required to commence legal action or incur any material expenses, and (ii)
be net of any Tax benefit actually realized in the form of a cash Tax refund
or the reduction of cash Taxes otherwise payable by the Indemnified Party or
any Affiliate arising in the Taxable year of the Loss or the two (2)
succeeding Tax years from the facts or circumstances giving rise to such
Losses to be determined by the Indemnified Party reasonably and in good faith
treating the deductions related to the Loss as the last deduction. If any such
Tax benefit is received by an Indemnified Party after an indemnity payment
with respect 

to a Loss has been made, the Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying
Party the amount of such Tax benefit (up to the amount of the Indemnifying
Party's indemnity payment). Upon making any payment to the Indemnified Party
for any indemnification claim pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which
the Indemnified Party may have against any third parties with respect to the
subject matter underlying such indemnification claim, and the Indemnified
Party shall assign any such rights to the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as expressly contemplated
by Section 10(a)(i)(D) with respect to penalties and interest on or with
respect to any unpaid Taxes of any Acquired Company for any period ending
prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall not have any right to indemnification
under this Agreement with respect to, or based on, Taxes to the extent such
Taxes (i) are attributable to a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning on
or after September 30, 2016, (ii) are due to the unavailability in any Tax
period (or portion thereof) beginning on or after September 30, 2016 of any
net operating losses, credit or other Tax attributes from a Tax period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to September 30, 2016, or (iii) result
from transactions or action taken by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including
for the avoidance of doubt, the Acquired Companies) after the Closing that are
not contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 11\. Miscellaneous.

(a) Press Releases and Public Announcements. Neither Party shall issue any
press release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter
of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other Party;
provided, however, that either Party may make any public disclosure it

or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates
and (ii) designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations
hereunder (in any or all of which cases Buyer nonetheless shall remain
responsible for the performance of all of its obligations hereunder).

(e) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts
(including by means of facsimile), each of which shall be deemed an original

shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Parties.
No waiver by either Party of any provision of this Agreement or any default,

virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

(k) Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of Buyer,
Seller, and the Acquired Companies will bear its own costs and expenses

fact known to such counsel arising by reason of such counsel's prior
representation of any Acquired Company or any of their respective Affiliates.
Buyer, for itself, the Acquired Companies and its and their respective

Biddle and Reath LLP, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution, delivery and closing under, or any dispute or proceeding arising

Closing, would be deemed to be privileged communications of such Acquired
Company, and/or its counsel and would not be subject to disclosure to Buyer in
connection with any process relating to a dispute arising under or in
connection with this Agreement or otherwise, shall continue after the Closing
to be privileged communications with such counsel and neither Buyer nor any
Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer shall seek to obtain
the same by any process on the grounds that the privilege attaching to such
communications belongs to such Acquired Company and not Seller. Other than as
explicitly set forth in this Section 11(p), the Parties acknowledge that any
attorney-client privilege attaching as a result of legal counsel representing
any Acquired Company prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing and
continue to be a privilege of such Acquired Company and not Seller after the
Closing.

(q) Alternative Structure. Promptly following the date hereof, the Parties
shall discuss in good faith whether all the capital stock of PLIC NY could be
transferred through a dividend, distribution or otherwise to Seller so that
the closing of the sale of each of the Acquired Companies other than PLIC NY
could occur sooner than the closing of the sale of PLIC NY. If after
considering the applicable legal, regulatory, tax and other considerations
associated with such a change in the structure of the Transaction the Parties
agree that it is in their mutual interest to pursue such an alternative
structure to the Transaction, they shall negotiate in good faith to revise
this Agreement to reflect such agreed upon alternative structure.

LIMITED Guarantee

This limited Guarantee, dated as of [_____________] [•], 2017 (this
"Guarantee"), is entered into by Enstar Group Limited, a Bermuda company (the
"Guarantor"), in favor of Southland National Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Guaranteed Party").

WHEREAS, the Guaranteed Party and Laguna Life Holdings SARL ("Seller") are
parties to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 17, 2017 (the
"Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which the Guaranteed Party is purchasing
from Seller 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Pavonia
Holdings (US), Inc; and

WHEREAS, as a condition to consummating the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement, the parties hereto have agreed to enter into this
Guarantee, pursuant to which the Guaranteed Party will guarantee certain of
the obligations of Seller under the Purchase Agreement on the terms and
subject to the conditions contained in this Guarantee.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein
contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to
be legally bound, do hereby agree as follows:

1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.

2. Guarantee. As an inducement to the Guaranteed Party to enter into the Purchase Agreement and perform its obligations thereunder, the Guarantor hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Guaranteed Party the full and timely payment of any and all of the monetary indemnification obligations of Seller under Section 10(a) of the Purchase Agreement pursuant to and as limited according to Section 10 of the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the "Obligations"). The Guaranteed Party hereby agrees that in no event shall the Guarantor be required to pay any amount to the Guaranteed Party under, in respect of, or in connection with this Guarantee other than as expressly set forth herein. All payments hereunder shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available U.S. dollar funds to an account designated by the Guaranteed Party. Any payments made under this Guarantee shall be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. 

3. Nature of Guarantee. This Guarantee is a guarantee of payment, and not of collection, and except as set forth in Section 4 of this Guarantee, there is no requirement that the Guaranteed Party attempt to collect from Seller before or contemporaneously with attempting to collect from the Guarantor, or otherwise exhaust any of the Guaranteed Party's rights against Seller. Subject to Section 4 of this Guarantee, the Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that (a) the Guaranteed Party may, in its sole discretion, bring and prosecute an action against the Guarantor in respect of the payment of the Obligations, regardless of whether an action is brought against Seller or whether Seller is joined in any such action or actions, and (b) the Guaranteed Party is not obligated to file any claim relating to the Obligations in the event that the Guarantor becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Guaranteed Party to so file shall not affect the Guarantor's obligations hereunder. 

4. Demand. The Guarantor shall have no obligation to make any payment under this Guarantee with respect to an Obligation unless and until the following conditions have been satisfied: (a) the Guaranteed Party is entitled to make, and shall have made, a written demand on Seller with respect to such Obligation, and Seller shall have failed to pay such Obligation in full within 10 Business Days after delivery of such demand; and (b) the Guarantor has received a written demand for payment with respect to such Obligation (a "Demand," and the non-payment of Seller giving rise to such Demand pursuant to Section 4(a) above, a "Seller Payment Default") from the Guaranteed Party in accordance with the terms of this Section 4, whereupon the Guarantor shall pay the amount of such Seller Payment Default promptly following delivery of a Demand (and in any event within five (5) Business Days), subject to any defenses to the payment of the Obligations that are available to Seller under the Purchase Agreement. Nothing contained herein is intended to limit the ability of the Guaranteed Party to make successive Demands. Each Demand made by the Guaranteed Party hereunder shall (i) provide a reasonably detailed statement of the demand made upon Seller under Section 4(a) hereof; (ii) identify the aggregate amount of Obligations subject to such Demand and due from the Guarantor in connection with the Seller Payment Default (or Seller Payment Defaults) to which such Demand relates, and (iii) state the amount of Obligations subject to such Demand that have been paid (if any) as of the date of such Demand. 

5. Changes in Obligations; Certain Waivers.

(a) Except as specifically otherwise provided in this Guarantee, the Guarantor
agrees that:

(i) the Guaranteed Party may, at any time and from time to time, without
further notice to or consent of the Guarantor, extend the time of payment,
performance or discharge of the Obligations, and may also make any agreement
with Seller or the Guarantor for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise,
discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of
the terms thereof or of any agreement between the Guaranteed Party and the
Guarantor or Seller, without in any way affecting the Guarantor's obligations
under this Guarantee or the validity or enforceability of this Guarantee;

(ii) the Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall not be released or
discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by:

(1) the failure or delay on the part of the Guaranteed Party to assert any
claim or demand or to enforce any right, remedy or power against Seller;

(2) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of the Obligations, or
any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or
modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Purchase Agreement or
any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection
with the Obligations;

(3) any change in the legal existence, structure or ownership of Seller;

(4) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding
affecting Seller;

(5) the existence of any claim, set-off or other right which the Guarantor may
have at any time against Seller or any of its Affiliates, whether in
connection with the Obligations or otherwise; or

(6) the adequacy of any means the Guaranteed Party may have of obtaining
payment, performance or discharge in respect of the Obligations.

(iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Guarantor hereby
expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any
applicable Law which would otherwise require any election of remedies by the
Guaranteed Party; and

(iv) the Guarantor waives in advance promptness, diligence, notice of the
acceptance of this Guarantee and of the Obligations, presentment, demand for
payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of
any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind, all defenses which
may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium or other similar
applicable Law now or hereafter in effect or any right to require the
marshalling of assets of Seller and all suretyship defenses generally (other
than the defenses to the payment of the Obligations that are available to
Seller under the Purchase Agreement).

(b) The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and
indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement
and that the waivers set forth in this Guarantee are knowingly made in
contemplation of such benefits.

(c) The Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not directly or
indirectly institute any proceeding asserting or assert as a defense in any
proceeding, and shall cause its Affiliates not to directly or indirectly
institute any proceeding asserting or assert as a defense in any proceeding,
(i) that the Guaranteed Party has an adequate remedy at Law or (ii) the
illegality, invalidity or unenforceability in accordance with its terms of
this Guarantee.

(d) Unless and until all Obligations have been satisfied in full, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Guarantor hereby
unconditionally waives any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire
against Seller with respect to the Obligations that arise from the existence,
payment, performance, discharge or enforcement of the Guarantor's obligations
under or in respect of this Guarantee or any other 

agreement in connection therewith, including any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of the Guaranteed Party against Seller with
respect to the Obligations, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises
in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including the right to
take or receive from Seller with respect to the Obligations, directly or
indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner,
payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, and the
Guarantor shall not exercise any such rights.

(e) The Guaranteed Party hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not
institute, and shall cause its Affiliates not to institute, any proceeding or
bring any other claim arising under, or in connection with, the Purchase
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby against the Guarantor or
any former, current or future equity holder, controlling person, director,
officer, employee, agent, member, manager, general or limited partner,
permitted assignee or Affiliate of the Guarantor (each, a "Non-Recourse Party"
and, collectively the "Non-Recourse Parties"), whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of the
Guaranteed Party against the Guarantor or any Non-Recourse Party by any legal
or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or other
applicable Law, or otherwise, except for (i) the Guaranteed Party's rights to
recover from the Guarantor (but not any other Person) under and to the extent
provided in this Guarantee and subject to the limitations described herein
("Retained Guarantee Claims") and (ii) claims that the Guaranteed Party has
against Seller under the Purchase Agreement (subject to the terms and
conditions thereof) ("Retained Purchase Agreement Claims"). Recourse against
the Guarantor with respect to the Retained Guarantee Claims, subject to the
limitations and conditions set forth herein, and against Seller with respect
to the Retained Purchase Agreement Claims shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the Guaranteed Party and all of its Affiliates against the
Guarantor and any Non-Recourse Party in respect of any liabilities or
obligations arising under, or in connection with, this Guarantee and the
Purchase Agreement or the guarantee contemplated hereby or thereby or in
respect of any representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith.

6. Continuing Guarantee. This Guarantee may not be revoked or terminated (other than pursuant to this Section 6) and shall remain in full force and effect and shall be binding on the Guarantor and its successors and permitted assigns until all of the Obligations have been indefeasibly satisfied and discharged in full, at which time this Guarantee shall terminate without any action by the parties hereto, and the Guarantor shall have no further obligations under this Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without any action by the parties hereto, the Guarantor shall have no further obligations under this Guarantee as of the earlier of (a) payment in full of the Obligations or (b) the date on which Seller's representations, warranties, covenants and agreements under the Purchase Agreement expire pursuant to and subject to the terms of Section 10(e) of the Purchase Agreement; provided however, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Guarantor shall have no further obligations hereunder ten years from the date hereof, Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Guaranteed Party or any of its controlled Affiliates assert in any litigation or other proceeding that the provisions of this Section 6 or Section 5(e) hereof are illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, or asserting any theory of liability against the Guarantor or any Non-Recourse Party with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement other than the Retained Guarantee Claims and the Retained Purchase Agreement Claims, then (i) the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall terminate ab initio and be null and void, and (ii) neither the Guarantor nor any Non-Recourse Party shall have any liability to the Guaranteed Party with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement under this Guarantee or otherwise. 

7. Reimbursement; Set Off. If at any time after (a) Seller has defaulted in making any payment constituting Obligations (a "Defaulted Payment") and (b) the Guarantor has paid such Defaulted Payment pursuant to Section 4 of this Guarantee, the Guaranteed Party receives all or a portion of the Defaulted Payment from Seller, the Guaranteed Party hereby agrees to promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) reimburse the Guarantor in an amount equal to the Defaulted Payment or portion thereof, as the case may be. The Guarantor shall have the right to set off and apply amounts due to it pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 7 as reimbursement for amounts paid against any amounts due from it under this Guarantee. Any sums set off in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7 shall be deemed to have been paid hereunder.

8. Representations and Warranties. The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Guaranteed Party that:

(a) it is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization;

(b) the execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee by the Guarantor
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action; 

(c) the execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee do not
contravene any applicable Laws or any contractual restrictions binding on the
Guarantor or its assets;

(d) all consents, approvals, authorizations, permits of, filings with and
notifications to any Person, including any Governmental Authority, necessary
for the due execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee by such
Guarantor have been obtained or made and all conditions thereof have been duly
complied with, and no other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery
or performance of this Guarantee by the Guarantor;

(e) this Guarantee constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the
Guarantor enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms,
subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at Law); and

(f) the Guarantor has the financial capacity to pay, perform and discharge its
obligations under this Guarantee, and all funds necessary for the Guarantor to
fulfill its obligations under this Guarantee shall be available to the
Guarantor for so long as this Guarantee shall remain in effect in accordance
with Section 6 hereof.

9. Further Assurances. The Guarantor shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, make such filings, execute and deliver such further instruments, and take such further or other actions as may be reasonably necessary to give the Guaranteed Party the full benefit of this Guarantee. 

10. Waivers; Cumulative Rights. Any term or provision of this Guarantee may be waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver or extension shall be validly and sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Guarantee only if, as to either party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The failure of either party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this Guarantee shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Guarantee or any part hereof or the right of either party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Guarantee shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the Guaranteed Party or allowed the Guaranteed Party by Law, in equity or by other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Guaranteed Party at any time or from time to time.

11. Execution in Counterparts. This Guarantee may be executed in two or more counterparts, which may be delivered by means of facsimile or e-mail (or another electronic means such as a PDF file), each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original, but all of which together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.

12. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.

(a) This Guarantee shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

(b) ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS
GUARANTEE MAY BE INSTITUTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA OR THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION
OR PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION
TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS
AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT
ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT
IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS GUARANTEE IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES
AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTEE. EACH PARTY TO THIS GUARANTEE CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A)

EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS GUARANTEE BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE

defense or otherwise) in any such action any claim that service of process
made in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) does not constitute good and valid
service of process.

TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

This Transition Services Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into as of [
], 2017, by and between Enstar Holdings (US) Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Enstar"), and Southland National Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Buyer", and together with Enstar, the "Parties" and each, a "Party").

RECITALS:

A. Buyer entered into that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of [ ],
2017 (the "Purchase Agreement"), with Laguna Life Holdings SARL, an affiliate
of Enstar ("Laguna"), pursuant to which Laguna has agreed to sell, assign,
transfer and convey to Buyer, and Buyer has agreed to purchase and acquire
from Laguna, 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Pavonia
Holdings (US), Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Holdings").

B. Holdings is the record owner of all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of each of Pavonia Life Insurance Company of Michigan, a Michigan
insurance company ("PLIC MI"), and Enstar Life (US), Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Enstar Life"). PLIC MI is the record owner of all of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of Pavonia Life Insurance Company of New York, a
New York insurance company ("PLIC NY" and, together with Holdings, PLIC MI and
Enstar Life, the "Acquired Companies").

C. As a condition to consummating the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement, the Parties have agreed to enter into this Agreement,
pursuant to which Enstar will provide, or cause its Affiliates and third-party
service providers to provide, certain services to the Acquired Companies on a
transitional basis and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein and defined in the Purchase Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.

2. Services. 

(a) Enstar or its Affiliates shall provide, or cause to be provided via third-
party service providers, to the Acquired Companies those transition services
(the "Services") described in Schedule A hereto (as such may be amended or
supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the "Schedule") for the
respective periods (or, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
such shorter period as is necessary for the transition of each such Service,
as determined by Buyer) and on the other terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement and the Schedule. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or the Schedule, Enstar shall have no obligation to provide, or
cause to be provided via third-party service providers, any service, function,
responsibility or task that (i) Enstar or its Affiliates do not provide, or
cause to be provided, to the Acquired Companies as of the date hereof, or (ii)
is in excess of the scope of any service, function, responsibility or task
that Enstar or its Affiliates provide, or cause to be provided, to the
Acquired Companies as of the date hereof as determined by Enstar. Enstar may,
with reasonable advance written notice to Buyer, make (A) any change to the
technical environment used to provide or support the Services, provided that
there is no material adverse effect upon the Services provided to the Acquired
Companies; or (B) any change to the Services if required to ensure the
uninterrupted delivery of the Services or to comply with applicable Law, in
each case without the consent of Buyer or the Acquired Companies.

(b) If Buyer desires to receive any Service beyond the date set forth opposite
such Service on the Schedule (the "Extended Period"), which Extended Period
shall not exceed sixty (60) days following the date set forth opposite such
Service on the Schedule, Buyer shall provide thirty (30) days advance written
notice to Enstar of its desire to obtain such Service for the Extended Period.
If Enstar is capable of providing such Service for the Extended Period, Enstar
shall provide such Service for the Extended Period on the terms and conditions
set forth herein and in the Schedule, and the Schedule shall be deemed amended
to reflect the new Extended Period.

(c) If Buyer desires to receive an additional transition service under this
Agreement that (i) is reasonably necessary to the operation of the Acquired
Companies, (ii) was provided to the Acquired Companies by 

Enstar as of the date hereof, and (iii) Buyer deems necessary to effectuate
the orderly consummation of the transactions contemplated under the Purchase
Agreement (the "Additional Service"), Buyer shall request in writing that
Enstar provide such Additional Service. Enstar shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such Additional Service at a price and for a
period to be agreed upon in writing after good faith negotiations between the
Parties. Each of Buyer and Enstar shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, as soon as reasonably practicable, to negotiate and execute, as
appropriate, a new Schedule with respect to such Additional Service and
addressing, among other things, the scope, duration, and fees in respect
thereof.

3. Affiliates and Third-Party Service Providers. Enstar may satisfy its obligation to provide or procure Services hereunder by causing one or more of its Affiliates or third-party service providers to provide or procure Services, provided that the use of Affiliates or third-party service providers will not result in a material adverse change upon the Services provided to the Acquired Companies. Any use by Enstar of Affiliates or third-party service providers will not relieve Enstar of any of its obligations under this Agreement, and Enstar will remain fully liable (subject to Section 13(c)) for all acts or omissions of its Affiliates and any third-party service providers to the same extent as if such acts or omissions were undertaken by or attributable to Enstar directly.

4. Service Costs. Buyer shall pay Enstar for each Service at the rate specifically described in the Schedule for such Service ("Service Costs"). It is the intent of the Parties that the compensation set forth in the Schedule reasonably approximates the cost of providing the respective Services, including the cost of employee wages and compensation and overhead, without any intent to cause Enstar to receive profit or incur loss. If at any time Enstar believes that the payments contemplated by the Schedule are materially insufficient to compensate it for the cost of providing any Service it is obligated to provide hereunder, Enstar shall promptly notify Buyer, and the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith revisions to the Schedule to reflect sufficient compensation to Enstar for the provision of such Service.

5. Invoicing and Settlement of Costs. Unless otherwise set forth in the Schedule, Enstar shall invoice all Service Costs to Buyer once a month on or before the fifth Business Day following the last Business Day of the month for which such Service Costs were incurred. Buyer shall pay all invoices within 15 days following the date on which the invoice is tendered (each, a "Payment Date"). Buyer shall reimburse Enstar for all reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs of collection incurred by or on behalf of Enstar or its Affiliates as a result of Buyer's failure to timely pay all amounts due and payable hereunder. In the event that Buyer disputes any invoice amount in good faith, Buyer will pay the disputed amount in accordance with this Section 5 and the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve any such dispute.

6. General Standard of Service. The nature, quality, service level and standard of care applicable to the delivery of the Services shall be substantially the same as Enstar or its Affiliates or third-party service providers, as applicable, provided to the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date, so long as the standard of care is, at a minimum, commercially reasonable, unless another standard is specifically provided for in the Schedule with respect to a particular Service. Enstar and its Affiliates or third-party service providers, as applicable, shall comply with all applicable Laws in the provision of Services hereunder. The management of and control over the provision of the Services shall reside solely with Enstar.

7. Personnel and Service Providers. Enstar may employ and/or engage such Persons as have sufficient experience, skill, diligence and expertise to perform the Services. All labor matters relating to employees of Enstar and its Affiliates (including, without limitation, employees involved in the provision of the Services) shall be within the exclusive control of Enstar, and neither Buyer nor the Acquired Companies shall have any responsibility with respect to such matters. All employees and representatives of Enstar, any Affiliate of Enstar or a third-party service provider providing Services shall be deemed for purposes of compensation and employee benefits to be employees or representatives solely of Enstar, such Affiliate or such third-party service provider, respectively, and not to be employees or representatives of Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies, unless otherwise provided for in the Schedule with respect to a particular Service. Any costs of third-party service providers shall be at the expense of Buyer, unless otherwise provided for in the Schedule with respect to a particular Service.

8. Term. The term of this Agreement (the "Term") shall commence on the date hereof and shall terminate as of the earlier of (a) the date that the provision of all Services has been discontinued in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the Schedule) or (b) the termination of the Agreement pursuant to Section 9 below. Enstar shall provide each Service only for the duration specified for such Service in the Schedule, or such shorter period as the Parties shall otherwise agree in writing. 

9. Termination. 

(a) Buyer may terminate this Agreement with respect to a particular Service or
in its entirety upon giving at least 30 days' prior written notice to Enstar,
unless another notice period is provided for in the Schedule with respect to
such Service.

(b) In the event that Enstar shall have failed to perform any of its material
obligations under this Agreement (including the Schedule) and has not cured
such failure within 10 days following Enstar's receipt of notice of such
failure from Buyer, Buyer may at any time terminate this Agreement with
respect to a particular Service or in its entirety upon written notice of
termination to Buyer.

(c) In the event that Buyer shall have failed to perform any of its material
obligations under this Agreement (including the Schedule) and has not cured
such failure within 30 days following Buyer's receipt of notice of such
failure from Enstar, Enstar may at any time terminate this Agreement with
respect to a particular Service or in its entirety upon written notice of
termination to Buyer.

10. Effect of Termination. Upon expiration or proper termination of any Service or this Agreement, Enstar shall have no further obligation to provide, or cause the provision of, the expired or terminated Service(s) and Buyer shall have no obligation to pay any fees relating to such Service(s) or make any other payments hereunder; provided, that, notwithstanding such expiration or termination, Buyer shall remain liable to Enstar for all Service Costs incurred prior to the effective date of the termination or expiration (which will be payable in accordance with the invoicing and payment terms set forth in Section 5); and each Party will promptly return, or cause to be returned, to the other Party or, at such other Party's option, destroy, all tangible personal property and books, records or files owned or provided by such other Party, its Affiliates or third parties pursuant to this Agreement.

11. Software Licenses. Enstar shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such licenses or other authority as shall be necessary for Enstar to grant to the Acquired Companies access to, or use of, any software used in the performance of Services by Enstar hereunder to the extent such software is not owned or licensed by the Acquired Companies as of the Closing. Buyer shall (a) bear all of Enstar's costs and expenses associated with obtaining such licenses or other authority, (b) comply with all terms and conditions applicable to use of the software, and (c) indemnify, defend and hold Enstar and its Affiliates harmless from any and all claims and liability arising from or relating to use of the software by the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates, including, but not limited to, all claims arising from the Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates violating any terms or conditions of use of the software that are imputed to Enstar or any Affiliate thereof as the primary licensor of such software. Losses arising from each of the foregoing clauses (a) through (c) shall not be subject to the limitations on types and amounts of liability as set forth in Section 13(d) of this Agreement. Enstar's failure to obtain the right for the Acquired Companies to access or use any software, after the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement. Neither Enstar nor its Affiliates shall have any obligation to assign, transfer or license, or consent to be assigned, transferred or licensed, any software to the Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates.

12. Confidential Information. 

(a) "Confidential Information" shall mean all confidential or proprietary
information, materials and processes relating to either Party or any Affiliate
of such Party obtained by the other Party or any Affiliate of such other Party
at any time (whether prior to or after the date hereof and whether in
connection with this Agreement or otherwise) in any format whatsoever (whether
orally, visually, in writing, electronically or in any other form) and shall
include, without limitation, economic and business information or data,
business plans, computer software and information relating to employees,
vendors, customers, products, financial performance and projections,
processes, strategies and systems, but shall not include (i) information which
becomes generally available to the public other than by release in violation
of the provisions of this Section 12, (ii) information which becomes available
on a non-confidential basis to a Party from a source other than the other
Party to this Agreement, provided such source is not or was not bound to hold
such information confidential or that the Party reasonably believed such
source not to be so bound, and (iii) information acquired or developed
independently by a Party without violating this Section 12 or any other
confidentiality agreement with the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer shall not be required to hold as confidential or be restricted in the
use of any information purchased and owned by Buyer under the Purchase
Agreement.

(b) The Parties hereby covenant and agree to hold in trust and keep
confidential (and to cause each of their respective Affiliates and their
respective shareholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees and
agents to hold in trust and keep confidential) all Confidential Information
relating to the other Party or any of such 

other Party's Affiliates, and not to use any such Confidential Information
other than for such purposes as may be expressly permitted hereunder. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Confidential Information relating to
a Party or any of its Affiliates shall be disclosed only to those employees
and representatives (including without limitation any third-party service
providers of Enstar or its Affiliates) of the other Party who need to know
such information for the purpose of providing the Services hereunder and in no
event shall any such Confidential Information be disclosed to any other
Person. Each Party will ensure that such employees and representatives are
made aware of and observe the confidentiality obligations in this Section 12.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 12 to the contrary, a Party may
disclose such portion of the Confidential Information relating to the other
Party to the extent the disclosing Party reasonably believes that such
disclosure is required by applicable law; provided, however, that to the
extent permitted, the disclosing Party shall first notify the other Party of
such requirement and allow such Party a reasonable opportunity to seek a
protective order or other appropriate remedy to prevent such disclosure. The
Parties acknowledge that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for
any breach of the provisions of this Section 12 and that the non-breaching
Party shall be entitled to equitable relief in a court of law in the event of,
or to prevent, a breach of this Section 12.

(c) The confidentiality and other obligations described in this Section 12
shall apply during the Term and for two (2) years thereafter.

13. Indemnification; Limitation of Liability.

(a) Indemnification by Enstar. Enstar shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Buyer and its Affiliates and, if applicable, their respective
directors, officers, shareholders and employees (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnified Parties") from, against and in respect of, any third-party claims
for costs, damages, fees, losses and liabilities (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs of defense and investigation)
imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by or asserted against any of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties, directly or indirectly, relating to or arising out
of:

(i) the gross negligence or reckless, wanton or willful misconduct (including,
without limitation, fraud, embezzlement, or theft) of Enstar with respect to
the performance of its obligations under this Agreement;

(ii) Enstar's breach of its obligations under this Agreement relating to
compliance with Laws; and

(iii) a breach by Enstar of Section 12.

(b) Indemnification by Buyer. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Enstar and its Affiliates and, if applicable, their respective directors,
officers, shareholders and employees (collectively, the "Enstar Indemnified
Parties") from, against and in respect of, any third-party claims for costs,
damages, fees, losses and liabilities (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees, costs of defense and investigation) imposed on,
sustained, incurred or suffered by or asserted against any of the Enstar
Indemnified Parties, directly or indirectly, relating to or arising out of:

(i) the gross negligence or reckless, wanton or willful misconduct (including,
without limitation, fraud, embezzlement, or theft) of Buyer with respect to
the performance of its obligations under this Agreement;

(ii) Buyer's breach of its obligations under this Agreement relating to
compliance with Laws; and

(iii) a breach by Buyer of Section 12.

(c) Limitation of Liability. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
Enstar's total liability for any and all claims arising out of or related to
this Agreement will not exceed, for all claims in the aggregate, the total
amount of Service Costs paid by Buyer under this Agreement.

(d) Exculpation. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY
SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY), OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR 

CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF DATA,
LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF CUSTOMER OR CLIENTS, LOSS OF GOODWILL OR LOSS OF
PROFITS, DAMAGE TO OR LOSS OF USE OF ANY PROPERTY, ANY INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF
SERVICE, OR ANY LOSS OF BUSINESS, HOWSOEVER CAUSED, OR ARISING IN ANY MANNER
FROM THIS AGREEMENT AND THE PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS
HEREUNDER OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE ANY SERVICE DIRECTLY OR
THROUGH AN AFFILIATE OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER.

(e) Duty to Mitigate Damages. Each Party will have a duty to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate damages incurred by it and for which the other
Party is responsible.

14. Ingress and Egress. Enstar (and its Affiliates and third-party service providers) shall at all times during the Term have the right of reasonable ingress to and egress from the premises of the Acquired Companies, during the regular business hours of each Acquired Company and upon reasonable prior notice, for any purposes required for the delivery of Services under, the exercise of any right under, or the performance of any obligations required by this Agreement.

15. Disclaimer of Warranties. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, THE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE FURNISHED "AS IS, WHERE IS," WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, ENSTAR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE QUALITY, SUITABILITY OR ADEQUACY OF THE SERVICES FOR ANY PURPOSE OR USE.

16. Force Majeure. Neither Enstar nor Buyer shall be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder, or any failure or delay in the performance of any Service provided by an Affiliate of Enstar or a third-party service provider, to the extent that and so long as such failure or delay is caused by or results from any cause whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of such Party, Affiliate or third-party service provider, including but not limited to, riot, war or hostilities between any nations, embargoes, government orders or regulations, acts of God, fire, accidents, or strikes, differences with workmen, delays of carriers, lack of transportation facilities, inability to obtain materials, or curtailment of or failure in obtaining sufficient power (each, an "Event"); provided, however, that the Party, Affiliate or third-party service provider experiencing the Event shall give the other Party prompt notice of the interruption and the cause thereof and shall use reasonable means to resume full performance of its obligations under this Agreement as soon as possible. Once an Event ceases, such Party will promptly resume performance of its affected obligations as soon as reasonably practicable. The applicable termination date for any Service so suspended will be automatically extended for a period of time equal to the time lost by reason of the suspension.

17. No Agency. Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute or be deemed to constitute a partnership or joint venture between the Parties or constitute or be deemed to constitute either Party the agent or employee of the other for any purpose whatsoever and neither Party shall have authority or power to bind the other or to contract in the name of, or create a liability against, the other in any way or for any purpose.

18. No Employment Relationship. Enstar is providing professional services on behalf of the Acquired Companies. Neither Enstar nor the employees of Enstar or any of its Affiliates or third-party service providers are or shall be deemed to be employees of Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies. Enstar and its Affiliates and third-party service providers shall be solely responsible for managing and supervising their respective employees and for the payment of compensation (including provision for employment taxes, federal, state and local income taxes, workers compensation and any similar taxes) associated with the employment of Enstar's employees and those of its Affiliates and third-party service providers. Likewise, neither the Acquired Companies nor employees of the Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates are or shall be deemed to be employees of Enstar or any of its Affiliates or third-party service providers. Each Acquired Company shall be solely responsible for managing and supervising its employees and for compliance with all laws (including compensation laws) associated with the employment of such Acquired Company's employees.

19. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Purchase Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and negotiations, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

20. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts (including by means of telecopied signature pages or electronic transmission in portable document format (pdf)), any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one Party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and the same instrument.

21. Notices. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been given (a) when personally delivered, (b) the day following the day (except if not a Business Day then the next Business Day) on which the same has been delivered prepaid to a reputable national overnight air courier service or (c) the third Business Day following the day on which the same is sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid.

22. No Third-Party Beneficiaries or Right to Rely. Certain provisions of Section 13 of this Agreement are intended for the benefit of the Enstar Indemnified Parties and Buyer Indemnified Parties. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the Parties and the Enstar Indemnified Parties and Buyer Indemnified Parties any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

23. Amendment; Waiver; Assignment.

(a) This Agreement (including the Schedule) shall not be amended or otherwise
modified without each Party executing a written amendment hereto setting forth
the terms of such amendment or modification. 

(b) No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement (i) shall be deemed
or shall constitute a waiver of such provision at any time in the future or a
waiver of any other provision hereof or (ii) shall be effective unless in
writing and executed by the waiving Party.

(c) Except as specifically permitted elsewhere in this Agreement, neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or
delegated by either Party without the prior written consent of the other
Party, provided, however, that either Party may without the consent of the
other Party assign any or all of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer and Enstar shall each remain fully responsible for compliance with the
terms of this Agreement in the same manner as if such delegation or
designation were not effected. Any purported assignment or delegation in
breach of the foregoing shall be void and of no effect.

24. Governing Law. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements executed and performed entirely within such State.

25. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each Party hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

26. Conflicts. In the event of any conflicts between or among this Agreement, the Schedule and the Purchase Agreement, the terms of the Purchase Agreement will control as to the obligations of the Parties.

27. Titles; Interpretive Issues. The titles appearing at the beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions of this Agreement and the Schedule are for convenience only, do not constitute any part of this Agreement or the Schedule, and will be disregarded in construing the language hereof and thereof. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) each Party and its counsel have reviewed the terms and provisions of this Agreement and have contributed to its drafting, (b) the normal rule of construction, to the effect that any ambiguities are resolved against the drafting Party, shall not be employed in the interpretation of it, and (c) the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be construed fairly as to the Parties and not in favor of or against either Party, regardless of which Party was generally responsible for the preparation of this Agreement. 

28. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and the Parties will amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any prohibited or invalid provision with an effective and valid provision that gives effect to the intent of the Parties to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

29. Survivability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, following provisions of this Agreement will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement: Sections 4, 5, 12, 13 and 15-29.
