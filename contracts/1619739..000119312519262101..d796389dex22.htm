(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, New HESM shall

_Exchange Agent_ ") for the benefit of the holders of Public Unitholder HESM
Units, an aggregate number of New HESM Class A Shares to be issued to such
holders in uncertificated form or book-entry form. In addition, New HESM shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from
time to time after the Effective Time, any distributions, if any, to which the
holders of Public Unitholder HESM Units may be entitled pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7(c)_ with both a record and payment date after the Effective Time and

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three
Business Days thereafter), New HESM shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of Public Unitholder HESM Units that are represented by
(i) a certificate formerly representing any of the Public Unitholder HESM
Units (a " _Certificate_ ") or (ii) a book-entry account formerly
representing any non-certificated Public Unitholder HESM Units (a " _Book-_
_Entry Unit_ ") not held through The Depositary Trust Company (" _DTC_ ")
notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including (A)
appropriate transmittal materials specifying that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to such Public Unitholder HESM Units shall pass
only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates, as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7(f)_) or transfer of the Book-
Entry Unit to the Exchange Agent (including customary provisions with respect
to delivery of an "agentÂ’s message" with respect to Book-Entry Units), such
materials to be in such form and have such other provisions as New HESM
desires with approval of HESM (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (B)
instructions for surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates) or transferring the Book-Entry Units to the Exchange
Agent in exchange for the New HESM Class A Shares to be issued in
consideration therefor and distributions, in each case, to which such holders
are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. With respect to Book-
Entry Units held through DTC, New HESM and HESM shall cooperate to establish
procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent
will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date (or if Closing occurs
after 11:30 a.m. (New York Time) on the Closing Date, on the first Business
Day after the Closing Date), upon surrender of Public Unitholder HESM Units
held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTCÂ’s customary
surrender procedures, the New HESM Class A Shares to be issued in
consideration therefor and distributions, in each case, to which the
beneficial owners thereof are entitled pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

 

(ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Public Unitholder HESM Units
that are represented by Certificates, by physical surrender of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate, as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 7(f)_) or that are represented by Book-Entry Units, by book-
receipt of an "agentÂ’s message" in customary form by the Exchange Agent in
connection with the transfer of Book-Entry Units, in accordance with the terms
of the Letter of Transmittal and accompanying instructions or, with respect to
Book-Entry Units held through DTC, in accordance with DTCÂ’s customary
procedures (it being understood that the holders of Book-Entry Units shall be
deemed to have surrendered such units upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of
such "agentÂ’s message" or such other evidence, if any, as the Exchange Agent
may reasonably request) and such other procedures as agreed by New HESM, HESM,
the Exchange Agent and DTC, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Units
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the number of New HESM
Class A Shares that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 5_ and (ii) cash in the amount of (after giving effect to any required
Tax withholdings as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 7(g)_) any unpaid
distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7(c)_.

 

(iii) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of Public Unitholder HESM Units and any Certificate or ledger entry
relating to Book-Entry Units formerly representing HESM Common Units that have
been so surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange Agent.

 

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of certificated Public
Unitholder HESM Units that are not registered in the transfer records of
HESM, the proper number of New HESM Class A Shares, together with any cash
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_
__ _ 7(g)_) to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate and any
distributions in respect thereof, may be issued and/or paid to such a
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Public Unitholder
HESM Units is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable unit transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each
case, in form and substance, reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent.
With respect to Book-Entry Units, payment of the New HESM Class A Shares to
be issued in consideration therefor and any distributions pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7(c)_ shall only be

 



4

    

 made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Units are registered in the
unit transfer books of HESM. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 7(b)(iv)_, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Unit shall be
deemed from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender thereof, (i) the number of New HESM Class A Shares
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5_ and
(ii) cash in the amount of (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7(g)_) any unpaid distributions
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7(c)_.

(c) _Distributions_. All New HESM Class A Shares to be issued pursuant to
the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time,
and whenever a distribution is declared by New HESM in respect of the New HESM
Class A Shares, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time,
such declaration shall include distributions in respect of all New HESM Class
A Shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No distributions in respect of
the New HESM Class A Shares shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
Public Unitholder HESM Units until the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7(f)_) or Book-Entry
Unit is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7_.
Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following such
surrender, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of record of the
New HESM Class A Shares issued in exchange for Public Unitholder HESM Units
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7_, without interest, (i) at the time
of such surrender, the distributions in respect of New HESM Class A Shares
with a record date at or after the Effective Time and payment date prior to
or on the date of surrender, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
distributions payable with respect to such New HESM Class A Shares with a
record date at or after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent
to the date of surrender.

(d) _Transfers_. At the Effective Time, HESM shall cause the unit
transfer books of the Surviving Entity to be closed immediately, and from and
after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the unit transfer
books of HESM of the Public Unitholder HESM Units that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund and any
New HESM Class A Shares) that remains unclaimed twelve months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to New HESM and, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall remain outstanding in accordance with the terms of the New HESM
Partnership Agreement. Any holder of Public Unitholder HESM Units that has not
theretofore complied with this _Section_ __ _ 7_ shall thereafter look only
to New HESM for delivery of the New HESM Class A Shares issuable as
consideration therefor and payment of any distributions in respect thereof
payable and/or issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5_ and _Section_ __ _
7(c)_, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Entity, New HESM, the Exchange Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Public Unitholder HESM
Units for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. If any Certificate or
Book-Entry Unit has not been surrendered prior to the date on which the New
HESM Class A Shares issuable as consideration therefor would escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority, such New HESM Class A
Shares issuable as consideration therefor and the cash, if any, to be paid in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Unit pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
7(c)_ shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to
such time become the property of New HESM, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
representing Public Unitholder HESM Units shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by New HESM,
the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms
as may be required by New HESM as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the New HESM Class A
Shares issuable as consideration therefor and any unpaid distributions that
would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement
had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

 



5

    

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of New HESM, the Surviving Entity and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law (and to the extent
deduction and withholding is required, such deduction and withholding may be
taken in New HESM Class A Shares). To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by New HESM, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts (a) shall be timely remitted by New HESM, the Surviving
Entity or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental
Authority, and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was made.
If withholding is taken in New HESM Class A Shares, New HESM, the Surviving
Entity or the Exchange Agent shall be treated as having sold such New HESM
Class A Shares for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such
New HESM Class A Shares at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash
proceeds to the appropriate Governmental Authority. 

(h) _No Dissenters Â’ Rights_. No dissentersÂ’ or appraisal rights shall be
available as a result of or with respect to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

8. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time and termination in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10_, the issued and outstanding limited partner interests of HESM or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable therefor or the issued and outstanding limited partner interests of New HESM or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable therefor, shall have been changed into a different number of units or securities or a different class by reason of any reclassification, unit split (including a reverse unit split), unit distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, or a distribution paid in units with a record date within such period shall have been declared, then the applicable consideration payable in connection with the Merger pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 5_ shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of limited partner interests of HESM and New HESM the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. For the avoidance of any doubt, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this _Section_ __ _ 8_ shall not apply to, and nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit, the issuance of limited partner interests in New HESM for cash or cash equivalents or in connection with the issuance of equity compensation. 

9. _Additional Actions_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Parties shall take all such reasonable and lawful actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to comply with the requirements of the DRULPA and the DLLCA. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Entity its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of Merger Sub, or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the Surviving Entity shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Merger Sub and HESM, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of Merger Sub and HESM or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Entity or otherwise to carry out this Agreement. 

 

10. _Termination_. This Agreement shall be terminated, and the Merger shall be abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time upon the termination of the Partnership Restructuring Agreement in accordance with its terms. In the event of such termination and abandonment, this Agreement shall become void and none of the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, managers, members, partners or officers, as the case may be, shall have any liability with respect to such termination and abandonment except as otherwise provided in the other Transaction Documents. 

 

11. _Amendment and Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may, to the extent permitted by the DRULPA and the DLLCA, be supplemented, amended or modified only by the written 

 



6

    

 agreement of all the Parties. Each such instrument shall be reduced to
writing and shall be designated on its face as an amendment to this Agreement.
Any extension or waiver of the obligations herein of any Party shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing referring to this section and
executed by the Party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition
shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent
waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or
condition, of this Agreement. The failure of any Party to assert any of its
rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

 

12. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law. 

13. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other Parties. 

14. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this Agreement are intended to bind the Parties as to each other and are not intended to and do not create rights in any other Person or confer upon any other Person any benefits, rights or remedies (other than with respect to the rights of holders of Phantom Units and Public Unitholder HESM Units to receive the New HESM Phantom Shares and New HESM Class A Shares, respectively, and any distribution equivalent right and distribution attributable to such New HESM Phantom Shares or New HESM Class A Shares to which such Persons are entitled, in each case, after the Closing, pursuant to Sections 5 through 7 and on the other terms and subject to the conditions hereof, it being acknowledged that no claim with respect to any of the foregoing rights may be made unless and until the Closing has occurred), and no Person is or is intended to be a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 

 

15. _Headings_. The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

16. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be valid and effective under Applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, and the Parties shall negotiate in good faith with a view to substitute for such provision a suitable and equitable solution in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision. 

 

17. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Partnership Restructuring Agreement, each of the other Transaction Documents and each of the other instruments referenced herein and therein supersede all previous understandings or agreements among the Parties, whether oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement, the Partnership Restructuring Agreement, each of the other Transaction Documents and each of the other instruments contain the entire understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. There are no unwritten oral agreements between the Parties. No understanding, representation, promise or agreement, whether oral or written, is intended to be or shall be included in or form part of this Agreement unless it is contained in a written amendment hereto executed by the Parties hereto after the date of this Agreement. 

18. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall be deemed one agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic image scan shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
