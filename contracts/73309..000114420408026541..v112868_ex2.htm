during normal business hours of Buyer's personnel or the  personnel of such
Affiliate of Buyer.

 

 

(d) Buyer  shall provide Seller with such documentation as Seller may

request and (ii) provide the other with a description of the information

covenant and agree, with respect to a threatened or pending preliminary  or
permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule, 
regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the ability of the 
Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, to use their 
reasonable best efforts to prevent or lift the entry, enactment or

Section  5.5 _Public  Announcements_.  Except  as otherwise agreed to by
the Parties, the Parties shall not issue any report,  statement or press
release or otherwise make any public statements with respect  to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, except as in the

advance of  such required disclosure.

 

 

Section  5.6 _Buyer  Knowledge_.  Buyer  has, as a result of its receipt
of information provided by Seller to Buyer  pursuant to Buyer's due
diligence, no actual knowledge as of the date hereof of  any breach by Seller
of any representation or warranty set forth in Article  III.  Should, prior
to the Closing, Buyer obtain actual knowledge of a breach by  Seller of any
representation or warranty set forth in Article III as a result  of  its
receipt of information provided by Seller to Buyer following the date 
hereof, then Buyer promptly shall notify Seller in writing of the existence 
of  such breach.

 

 

Section  5.7 _Tax  Matters_. 

 

 

(a) _Tax  Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_.  Buyer  shall, at
its own expense, prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file  or  cause
to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for all  periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date that have not yet been filed  and 
are required to be filed after the Closing Date. Provided that Buyer has 
complied with the procedures outlined in Section 5.7(c) hereof, Buyer shall 
be  reimbursed by Seller for Taxes of the Acquired Companies required to be
paid  (less  any  prepayment of Taxes and any  Taxes  attributable to the
period from January 1, 2008 until the Closing Date) as  shown  on the Tax
Returns described in the preceding sentence within fifteen (15)  days  after
receipt by Seller of notice from Buyer stating that payment by Buyer  or 
the applicable Acquired Company of such Taxes has been made.

 

 

(b) _Tax  Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_. 
Buyer  shall, at its own expense, prepare or cause to be prepared and timely
file  or  cause timely to be filed any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies
for Tax  periods that begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing
Date.  Provided Buyer has complied with the procedures outlined in Section
5.7(c)  hereof, Buyer shall be reimbursed by Seller for an amount equal to
the portion  of the Taxes (less any prepayment of Taxes) shown as due on such
Tax Returns  that relate to the portion of such Taxable period ending on
December 31,  2007 within fifteen (15) days after receipt by Seller of notice
from Buyer  that  payment by Buyer or the applicable Acquired Company of
such Taxes has been  made.  For purposes of this Section 5.7(b) and Section
8.1(d), in the case of any  Income Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis
and are payable for a Taxable  period that includes (but does not end on)
December 31, 2007, the portion of  such Income Tax that relates to the
portion of such Taxable period ending on  December 31, 2007 shall be deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable  if  the relevant Taxable period
ended on December 31, 2007. The portion of any  Taxes  other than Income Tax
that relates to the period ending on December 31, 2007  shall be determined
on a daily pro rata basis. Any credits or estimated tax  payments relating to
a Taxable period that begins before and ends after December  31, 2007 shall
be taken into account as though the relevant Taxable period  ended  on
December 31, 2007. All determinations necessary to give effect to the 
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice  of the applicable Acquired Company.

(c) _Preparation  of Tax Returns_.  Buyer  shall provide Seller with copies
of any Tax Returns to be filed pursuant to  this  Section 5.7, along with
all schedules, statements, workpapers and supporting  documentation (the "
_Supporting  Documentation_ "),  prior  to the filing of any such Tax
Return and at least sixty (60) days prior to  the  due date thereof (giving
effect to any extensions thereto). Seller shall have  the right to review any
such Tax Return and Supporting Documentation prior  to  the filing of such
Tax Return. If Seller disputes any item(s) shown on any  such  Tax Return,
Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use commercially 
reasonable efforts to resolve any issues arising as a result of the review 
of  such Tax Return and to mutually consent to the filing as promptly as
possible  of  such Tax Return. If such Parties are unable to resolve any
dispute within thirty  (30) days after the receipt by Seller of the Tax
Return proposed to be filed,  such dispute shall be resolved by the
Independent Accountant, which shall  resolve any issue in dispute as promptly
as practicable. If the Independent  Accountant is unable to make a
determination with respect to any disputed issue  prior to the due date
(including any extensions) for the filing of the Tax  Return in question, (i)
Buyer shall file, or shall cause to be filed, such  Tax Return without such
determination having been made and (ii) Seller  shall pay to Buyer an amount
equal to the amount of Taxes not in dispute with  respect to such Tax Return
in accordance with Section 5.7(a) or 5.7(b), as  the case may be. Upon the
Independent Accountant's delivery of its determination  to Buyer and Seller,
appropriate adjustments shall be made to the amount paid  in  accordance
with Section 5.7(a) or 5.7(b), as the case may be, in order to  reflect the
Independent Accountant's determination. If such determination  reflects an
overpayment by Seller pursuant to Section 5.7(a) or 5.7(b), Buyer  shall
promptly pay, or shall cause the applicable Acquired Company to promptly  pay
to Seller such overpayment amount. The determination by the Independent 
Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The fees 
and  expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be shared equally by Buyer
and  Seller. Each such Party shall indemnify the other for any interest or
penalties  imposed by any taxing authority resulting from a Party's failure
to deliver Tax  Returns in a timely manner as provided in this Section.

 

 

(d) _Certain  Taxes_.  All  transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes  and  fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this  Agreement shall be paid by Buyer
when due, and Buyer will, at its own expense,  file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all  such  transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes  and  fees, and, if
required by applicable Law, Seller will, and will cause their  Affiliates to,
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other  documentation.

(e) _Refunds  and Tax Benefits_.  Any Tax  refunds that are received by
Buyer or any Acquired Company, and any amounts  credited against Tax to which
Buyer or any Acquired Company becomes entitled  (including any interest paid
or credited with respect thereto), that relate  to  Tax periods or portions
thereof ending on or before December 31, 2007 shall  be  for the account of
Seller, and Buyer shall pay over to Seller any such refund  or  amount of
any such credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement 
thereto. Any such refunds or credits relating to Tax periods or portions
thereof  beginning before and ending after December 31, 2007 shall be
equitably  apportioned between Buyer and Seller.

 

 

(f) _Amendments  to Returns; Refund Claims_.  Following the Closing, Buyer
shall not file an amended Tax Return with respect  to Taxes of any Acquired
Company for a Tax period ending on or before the  Closing Date without
compliance with the disclosure, review and dispute  resolution procedures set
out in Section 5.7(c) hereof. Upon written request  of  Seller, Buyer shall,
at Seller's expense, cause the relevant entity to file for,  and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and expedite the receipt  of,  any
refund to which any Acquired Company may be entitled with respect to Tax 
periods or portions thereof ending on or before December 31, 2007.

 

 

(g) _Purchase  Price Adjustment_.  Any  amount paid pursuant to this
Section 5.7 shall be treated as an adjustment  to  the Purchase Price for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

 

 

Section  5.8 _Preservation  of Records_.  Except  as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, Buyer agrees that it shall, and it  shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, (a) preserve and keep the records  (including all Tax and
accounting records) of the Acquired Companies for a  period of seven years
from the Closing, or for any longer periods as may be  required by any
Governmental Entity or ongoing litigation, and (b) make such  records
available to Seller, during normal business hours and under the  supervision
of Buyer personnel, as may be reasonably required by Seller. If  Buyer or an
Acquired Company wishes to destroy such records after the time  specified
above, Buyer shall first give sixty (60) days' prior written notice to 
Seller and Seller shall have the right at its option and expense, upon prior 
written notice given to Buyer within that sixty (60)-day period, to take 
possession of the records within ninety (90) days after the date of Seller's 
notice to Buyer.

 

 

Section  5.9 _Employees;  Employee Benefits_.

 

 

(a) Effective  as of the Closing Date and for a period of two (2) years
following the Closing  Date, Buyer shall (i) provide to substantially all
Continued Employees  compensation and benefits that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate,  to the aggregate compensation and benefits
that were provided to such Continued  Employees on the Closing Date and (ii)
not terminate in the aggregate during  such period more than ten percent
(10%) of the aggregate workforce of the  Acquired Companies.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-26-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) If  Buyer  does not continue the Company Benefit Plans after the Closing
Date,  (i) Buyer will cause the benefit plans applicable to the Continued 
Employees to recognize all previous service with the Company, a Subsidiary 
or  any of their respective Affiliates for the purpose of determining
eligibility  for and entitlement to succeeding benefits, including vesting
(provided that  service with the Company, a Subsidiary or any of their
respective Affiliates  shall not be counted for purposes of benefit accrual
under any pension plan  of  Buyer); (ii) Buyer shall cause its group health
plan to recognize all  deductibles and coinsurance payments accrued by the
Continued Employees prior  to  the Closing Date and to waive any preexisting
condition limitations for the  Continued Employees; (iii) for the remainder
of the calendar year in which  the  Closing occurs and for the succeeding
year, the vacation, paid time off and  holiday plan offered to Continued
Employees shall be substantially comparable  to  and in place of what an
Acquired Company or any of its respective Affiliates,  as  applicable, would
have provided the Continued Employees had they remained  employees of the
Company, a Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates;  (iv) Buyer
shall maintain for at least two years starting on the Closing  Date
substantially comparable severance arrangements applicable to the Continued 
Employees that were in effect immediately before the Closing Date; and (v) 
after  the second anniversary of the Closing Date, subject to applicable Law,
Buyer  shall provide Continued Employees with base salary and overall
benefits  (including retiree benefits) that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate,  than  those then provided to similarly-situated employees of
Buyer.

 

 

(c) If  Buyer  does not continue the Company Benefit Plans after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall  credit each Continued Employee with such number of unused
vacation days and  other paid time off accrued by such employee with the
applicable Acquired  Company or any of its Affiliates prior to the Closing
Date in accordance with  the personnel policies of the Company, a Subsidiary
or any of their respective  Affiliates applicable to such employees on the
date hereof.

 

 

Section  5.10 _Further  Assurances_.  Each of  the Parties hereto shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or  cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things  necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law, and to execute and deliver  such documents
and other papers, as may be required to carry out the provisions  of this
Agreement and consummate and make effective the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

 

Section  5.11 _Non-Competition_.

 

 

(a) _Covenant_.  For and  in consideration of receipt of the Purchase Price,
Seller hereby grants to  Buyer  a covenant not to compete (the " _Covenant_
")  on the  terms and conditions set forth in this Section 5.11. The parties
recognize  and  agree that Buyer would not be willing to enter into this
Agreement nor  consummate the transactions contemplated hereby without Seller
entering into  the  Covenant and that Seller's performance and observance of
this Section 5.11 is  valuable consideration for Buyer and Buyer's
willingness to enter into this  Agreement and pay the Purchase Price to
Seller. __

 

 

(b) _Non-Competition_.  Seller  covenants and agrees that, for and during
the period of time commencing on  the  Closing Date and expiring five (5)
years thereafter (the " _Term_ "),  Seller shall not, directly or indirectly,
whether individually or in partnership  or association with any one or more
persons or entities, or as a principal,  partner, shareholder, agent,
employee, consultant, or contractor, or in any  other capacity, engage in or
carry on in the Restricted Territory (as defined  below) the Business;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that an  ownership interest of less than five
percent (5%) of the outstanding stock  of  any publicly traded corporation
that is engaged in the Business shall not be  deemed to violate this Section
5.11(b), so long as no officer or director of  such Seller or any of its
Affiliates is a member of the board of directors  (or  other similar
governing body) of such publicly traded corporation.

(c) _No  Interference with an Acquired Company_. **** Seller  covenants and
agrees that, for and during the three (3) year period commencing  on the
Closing Date, Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) in  connection
with the Business solicit or otherwise interfere with any  relationship
between any Acquired Company, on the one hand, and any supplier  or 
customer of an Acquired Company, on the other hand; (ii) solicit  for
employment (or assist anyone in soliciting the employment) any individual 
employed by an Acquired Company as of the Closing Date; or (iii) induce, or 
assist anyone in inducing, any individual employed by an Acquired Company as 
of  the Closing Date to resign or sever employment, or to terminate or breach
any  employment agreement, with an Acquired Company; _provided_ ,  _however_
  that  such restrictions shall only apply to the  relationships of the
Acquired Companies, existing in connection with the  Business as engaged in
by the Acquired Companies prior to or on the Closing  Date; _provided_ , 
_further_ ,  that  general advertisement or solicitation programs conducted
by or on behalf of  Seller or its Affiliates that are not specifically
directed toward the employees  of the Acquired Companies shall not be deemed
to violate this  Section 5.11(c).

 

 

(d) _No  Financing of a Competing Business_.  Seller  further covenants and
agrees that, for and during the Term of the Covenant,  Seller shall not,
directly or indirectly, lend  money to  any  Person engaged, directly or

and acknowledge the terms of this Section 5.11 are  reasonable in scope, time
and territory, and are necessary to protect the value  of the Company Shares
and related assets and Business purchased by Buyer. The  Parties further
acknowledge and agree that it is not their intention that the  Covenant
violate any public policy or statutory or common law. If a court of 
competent jurisdiction renders a ruling (sustained on appeal, if any)
holding  that any one or more of the provisions of the Covenant, including
the Restricted  Territory or stated term of the Covenant, constitute an
unreasonable  restriction, then the Parties specifically agree that the
Covenant shall not  be  rendered void but shall apply to such extent and as
to such time period and  Restricted Territory as such court may determine
constitutes a reasonable  restriction under the circumstances.

Acquired Company, whether by merger,  recapitalization, arrangement,
amalgamation, purchase of equity securities,  purchase of assets or
otherwise, (b) provide any information to any Person  (other than Buyer) in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal or (c) permit  an Acquired Company to

Closing, Seller shall make a capital contribution to the Acquired Company

Section  8.3 _Indemnification  Procedure_.

 

 

(a) Promptly  after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice by a third
party of a threatened  or filed complaint or the threatened or actual
commencement of any audit,  investigation, action or proceeding with respect
to which such Indemnified  Party  may be entitled to receive payment from
the other Party for any Loss, such  Indemnified Party shall provide written
notification to Buyer, on the one hand,  or the Seller, on the other hand,
whoever is the appropriate indemnifying Party  hereunder (the "
_Indemnifying  Party_ ")  within  five (5) Business Days of the Indemnified
Party's notice of threatening or  filing of such complaint or of the notice
of the threatened or actual  commencement of such audit, investigation,
action or proceeding; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the failure to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying  Party from
liability under this Agreement with respect to such claim only if,  and only
to the extent that, such failure to notify the Indemnifying Party  results in
(i) the forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses 
otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim or 
(ii)  prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. The
Indemnifying  Party shall have the right, upon written notice delivered to
the Indemnified  Party within sixty (60) days thereafter, to assume the
defense of such  complaint, audit, investigation, action or proceeding,
including the employment  of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party and the payment  of  the fees and disbursements of such
counsel. If the Indemnifying Party declines  or fails to assume the defense
of the audit, investigation, action or proceeding  on the terms provided
above within such sixty (60) day period, however, the  Indemnified Party may
employ counsel to represent or defend it in any such  audit, investigation,
action or proceeding and, if the Indemnifying Party agrees  that such audit,
investigation, action or proceeding is a matter with respect  to  which the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive payment from the Indemnifying  Party
for the Loss in question, the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable 
fees and disbursements of such counsel as incurred; _provided_ ,  _however_
,  that  the Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay the fees and
disbursements  of  more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction in any  single audit, investigation, action or proceeding. In
any audit, investigation,  action or proceeding with respect to which
indemnification is being sought  hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, whichever is not  assuming the defense of such action,
shall have the right to participate in  such  matter and to retain its own
counsel at such Party's own expense. The  Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall at all  times use reasonable
efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified  Party, as the case
may be, reasonably apprised of the status of any matter  the  defense of
which they are maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with each  other
with respect to the defense of any such matter.

 

 

(b) No  Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to
the entry  of  any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being
sought hereunder  without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party.

 

 

(c) If  an  Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant to this
Agreement not  involving a third party claim covered by Section 8.3(a)
hereof, such Indemnified  Party shall send written notice of such claim to
the appropriate Indemnifying  Party. Such notice shall specify the basis for
such claim. As promptly as  possible after the Indemnified Party has given
such notice (but in no event  more  than thirty (30) Business Days after
such notice has been given), such  Indemnified Party and the appropriate
Indemnifying Party shall establish the  merits and amount of such claim (by
mutual agreement, arbitration, litigation  or  otherwise) and, within five
(5) Business Days of the final determination of  the  merits and amount of
such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the  Indemnified Party
immediately available funds in an amount equal to such claim  as determined
hereunder, if any.

 

 

Section  8.4 _Claims  Period_.  The  Claims Period hereunder shall begin
on the date hereof and terminate as  follows:

 

 

(a) with  respect to Buyer Losses arising under (i) Section 8.1(a) with
respect to  any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in (A)
the first  sentence of Section 3.1, (B) Section 3.2, (C) Section 3.3(a) or
(D) Section  3.3(b) (the " _Fundamental  Representations_ "),  or  (ii)
Sections 8.1(b), 8.1(c) or 8.1(d), the  Claims Period shall  survive the
Closing until the expiration of the applicable statutes of  limitations;

 

 

(b) with  respect to Buyer Losses arising under Section 8.1(a), other than
with respect  to  any breach or inaccuracy of any of the Fundamental
Representations, the Claims  Period shall terminate on the date that is
eighteen (18) months following the  Closing Date;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-34-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) with  respect to Seller Losses arising under (i) Section 8.2(a) with
respect to  any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in (A)
Section 4.2  (Authorization), (B) Section 4.6 (Independent Review) or (C)
Section 4.7  (Certain Fees) or (ii) Sections 8.2(b) or 8.2(c), the Claims
Period  shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the applicable
statutes of  limitations; and

 

 

(d) with  respect to all other Seller Losses, the Claims Period Shall
terminate on the  date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing
Date.

 

 

No  claim  for indemnification can be made after the expiration of the
Claims Period;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  if  prior to the close of
business on the last day of the Claims Period, an  Indemnifying Party shall
have been properly notified of a claim for indemnity  hereunder and such
claim shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of  at  such date,
such claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for  indemnity
hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in  accordance
with the terms hereof.

 

 

Section  8.5 _Liability  Limits_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, Seller's  obligation to indemnify, defend and
hold the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless  shall be limited as follows:

 

 

(a) The  Buyer  Indemnified Parties shall not make a claim against Seller
for indemnification  under this Article VIII unless and until the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall  have suffered indemnifiable Losses in excess of
Fifteen Million Dollars  ($15,000,000) (the " _Buyer  Deductible_ ")  in
the  aggregate, in which case the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to  recover only Losses in excess of the Buyer Deductible; _provided_ , 
that no  Losses may be claimed by any Buyer Indemnified Party or shall be
reimbursable  by  or included in calculating the Buyer Deductible other than
Losses in excess  of  Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (the "
_Threshold  Amount_ ")  resulting from a single claim or aggregated claims
arising out of the same  facts, events or circumstances; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  any Losses arising under Section 8.1(a) with respect to
any breach or  inaccuracy of Section 3.6 shall not be subject to the
Threshold Amount but  shall  be subject to the Buyer Deductible;

 

 

(b) in  no  event shall the aggregate amount of indemnity required to be
paid by Seller  pursuant to this Article VIII exceed One Hundred Million
Dollars ($100,000,000)  (the " _Buyer  Cap_ ");

 

 

(c) for  purposes of computing the aggregate amount of claims against Seller,
the amount  of each claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be
an amount  equal  to, and any payments by Seller pursuant to this Article
VIII shall be limited  to, the amount of Losses that remain after deducting
therefrom (i) any third  party insurance proceeds and any indemnity,
contributions or other similar  payment payable by any third party with
respect thereto, but only to the extent  such proceeds, contributions or
payments are actually received by a Buyer  Indemnified Party, and (ii) any
net Tax benefit actually recognized by a Buyer  Indemnified Party or any
Affiliate thereof with respect to the Losses or items  giving rise to such
claim for indemnification, with such net Tax benefit (if  any) being
determined by properly taking into account any adverse Tax  consequences to a
Buyer Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof with respect  to the receipt
of such indemnification payments from Seller;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-35-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) in  any  claim for indemnification under this Agreement, Seller shall
not be required  to  indemnify any Person for special, exemplary or
consequential damages, including  loss of profit or revenue, any multiple of
reduced cash flow, interference  with  operations, or loss of tenants,
lenders, investors or buyers, other than  special, exemplary or consequential
damages actually paid to a Person other  than  a Buyer Indemnified Party;

 

 

(e) no  Indemnifying Party shall have any liability under this Article VIII
to  indemnify any Indemnified Party with respect to a Loss to the extent that
the  Loss arose from any action taken directly or indirectly by any
Indemnified  Party  on or after the Closing Date;

 

 

(f) no  Party  shall have any liability for any Loss which would not have
arisen but for any  alteration or repeal or enactment of any Law after the
Closing  Date;

 

 

(g) Seller  shall have no liability for any Loss that would not have arisen
but for any  change in the accounting policies, practices or procedures
adopted by Buyer  or  its Affiliates after the Closing Date, other than such
changes in accounting  policies to the extent but only to the extent the
Financial Statements are  not  in compliance with GAAP as in effect on the
date of the Financial  Statements;

 

 

(h) in  any  case where a Buyer Indemnified Party recovers from third
Persons any amount  in  respect of a matter with respect to which Seller has
indemnified it pursuant  to  this Agreement, such Buyer Indemnified Party
shall promptly pay over to Seller  the amount so recovered (after deducting
therefrom the full amount of the  expenses incurred by it in procuring such
recovery), but not in excess of the  sum of (i) any amount previously so paid
by Seller to or on behalf of the Buyer  Indemnified Party in respect of such
matter, and (ii) any reasonable amounts  expended by Seller in pursuing or
defending any third party claim arising out  of  such matter;

 

 

(i) the  liability of Seller for Buyer Losses shall be considered in the
aggregate and  shall be determined on a cumulative basis so the Buyer Losses
incurred under  Article VIII of this Agreement shall be combined with all
other Buyer  Losses incurred under Article VIII for purposes of determining
limitations  on  liability, including the maximum liability amounts
described above;  and

 

 

(j) any  indemnity payment under this Agreement by Seller shall be treated as
an  adjustment to the Purchase Price for U.S. federal Income Tax  purposes.

 

 

Notwithstanding  anything in this Article VIII to the contrary, in no event
shall the limitations  set forth in (x) Section 8.5(a) apply to any Buyer
Losses arising under Sections  8.1(b), 8.1(c), 8.1(d) or 8.1(a) with respect
to any breach or inaccuracy of  any  of the Fundamental Representations, (y)
Section 8.5(b) apply to any Buyer  Losses arising under Sections 8.1(c),
8.1(d), 8.1(a) with respect to any breach  or inaccuracy of any of the
Fundamental Representations or (z) Section 8.5(b)  apply to any Buyer Losses
arising under 8.1(b) with respect to any breach of  Sections 5.7(a) or 5.7(b)
(nor shall any such Buyer Losses count towards the  Buyer Cap).

Section  9.1 _Buyer 's  Access to Perform Environmental Site Assessments_.

 

 

(a) _Phase  I Environmental Site Assessment_.  To the  extent reasonably
possible during the Pre-Closing Period and subject to the  restrictions of
any applicable Law or contractual undertaking, Seller shall  afford to Buyer
and to its authorized Representatives, during reasonable  business hours,
reasonable access to the plants, properties (including site  visits),
personnel, officers, books and records, Environmental Permits and  other 
information of the Acquired Companies, including any and all Phase I 
Environmental Site Assessments commissioned by the Acquired Companies (if
any).  If any Phase I Environmental Site Assessment commissioned by the
Acquired  Companies is dated less than one (1) year prior to the date hereof,
Seller  shall  provide to Buyer documentation providing Buyer (in its
discretion) with the  ability to rely on those Phase I Environmental Site
Assessments commissioned  by  the Acquired Companies. At Buyer's sole
discretion, during the one-month period  following the Closing, Buyer may
commission one or more Phase I Environmental  Site Assessment(s) (a "
_Phase  I Environmental Site Assessment_ ")  in  accordance with ASTM E
1527-05 Standard Practice for Environmental Site  Assessments: Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment Process (" _Phase  I Standard_ ")  at the 
locations at which the Acquired Companies do business. Each such Phase I 
Environmental Site Assessment commissioned by Buyer shall be conducted at 
Buyer's cost. Promptly following the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide Seller
a  list of those sites at which it intends to conduct Phase I Environmental
Site  Assessments (the " _Designated  Locations_ ")  and  shall promptly
commission the identified Phase I Environmental Site Assessments  in
accordance with this Section 9.1(a).

 

 

(b) _Phase  II Environmental Site Assessment_.  During  the Environmental
Site Assessment Period, subject to Section 9.2(b), Buyer  may  perform one
or more Phase II Environmental Site Assessments in accordance with  ASTM E
1903-97 Standard Guide for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase II 
Environmental Site Assessment Process at one or more Designated Locations (a 
" _Phase  II Environmental Site Assessment_ ").  Each  such Phase II
Environmental Site Assessment commissioned by Buyer shall be  conducted at
Buyer's cost.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-37-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Article IX, Buyer and
any of its environmental  consultants and other representatives shall not,
during the Pre-Closing Period,  conduct Phase II Environmental Site
Assessments, monitoring or invasive sampling  of soil, groundwater, air, any
other environmental media, or building materials  or equipment, pertaining to
Environmental Laws or Hazardous Materials and  relating to the Owned Real
Property or the Leased Real Property, or directly  contact any relevant
environmental agency, in each case without the prior  written consent of
Seller.

 

 

Section  9.2 _Actions  Dependent Upon Findings From Phase I Environmental
Site  Assessments_.

 

 

(a) _Finding  of No Recognized Environmental Condition_.  If any  Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment performed or relied on pursuant to Section 
9.1(a) with respect to a Designated Location results in a finding that there 
are  no "recognized environmental conditions" (as that term is defined in the
Phase I  Standard) at that Designated Location, then Seller shall have no
obligation  to  pay Buyer any amounts pursuant to Section 9.4 with respect
to such Designated  Location.

 

 

(b) _Finding  of Recognized Environmental Condition_.  If any  Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment performed or relied on pursuant to Section 
9.1(a) with respect to a Designated Location results in a finding that there 
is  one or more "recognized environmental conditions" (as that term is
defined in  the Phase I Standard) at that Designated Location that did not
arise solely  from  off-site conditions or events, then Buyer shall (i)
provide Seller with a copy  of each such Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment commissioned by Buyer within  five (5) Business Days after Buyer's
receipt of each Phase I Environmental Site  Assessment and (ii) be entitled
to commission one or more Phase II Environmental  Site Assessments at that
Designated Location in accordance with  Section 9.1(b) above; _provided_ , 
_that_   (x) any  such Phase II Environmental Site Assessment shall be
conducted only with respect  to such "recognized environmental condition" and
(y) with respect to any "recognized environmental condition" identified in a
Phase I Environmental Site  Assessment referenced in the second sentence of
Section 9.1(a), where Buyer  intends to rely on such Phase I Environmental
Site Assessment rather than  commission its own, Buyer shall have notified
Seller in writing within thirty  (30) days following the Closing Date of
Buyer's intent to conduct a Phase II  Environmental Site Assessment. If Buyer
elects not to commission a Phase II  Environmental Site Assessment for a
Designated Location, then Seller shall  have  no obligation to pay Buyer
pursuant to Section 9.4 with respect to such  Designated Location. If Buyer
elects to commission a Phase II Environmental  Site  Assessment for a
Designated Location, then Buyer shall provide Seller with  notice of this
election within ten (10) Business Days after Buyer's receipt of  all of the
commissioned Phase I Environmental Site Assessments and shall  commission the
on-site work required for the Phase II Environmental Site  Assessment during
the one-month period after such an election; _provided_ ,  _that_   Seller 
shall have no obligation to pay any amount pursuant to Section 9.4 with
respect  to any Designated Location if all Phase II Environmental Site
Assessments with  respect to such Designated Location are not completed on or
before the day  that  is six (6) months following the Closing Date (the "
_Environmental  Site Assessment Period_ ").

Section  9.3 _Actions  Dependent Upon Findings From Phase II Environmental
Site  Assessments_.

 

 

(a) _No  Exceedance(s) of Clean Up Standards_.  If any  Phase II
Environmental Site Assessment at a Designated Location finds that  no 
concentrations of Hazardous Materials are determined to be present at, on, 
under  or around the location or locations of the "recognized environmental
condition" at that Designated Location (including, without limitation, the
soil,  groundwater, surface water, sediment or other media) that exceed
applicable  Clean Up Standards with respect to that Designated Location, then
Seller shall  have no obligation to pay Buyer pursuant to Section 9.4 with
respect to such  Designated Location.

 

 

(b) _Exceedance(s)  of Clean Up Standards_.  If any  Phase II Environmental
Site Assessment at the location or locations of the  "recognized
environmental condition" at a Designated Location finds that  concentrations
of Hazardous Materials are determined to be present at, on,  under  or
around the property at the location or locations of the "recognized 
environmental condition" on that Designated Location (including, without 
limitation, the soil, groundwater, surface water, sediment or other media) 
in  exceedance of applicable Clean Up Standards and do not clearly originate
from  an  off-site source, then (i) Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy
of such Phase  II Environmental Site Assessment within ten (10) Business Days
after Buyer's  receipt of the Phase II Environmental Site Assessment and (ii)
the Parties  shall  agree upon a remediation plan (or plans) as follows:

 

 

(i) Buyer  shall be entitled, at its cost, to commission a qualified
environmental  consultant, reasonably acceptable to Seller (" _Buyer 's 
Environmental Consultant_"),  to  prepare a remediation plan (or plans) to
address concentrations of Hazardous  Materials at, on, under or around the
location or locations of the "recognized  environmental condition" at the
Designated Location (including, without  limitation, the soil, groundwater,
surface water, sediment or other media)  in  exceedance of applicable Clean
Up Standards at the location or locations of  the "recognized environmental
condition" at that Designated Location that do not  clearly originate from an
off-site source (" _Buyer 's  Remediation Plan_").  Buyer's Remediation Plan
shall (A) be based on the most cost-effective means  reasonably available,
including, to the extent reasonable, the use of any  site-specific risk-based
standards, deed restrictions, land-use restrictions,  engineering controls,
natural attenuation, and monitoring activities, (B) meet  a  reasonable
standard allowed under Environmental Laws consistent with 
commercial/industrial use at the subject Designated Location compatible with 
current zoning at such Designated Location and (C) include, at a minimum, a 
summary of remedial action and cost estimate to address each location or 
locations of the "recognized environmental condition" where an exceedance of 
Clean Up Standards exists. Buyer shall submit Buyer's Remediation Plan,
together  with copies of all underlying or otherwise relevant Phase II
Environmental  Site  Assessments not provided to Seller previously, to
Seller for consideration  not  later than thirty (30) Business Days
following the completion of the Phase  II  Environmental Site Assessment.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-39-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) In  the  event Seller agrees with the cost and recommendations set
forth in Buyer's  Remediation Plan, such costs shall be treated as
Environmental Remediation  Costs.

 

 

(iii) In  the  event Seller does not agree with the costs and
recommendations set forth in  Buyer's Remediation Plan, Seller shall be
entitled, at its cost, to commission a  qualified environmental consultant,
reasonably acceptable to Buyer  (" _Seller 's  Environmental
Consultant_"),  to  prepare a remediation plan (or plans) to address
concentrations of Hazardous  Materials at, on, under or around the location
or locations of the "recognized  environmental condition" at the Designated
Location (including, without  limitation, the soil, groundwater, surface
water, sediment or other media)  in  exceedance of applicable Clean Up
Standards at the location or locations of  the "recognized environmental
condition" at the Designated Location that do not  clearly originate from an
off-site source (the " _Seller 's  Remediation Plan_").  Seller's
Remediation Plan shall (A) be based on the most cost-effective means 
reasonably available, including, to the extent reasonable, the use of any 
site-specific risk-based standards, deed restrictions, land-use
restrictions,  engineering controls, natural attenuation, and monitoring
activities, and (B)  meet a reasonable standard allowed under Environmental
Laws consistent with  commercial/industrial use at the subject Designated
Location compatible with  current zoning at such Designated Location. Seller
shall submit Seller's  Remediation Plan to Buyer for consideration not later
than thirty (30) Business  Days following Seller's receipt of Buyer's
Remediation Plan; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  such thirty (30)
Business Day period shall be extended by the amount of time,  if  any, by
which Buyer denies Seller reasonable access to the Real Property  pursuant to
Section 9.5(c).

 

 

(iv) In  the  event the estimated costs to remove and/or remediate such
Hazardous Materials  as  set forth in Buyer's Remediation Plan and Seller's
Remediation Plan do not  differ by more than 10% (as stated in Buyer's
Remediation Plan and Seller's  Remediation Plan), (A) the cost to remove
and/or remediate such Hazardous  Materials shall be deemed to equal the
average of the two estimated costs as  stated in Buyer's Remediation Plan and
Seller's Remediation Plan and (B) such  average estimated cost shall be
treated as an Environmental Remediation Cost  (as  defined below).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-40-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(v) In  the  event the estimated costs to remove and/or remediate such
Hazardous Materials  as  set forth in Buyer's Remediation Plan and Seller's
Remediation Plan differ by  more than 10% (as stated in Buyer's Remediation
Plan and Seller's Remediation  Plan), Buyer and Seller shall select a
mutually agreeable third qualified  environmental consultant (the " _Third 
Consultant_ "),  whose  costs shall be borne 50/50 by Buyer and Seller, to
prepare a remediation plan  (or plans) to address concentrations of Hazardous
Materials at, on, under or  around the location or locations of the
"recognized environmental condition" at  the Designated Location (including,
without limitation, the soil, groundwater,  surface water, sediment or other
media) in exceedance of applicable Clean Up  Standards at the location or
locations of the "recognized environmental  condition" at the Designated
Location that do not clearly originate from an  off-site source (the "
_Third  Remediation Plan_ ").  The  Third Remediation Plan shall (A) be
based on the most cost-effective means  reasonably available, including, to
the extent reasonable, the use of any  site-specific risk-based standards,
deed restrictions, land-use restrictions,  engineering controls, natural
attenuation, and monitoring activities, and (B)  meet a reasonable standard
allowed under Environmental Laws consistent with  commercial/industrial use
at the subject Designated Location compatible with  current zoning at such
Designated Location.

 

 

(vi) The  estimated cost to remove and/or remediate such Hazardous Materials
as set forth  in the Third Remediation Plan shall be deemed conclusive and
binding on both  parties (subject to the Environmental Basket and the
Environmental Cap (as  defined below)) and such cost shall be treated as an
Environmental Remediation  Cost (as defined below); _provided_ ,  _that_  
the cost  of removal and/or remediation as stated in the Third Remediation
Plan shall  not  be higher than the highest estimated cost nor lower than
the lowest estimated  cost as stated in Buyer's Remediation Plan or Seller's
Remediation Plan. 

 

 

(vii) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, except as provided in
Section 9.4, Seller  shall have no liability for (A) any Designated Location
referenced in Section  9.3(a), (B) any environmental condition or remediation
identified in any Phase  II Environmental Site Assessment completed after the
expiration of the  Environmental Site Assessment Period or (C) any
environmental condition or  remediation discovered or identified other than
pursuant to a Phase II  Environmental Site Assessment conducted pursuant to 
Section 9.2(b).

 

 

Section  9.4 _Payment  for Environmental Remediation Costs_.  Subject  to
the limitations set forth herein, with respect to each Designated Location, 
Seller shall pay promptly upon determination in accordance with Sections 9.1 
through 9.3 (but subject to the limitations therein) the amount determined 
to be  the estimated cost of remediation pursuant to Section 9.3(b) (the "
_Environmental  Remediation Costs_ ").  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller shall have no liability for any  Environmental Remediation Costs under
this Section 9.4 unless and until the  aggregate amount of all such
Environmental Remediation Costs exceeds Two Million  Dollars ($2,000,000)
(the " _Environmental  Basket_ "),  in  which event Seller shall only be
liable for all such Environmental Remediation  Costs in excess of the
Environmental Basket; _provided_ ,  that no  Environmental Remediation Costs
shall be due and payable by Seller, or shall  count toward satisfaction of
the Environmental Basket, with respect to an  individual "recognized
environmental condition" at a given Designated Location  with respect to
which the Environmental Remediation Costs relating to such  individual
"recognized environment condition" is less than Two Hundred Fifty  Thousand
Dollars ($250,000). The total aggregate amount of the liability of  Seller
for all Environmental Remediation Costs shall be limited to Thirty  Million
Dollars ($30,000,000) (the " _Environmental  Cap_ ").

Section  9.5 _Obligations  of Buyer and Seller_.

 

 

(a) During  the period prior to Closing, Buyer shall use its reasonable good
faith efforts  to apprise Seller of any "recognized environmental conditions"
(as that term is  defined in the Phase I Standard) or concentrations of
Hazardous Materials at,  on, under or around that particular property or
location (including, without  limitation, the soil, groundwater, surface
water, sediment or other media)  in  exceedance of applicable Clean Up
Standards of which Buyer becomes  aware.

 

 

(b) The  provisions of this Article IX set forth the exclusive rights and
remedies of  Buyer to seek or obtain damages or any other remedy or relief
whatsoever from  Seller with respect to Environmental Remediation Costs or
any environmental  condition with respect to any Real Property or any
violation by any Acquired  Company of any Environmental Laws, or the storage,
handling, disposal or Release  of any Hazardous Material.

 

 

(c) Subject  to the restrictions of any applicable Law or contractual
undertaking, until  the  payment by or resolution with respect to all
Environmental Remediation Costs  pursuant to this Article IX, Buyer shall
provide Seller and its authorized  representatives reasonable access to the
Real Property as may be reasonably  requested by Seller to verify the
information contained in the Phase I  Environmental Site Assessments and
Phase II Environmental Site Assessments  provided by Buyer to Seller;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  any such access shall be provided during
normal business hours under the  supervision of Buyer's personnel and in such
a manner as to not interfere  unreasonably with the business operations of
Buyer or the Acquired  Companies.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Article IX, in no event
shall Seller be  required to pay any amounts related to any "recognized
environmental condition" that (i) occurs after the Closing Date, or (ii)
exists prior to the Closing  Date, but, in the case of this clause (ii), only
to the extent such condition  (A) is made materially worse  by any  action
knowingly taken by Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing  (other
than Phase I or II environmental testing pursuant to this Article IX 
conducted in accordance with customary environmental testing standards), or 
(B)  is made materially worse by any knowing failure of Buyer or any of its 
Affiliates to take an action after the Closing that is required under 
Environmental Laws or an applicable Environmental Permit or by a
Governmental  Entity.

Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and  effect so long as the

permitted assigns, with respect to the obligations of Buyer  under  this
Agreement, and (b) for the benefit of Buyer, and its respective successors 
and permitted assigns, with respect to the obligations of Seller, under this 
Agreement, and this Agreement shall not be deemed to confer upon or give to 
any  other third party any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of
action  or other right.

 

 

Section  10.6 _Section  Headings_.  The  Article and Section headings
contained in this Agreement are exclusively for  the  purpose of reference,
are not part of the agreement of the Parties and shall  not  in any way
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

 

Section  10.7 _Dispute  Resolution_.  Except  with respect to disputes
related to a breach or threatened breach of  Sections 5.11 or 5.12, which
such disputes Buyer shall be entitled to  submit to an appropriate court
pursuant to Section 10.10 without following  the  procedures prescribed in
this Section 10.7, in the event a dispute arises under  or pursuant to this
Agreement, Buyer and Seller agree to attempt to resolve  such  dispute via
good faith discussions between each of their respective senior  management
teams for a period of ten (10) days following distribution of notice  from
Buyer or Seller, as applicable, of such dispute. Should such discussions 
fail to resolve the dispute, the respective Chief Executive Officers of
Buyer  and Seller shall then speak directly in an attempt to resolve such
issues for  a  period of two (2) days. If, after good faith discussions for
two (2) days the  respective Chief Executive Officers of Buyer and Seller are
unable to reach an  agreement with respect to such issues, either Buyer or
Seller may file suit  as  provided in Section 10.10.

 

 

Section  10.8 _Entire  Agreement_.  This  Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the other documents delivered  pursuant to this Agreement

subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all other  prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties  with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement.

 

 

Section  10.9 _Governing  Law_.  This  Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of  the  State of Delaware (regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under  applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof) as to all matters, including  matters of validity,
construction, effect, performance and  remedies.

 

 

Section  10.10 _Consent  to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_.  The 
Parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the
State  of Delaware or the courts of the United States located in Wilmington,
Delaware  in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions
of this  Agreement and any related agreement, certificate or other document
delivered  in  connection herewith and by this Agreement waive, and agree
not to assert, any  defense in any action for the interpretation or
enforcement of this Agreement  and any related agreement, certificate or
other document delivered in connection  herewith, that they are not subject
thereto or that such action may not be  brought or is not maintainable in
such courts or that this Agreement may not  be  enforced in or by such
courts or that their property is exempt or immune from  execution, that the
action is brought in an inconvenient forum, or that the  venue of the action
is improper. Service of process with respect thereto may  be  made upon
either Party by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified  mail,
postage prepaid, to such party at its address as provided in Section  10.2.

Section  10.11 _Waiver  of Jury Trial_.  Each  Party hereby acknowledges
and agrees that any controversy which may arise under  this Agreement is
likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and  therefore each such
Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any  right such Party may
have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation  directly or indirectly
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party certifies and  acknowledges that
(a) no representative, agent or attorney of the other Party  has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in  the  event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) each Party  understands
and has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) each Party  makes
this waiver voluntarily, and (d) each Party has been induced to enter  into 
this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications 
in  this Section 10.11.

 

 

Section  10.12 _Specific  Performance_.  The  Parties acknowledge and
agree that any breach of the terms of this Agreement  would give rise to
irreparable harm for which money damages would not be an  adequate remedy and
accordingly the Parties agree that, in addition to any  other  remedies,
each Party shall be entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement  by  a
decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy  of money damages as a remedy.

 

 

Section  10.13 _Counterparts_.  This  Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to  be  an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement.  Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by  facsimile shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart  of the Agreement.

 

 

Section  10.14 _Amendment;  Modification_.  This  Agreement may be
amended, modified or supplemented at any time only by written  agreement of
the Parties.

 

 

Section  10.15 _Guarantee_.

 

 

(a) Seller  Guarantor and Buyer Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantee  all obligations of Seller and Buyer, (and in the case
of Seller, any Transferee)  respectively, under this Agreement, including,
but not limited to, payment  obligations. This guarantee is a guaranty of
payment and not of collection  only.  Neither Seller nor Buyer shall be
required to exhaust any right or remedy or  to  take any action against any
other Person or any collateral in order to receive  payment from Buyer
Guarantor or Seller Guarantor, as applicable. The liability  of Seller
Guarantor and Buyer Guarantor under this Section 10.15(a) is  absolute and
unconditional irrespective of: (i) any change in the time,  manner or place
of payment of, or in any other term of, this Agreement or any  amendment of
this Agreement, or any waiver of or any consent to departure from  any of the
terms of this Agreement; and (ii) any other defense, setoff or  counterclaim
whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated
hereby that might constitute a defense available to, or discharge  of, Seller
or Seller Guarantor, in the case of Buyer, and Buyer or Buyer  Guarantor, in
the case of Seller.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-46-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Each  of  Buyer Guarantor and Seller Guarantor hereby acknowledge and
agree to be bound  by  Sections 10.10 and 10.11 of this Agreement.
