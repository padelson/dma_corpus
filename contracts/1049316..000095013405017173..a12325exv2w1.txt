of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "REIT Merger") on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with Title 8 of the
Corporations and Associations Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, as
amended (the "Maryland REIT Law");

     WHEREAS, the parties also wish to effect a merger of the Merger Partnership
with and into the Partnership, immediately following the consummation of the

"Mergers"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with Section 17-211 of the Delaware Revised Uniform
Limited Partnership Act, as amended ("DRULPA");

     WHEREAS, the Company is the sole general partner of the Partnership through

     all cases, the right to receive the Company Common Share Merger
     Consideration, without interest.

          (e) Preferred Shares.

               (i) The REIT Merger shall have no effect on the Company's 7.5%

          immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time and, at and after
          the REIT Merger Effective Time, the Company Series B Preferred Shares
          shall remain outstanding and shall continue to represent Company
          Series B Preferred Shares of the Surviving REIT.

     The Company Common Shares, Company Series A Preferred Shares and Company
Series B Preferred Shares shall be sometimes collectively referred to herein as
the "Company Shares."

          (f) Company Share Options. Immediately prior to the REIT Merger
     Effective Time, each outstanding qualified or nonqualified option to
     purchase Company Common Shares (each, a "Company Share Option") under the
     Company's Second Amended and Restated 1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the
     "Company Share Option Plan"), all of which are listed on Schedule 3.2(c) of
     the Company Disclosure Schedule attached hereto, whether or not then vested
     or exercisable and regardless of the exercise price or purchase price, as
     the case may be, thereof, shall be cancelled, immediately prior to or at
     the REIT Merger Effective Time, in exchange for the holder's right to
     receive a single lump sum cash payment from the Company equal to the
     product of (x) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company
     Share Option immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, whether
     or not vested or exercisable, and (y) the excess, if any, of the Company
     Common Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price or purchase price
     per share of such Company Share Option (the "Option Merger Consideration").
     If the exercise price or purchase price per share of any such Company


                                        5
<PAGE>
     Share Option is equal to or greater than the Company Common Share Merger
     Consideration, such Company Share Option shall be cancelled without any
     cash payment being made in respect thereof. The Company Common Share Merger
     Consideration and the Option Merger Consideration shall be collectively
     referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration."

          (g) Restricted Shares, Phantom Shares, Deferred Restricted Shares and
     Deferred Fee Accounts. Immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time,
     each restricted share granted under the Company Share Option Plan
     ("Restricted Shares"), phantom share ("Phantom Shares") issued pursuant to
     the Company's Phantom Share Purchase Program (the "Phantom Plan"),
     Restricted Shares deferred under a Restricted Share Deferral Agreement
     ("Deferred Restricted Shares") and phantom shares ("Fee Shares") under the
     Company's Deferred Compensation and Stock Plan for Trustees (the "Trustees
     Deferred Compensation Plan") shall be fully vested, non-forfeitable and
     payable to each participant in full, and all Company Common Shares which
     the Company has the option of issuing in settlement of the Phantom Shares
     or the Fee Shares shall be considered outstanding for all purposes of this
     Agreement, including receipt of the Merger Consideration.

     2.2 Effect on Partnership Interests. As of the Partnership Merger Effective
Time, by virtue of the Partnership Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder of any partnership interest of the Partnership:

          (a) Each Partnership Common Unit held by a Minority Limited Partner
     (the "LP Minority Units"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth
     herein, shall be converted into, and shall be cancelled in exchange for,
     the right to receive cash in an amount without interest per LP Minority
     Unit equal to the product of (A) the Company Common Share Merger
     Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of Company Common Shares
     issuable upon redemption of each such LP Minority Unit pursuant to the
     limited partnership agreement of the Partnership (such product, the
     "Partnership Merger Consideration") in consideration for each such LP
     Minority Unit; provided that if any Minority Limited Partner has previously
     made an election to receive OP LP LLC Membership Interests pursuant to the
     Form of Membership Interest Election (in the form attached hereto as
     Exhibit A), in lieu of receiving the Partnership Merger Consideration, such
     holder shall exchange each LP Minority Unit held by it for OP LP LLC
     Membership Interests, in accordance with the procedures and time periods
     specified in Section 2.3 hereof and upon such terms as are described in the
     term sheet attached hereto as Schedule 2.2(a) (the "Membership Interest
     Election").

          (b) Each Partnership Common Unit held by the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time
     shall, by virtue of the Partnership Merger, automatically be cancelled and
     cease to exist, and the holders thereof shall cease to have any rights with
     respect thereto and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

          (c) Each Partnership Preferred Unit outstanding immediately prior to
     the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall be unaffected by the
     Partnership Merger and shall remain outstanding as units of limited
     partnership interest of the Surviving Partnership.


                                        6
<PAGE>
          (d) The general partner interests of the Partnership outstanding
     immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall remain
     outstanding as general partner interests of the Surviving Partnership,
     entitling the holder thereof to such rights, duties and obligations as are
     more fully set forth in the Surviving Partnership Agreement.

     2.3 Exchange of Certificates

          (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement (as
     defined herein), Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
     satisfactory to the Company to act as Paying Agent (the "Paying Agent") for
     (i) the payment or exchange in accordance with this Article II of the
     Company Common Share Merger Consideration and the Partnership Merger
     Consideration (such cash consideration constituting both the Company Common
     Share Merger Consideration and the Partnership Merger Consideration being
     referred to herein as the "Exchange Fund") and (ii), if Parent wishes the
     Paying Agent to so act, in Parent's discretion, the exchange of Partnership
     Common Units for OP LP LLC Membership Interests in accordance with this
     Article II pursuant to the Membership Interest Election. On or before the
     REIT Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent the
     Exchange Fund for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Shares and
     Cash-Out Limited Partners, as applicable. The Paying Agent shall make
     payments of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration and the
     Partnership Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance
     with this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the Partnership Merger
     Certificate. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and any title company
     escrow agent to facilitate an orderly transfer of funds. The Exchange Fund
     shall not be used for any other purpose. Any and all interest earned on
     cash deposited in the Exchange Fund shall be paid to the Surviving REIT.

          (b) Share and Unit Transfer Books. On the Closing Date, the share
     transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be
     no further registration of transfers of the Company Common Shares or
     Partnership Common Units. From and after the Closing Date, the holders of
     certificates evidencing ownership of the Company Common Shares or
     Partnership Common Units outstanding immediately prior to the REIT Merger
     Effective Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable (each, a
     "Certificate") shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares or
     units, as applicable, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after
     the Closing Date, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent, the
     Surviving REIT or the transfer agent for any reason shall be exchanged for
     the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Partnership Merger
     Consideration or OP LP LLC Membership Interests, as applicable, with
     respect to the Company Common Shares or Partnership Common Units formerly
     represented thereby.

          (c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as possible after the Closing Date
     (but in any event within three (3) Business Days), the Surviving REIT shall
     cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
     Certificates that, immediately


                                        7
<PAGE>
     prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, represented outstanding Company
     Common Shares or that, immediately prior to the Partnership Merger
     Effective Time, represented Partnership Common Units whose shares or units,
     as applicable, were converted into the right to receive or be exchanged for
     the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Partnership Merger
     Consideration or OP LP LLC Membership Interests, as applicable, pursuant to
     Sections 2.1 and 2.2: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
     delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
     shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
     the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such
     other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii)
     instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
     exchange for the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Partnership
     Merger Consideration or OP LP LLC Membership Interests, as applicable, to
     which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
     cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents
     reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by Parent,
     together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
     accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
     reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
     shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Company Common Share
     Merger Consideration, Partnership Merger Consideration or OP LP LLC
     Membership Interests, as applicable, payable in respect of the Company
     Common Shares or Partnership Common Units, as applicable, previously
     represented by such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article
     II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the
     event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares or Partnership
     Common Units that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company
     or Partnership, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in
     whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
     Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
     transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
     other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
     registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
     satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
     Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate
     shall be deemed at any time after the Closing Date to represent only the
     right to receive, upon such surrender, the Company Common Share Merger
     Consideration, Partnership Merger Consideration or OP LP LLC Membership
     Interests, as applicable, as contemplated by this Section 2.3. No interest
     shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any
     Certificate.

          (d) No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Common Shares, Company
     Share Options or Partnership Common Units. On the Closing Date, holders of
     Company Common Shares or Partnership Common Units shall cease to be, and
     shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company or limited partners of
     the Partnership other than the right to receive the Company Common Share
     Merger Consideration, Partnership Merger Consideration or OP LP LLC
     Membership Interests, as applicable, provided under this Article II. The
     Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Partnership Merger Consideration
     or OP LP LLC Membership Interests, as applicable, paid or delivered upon
     the surrender for exchange of Certificates evidencing Company Common Shares
     or Partnership Common Units, in accordance with the terms of this Article
     II shall be deemed to have been paid or delivered, as the case may be, in
     full satisfaction of all rights


                                        8
<PAGE>
     and privileges pertaining to the Company Common Shares or Partnership
     Common Units, exchanged therefor. The Option Merger Consideration paid with
     respect to Company Share Options in accordance with the terms of this
     Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
     rights and privileges pertaining to the canceled Company Share Options and
     on and after the REIT Merger Effective Time the holders of a Company Share
     Option shall have no further rights with respect to any Company Share
     Option, other than the right to receive the Option Merger Consideration as
     provided in Section 2.1 (f).

          (e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
     which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve
     (12) months after the Closing Date, shall be delivered to Surviving REIT
     and any holders of Company Common Shares or Partnership Common Units prior
     to the REIT Merger or Partnership Merger, as applicable, who have not
     theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the
     Surviving REIT and only as general creditors thereof for payment of the
     Company Common Share Merger Consideration or Partnership Merger
     Consideration, as applicable.

          (f) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving REIT, the
     Partnership, Merger Partnership, Surviving Partnership, the Company or the
     Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, trustee, director, agent or
     Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of Company
     Common Share Merger Consideration or Partnership Merger Consideration, as
     applicable, from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant
     to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

          (g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any
     cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving REIT, on a
     daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
     shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that there are losses with respect
     to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons
     below the level required to make prompt payments of the Company Common
     Share Merger Consideration and Partnership Merger Consideration as
     contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion
     of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to
     ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level
     sufficient to make such payments.

          (h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
     or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
     claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting
     of a bond to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent,
     the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
     Certificate, the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Partnership
     Merger Consideration or OP LP LLC Membership Interests, as applicable,
     payable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

     2.4 Withholding Rights. The Surviving REIT, Surviving Partnership or the
Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Common Shares, Company Share Options or to any holders of Partnership
Common Units such amounts as it is required to deduct


                                        9
<PAGE>
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code (as
defined herein), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving REIT, Surviving Partnership or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Shares,
Partnership Common Units or Company Share Options in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving REIT, Surviving Partnership
or the Paying Agent, as applicable.

     2.5 Dissenters' Rights. No dissenters' or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Mergers.

     2.6 Adjustment of Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Partnership
Merger Consideration or OP LP LLC Membership Interests. In the event that,
subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the REIT Merger Effective
Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, the Company Common
Shares or Partnership Common Units issued and outstanding shall, through a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split,
reverse stock split or other similar change in the capitalization of the Company
or Partnership, as applicable, increase or decrease in number or be changed into
or exchanged for a different kind or number of securities, then an appropriate
and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration, Partnership Merger Consideration or OP LP LLC Membership
Interests, provided, however, that nothing set forth in this Section 2.6 shall
be construed to supersede or in any way limit the prohibitions set forth in
Section 5.1 hereof.

     to do business and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in

     remediation, abatement and/or mitigation) have been and are being
     performed, paid or taken, as the case may be, in accordance with said
     application, submission or agreement and with applicable Laws, other than
     those where, individually or in the aggregate, the failure does not have
     and would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (h) Section 3.11(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
     correct and complete list of each ground lease pursuant to which the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a lessee (individually, "Ground
     Lease" and collectively, "Ground Leases"). Each Ground Lease is in full
     force and effect and is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with
     its terms against (a) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (b) to
     the knowledge of the Company, the other parties thereto, except as do not
     have and would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the
     aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Except as listed in Section 3.11(h)
     of the Company Disclosure Schedule or which do not have and would not
     reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
     Adverse Effect, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have performed all
     obligations required to be performed by it to date under each of the Ground
     Leases and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the
     knowledge of the Company, any other party, is in default under any Ground
     Lease, which default has or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
     Adverse Effect (and to the Company's knowledge, no event has occurred
     which, with due notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a
     default). The Company has made available to Parent a correct and complete
     copy of each Ground Lease and all amendments thereto.

     Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any
     unexpired option agreements or rights of first refusal with respect to the
     purchase of a Company Property or any portion thereof or any other
     unexpired rights in favor of any Third Party to purchase or otherwise
     acquire a Company Property or any portion thereof or entered into any

     any Third Party, pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
     is currently entitled to receive in excess of $250,000 (the "Reimbursement
     Agreements").

          (l) Except for the applicable tenant's management obligations as set
     forth in the Company Leases, neither the Company nor any of its
     Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement relating to the management of any
     of the Company Properties by a party other than the Company or any
     wholly-owned Company Subsidiaries (a "Third Party").

          (m) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(m) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
     agreement pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries manages
     any real properties for any Third Party.

          (n) Except for those contracts or agreements set forth in Section
     3.11(n) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of
     its Subsidiaries has entered into any contract or agreement (collectively,
     the "Participation Agreements") with any Third Party or any employee,
     consultant, Affiliate or other person (the "Participation Party") which
     provides for a right of such Participation Party to participate, invest,
     join, partner, have any interest in whatsoever (whether characterized as a
     contingent fee, profits interest, equity interest or otherwise) or have the
     right to any of the foregoing in any proposed or anticipated investment
     opportunity, joint venture, partnership or any other current or future
     transaction or property in which the Company or any Subsidiary has or will
     have an interest, including but not limited to those transactions or
     properties identified, sourced, produced or developed by such Participation
     Party (a "Participation Interest"). Section 3.11(n) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule sets forth the only transactions or Company Properties
     for which any Participation Party currently has a Participation Interest
     pursuant to such Participation Agreements.

          (o) Section 3.11(o) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a

     employed by the Company or the Partnership. Section 3.12(a) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all "employee benefit plans," as
     defined in Section 3(3) of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of
     1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and all other material employee benefit plans
     or other benefit arrangements or payroll practices including bonus plans,
     fringe benefits, executive compensation, consulting or other compensation
     agreements, change in control agreements, incentive, equity or equity-based
     compensation, deferred compensation arrangements, stock purchase, severance
     pay, sick leave, vacation pay, salary continuation, hospitalization,
     medical benefits, life insurance, other welfare benefits, scholarship
     programs, directors' benefit, bonus or other incentive compensation, which
     the Company or the Partnership sponsors, maintains, contributes to or has
     any obligation to contribute to (each a "Company Employee Benefit Plan" and
     collectively, the "Company Employee Benefit Plans"). None of the Company
     Employee Benefit Plans is or has been subject to Title IV of ERISA, or is
     or has been subject to Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA, nor is the Company,
     its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate obligated to contribute to a
     multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer
     Plan"). Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any
     material present or contingent liability under Title IV of ERISA, nor does
     any condition exist which could reasonably be likely to result in any such
     liability.

          (b) Correct and complete copies of the following documents, with
     respect to each of the Company Employee Benefit Plans, other than a
     Multiemployer Plan, have been made available to Parent by the Company: (i)
     plan and related trust documents, and amendments thereto; (ii) the three
     most recent Forms 5500 and schedules thereto, if applicable; (iii) the most
     recent Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") opinion letter or determination
     letter (which resulted from a proper and timely filing with the IRS), if
     any; (iv) the three most recent financial statements and actuarial
     valuations, if applicable; and (v) summary plan descriptions, if
     applicable.

          (c) Except as would not have and would not reasonably be likely to
     have, a Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company and the Partnership have
     performed all obligations required to be performed by them under all
     Company Employee Benefit Plans; (ii) the Company Employee Benefit Plans
     have been administered in compliance with their terms and the requirements
     of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws; (iii) all contributions
     (including all employer contributions and employee salary reduction
     contributions) required to have been made under any of the Company Employee
     Benefit Plans to any funds or trusts established thereunder or in
     connection therewith have been made by the due date thereof and all
     contributions for any period ending on or before the Closing Date which are
     not yet due will have been paid or accrued prior to the Closing


                                       23
<PAGE>
     Date; (iv) there are no actions, suits, arbitrations, investigations,
     audits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits) filed, or to the
     knowledge of the Company or the Partnership, threatened in writing with
     respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan; and (v) the Company and the
     Partnership have no liability as a result of any "prohibited transaction"
     (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) for any
     excise Tax or civil penalty.

          (d) Neither the Company nor the Partnership is subject to any
     unsatisfied withdrawal liability with respect to any Multiemployer Plan.

          (e) Each of the Company Employee Benefit Plans which is intended to be
     "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received
     an opinion letter or determination letter from the IRS. The Company and the
     Partnership know of no fact which would adversely affect the qualified
     status of any such Company Employee Benefit Plan or the exemption of such
     trust.

          (f) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(f) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule, none of the Employee Benefit Plans provide for continuing
     post-employment health, life insurance coverage or other welfare benefits
     for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant except as may be
     required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985,
     as amended, or similar state law ("COBRA").

          (g) No stock or other security issued by the Company forms or has
     formed a material part of the assets of any tax qualified Company Employee
     Benefit Plan.

          (h) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(h) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
     consummation of the Mergers will (i) result in any material payment
     becoming due, or materially increase the amount of compensation due, to any
     current or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii)
     materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company
     Employee Benefit Plan; or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of
     payment or vesting of any such material benefits.

     its Subsidiaries.

          (d) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(d) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule, there are no complaints, charges or claims against the Company or
     any of its Subsidiaries filed or, to the knowledge of the Company,

     Schedule, (i) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance in

     3.15 Tax Matters.

          (a) All federal and all other material Tax Returns (as hereinafter
     defined) required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries have been filed with the appropriate taxing authorities in all
     jurisdictions in which such Tax Returns are required to be filed (after
     giving effect to any valid extensions of time in which to make such
     filings), and all such Tax Returns, as amended, were accurate and complete
     in all material respects. Except as and to the extent publicly disclosed by
     the Company in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this
     Agreement, (i) all Taxes payable


                                       27
<PAGE>
     by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not
     shown in a Tax Return) have been fully and timely paid or adequately
     provided for in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) adequate reserves or
     accruals for Taxes have been provided in accordance with GAAP with respect
     to any period for which Tax Returns have not yet been filed or for which
     Taxes are not yet due and owing or for which Taxes are being contested in
     good faith. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has executed or
     filed with the IRS or any other taxing authority any agreement, waiver or
     other document or arrangement extending or having the effect of extending
     the period for assessment or collection of Taxes (including, but not

     with respect to any Tax matter is currently in force, except in connection
     with the appeals of local tax assessments described in Section 3.15(a) of
     the Company Disclosure Schedule.

          (b) The Company (i) for all taxable years commencing in 1998, the year
     in which the Company first made a REIT tax election, through the most
     recent December 31, has been subject to taxation as a real estate
     investment trust (a "REIT") within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code
     and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years,
     (ii) has operated, and intends to continue to operate, in such a manner as
     to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year including the date the REIT
     Merger becomes effective and (iii) has not taken or omitted to take any
     action which would reasonably be likely to result in a challenge to its
     status as a REIT, and, to the Company's knowledge, no challenge to the
     Company's status as a REIT is pending or threatened in writing. Each
     Subsidiary of the Company that is a partnership, joint venture, or limited
     liability company (i) has been since its formation and continues to be
     treated for federal income tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded
     entity, as the case may be, and not as a corporation or an association
     taxable as a corporation and (ii) has not since the later of its formation
     or the acquisition by the Company of a direct or indirect interest therein,
     owned any assets (including, without limitation, securities) that would
     cause the Company to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. Each Subsidiary
     of the Company that is a corporation has been since the later of the date
     of its formation or the date on which such Subsidiary became a Subsidiary
     of the Company a "qualified REIT subsidiary" pursuant to Section 856(i) of
     the Code or a "taxable REIT subsidiary" pursuant to Section 856(l) of the
     Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries holds any asset (i)
     the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374
     of the Code, whether or not as a result of (A) an election under IRS Notice
     88-19 or Treasury regulations Section 1.337(d)-5T or Section 1.337(d)-6 or
     (B) the application of Treasury regulations Section 1.337(d)-7, or (ii)
     which is subject to a consent filed pursuant to section 341(f) of the Code
     and the regulations thereunder.

          (c) Since January 1, 2000, the Company has incurred no liability for
     excise taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, including
     without limitation any excise tax arising from a prohibited transaction
     described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code or any tax arising from
     "redetermined rents, redetermined deductions and excess interest" described
     in Section 857(b)(7) of the Code, and neither the Company nor any of its
     Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in
     the usual, regular and ordinary course of business. No event has occurred
     and no condition or circumstance exists which presents a material risk that
     any material Tax described in the preceding sentence will be imposed upon
     the Company or its Subsidiaries.


                                       28
<PAGE>
          (d) There are no material deficiencies asserted or assessments made as
     a result of any examinations by the IRS or any other taxing authority of
     the Tax Returns of or covering or including the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no other
     audits relating to any material Taxes by any taxing authority in progress,
     nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries received any written notice
     from any taxing authority that it intends to conduct such an audit.

          (e) The Company and its Subsidiaries (i) have complied in all material
     respects with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations relating to the
     payment and withholding of Taxes; (ii) have duly and timely withheld from
     employee salaries, wages and other compensation and have paid over to the

     3.16 Material Contracts.

          (a) Section 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a

     appropriate); (v) agreements that purport to limit, curtail or restrict the
     ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any

     by the Company in the usual, regular and ordinary course of business
     consistent with past practice contained in the Company Leases and in other

     contract (including, without limitation, any brokerage agreements) entered
     into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which may result in total
     payments by or liability of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company in
     excess of $100,000 annually, other than any Company Leases and any
     documents relating to the indebtedness described in Section 3.15(a)(iv);


                                       31
<PAGE>
     provided, however, any contract under clause (viii) above that, by its
     terms, is terminable within thirty (30) days (without termination fee or
     penalty) of the date of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a Company
     Material Contract; (ix) the material contracts included in Section 3.11 of
     the Company Disclosure Schedule; and (x) contracts and agreements to enter
     into any of the foregoing. Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule lists, as of June 30, 2005, the outstanding principal balance,
     maturity date and applicable interest rate (including the method or formula
     for calculating any interest that is not a fixed percentage of the
     principal balance) for the indebtedness evidenced by each loan listed on
     the Company Disclosure Schedule pursuant to Section 3.16(a)(iv) hereof.

          (b) Each of the Company Material Contracts is in full force and effect
     and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the Company or
     its Subsidiaries, enforceable against the Company or its Subsidiaries, as
     the case may be, and, to the knowledge of the Company, the other parties
     thereto, in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be
     limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
     and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
     creditors' rights or by general equity principles). To the Company's
     knowledge, there is no default (nor does there exist any condition which
     upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would cause such a
     violation or default) under any Company Material Contract so listed by the
     Company as has or would reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse
     Effect.

          (c) To the Company's knowledge, the Company Material Contacts in which
     the Company is the lender or mortgagee (the "Lending Contracts") are listed
     in Section 3.16(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Lending
     Contracts are enforceable against the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the
     case may be, and, to the knowledge of the Company, the other parties
     thereto, in accordance with their terms (except as enforceability may be
     limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
     and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
     creditors' rights or by general equity principles), and the security
     interests and liens purported to be executed in favor of the Company
     thereby are, to the Company's knowledge, valid, perfected and first
     priority security interests and liens.

          (d) To the extent not set forth in response to the requirements of
     Section 3.16(a) hereof, Section 3.16(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
     sets forth each interest rate cap, interest rate collar, interest rate
     swap, currency hedging transaction, and any other agreement relating to a
     similar transaction to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
     party or an obligor with respect thereto.

          (e) Except as set forth in Section 3.16(e) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) any
     continuing material contractual liability for indemnification or otherwise
     under any agreement relating to the sale of real estate previously owned,
     whether directly or indirectly, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
     except for standard indemnification provisions entered into in the normal
     course of business, (ii) any continuing liability to make any material
     reprorations or adjustments to prorations that may previously have been
     made with respect to any property currently or formerly owned by the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) any continuing material
     contractual liability to pay any additional purchase price for any of the
     Company Properties.

copy of such opinion shall be delivered to Parent promptly after the date

     3.18 Brokers. The Company has not entered into any contract, arrangement or
understanding with any Person or firm which may result in the obligation of the
Company, Parent, Partnership, Merger Sub or Merger Partnership to pay any
finder's fees, brokerage or agent's commissions or other like payments in
connection with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or consummation of
the Mergers, except that the Company has retained Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC
as financial advisor to the Special Committee of the Company Board in connection
with the Mergers. The Company has furnished to Parent a true, complete and
correct copy of all agreements between the Company and Wachovia Capital Markets,
LLC relating to the Mergers, which agreements disclose all fees payable by the
Company or any of its Affiliates to Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC.

     3.19 Takeover Statutes. The Company has taken all action required to be
taken by it in order to exempt this Agreement and the Mergers from, and this
Agreement and the Mergers are exempt from, the requirements of any "moratorium,"
"control share," "fair price," "affiliate transaction," "business combination"
or other takeover Laws and regulations of the Maryland Business Combination Act
and Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act or any takeover provision in the
Company Declaration of Trust, Company Bylaws or other organizational document to
which the Company is a party (collectively, "Takeover Statutes").

     3.20 Related Party Transactions. Except as set forth and identified as
Related Party Transactions in Section 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
or as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this
Agreement and except for usual, regular and ordinary course advances to
employees, set forth in Section 3.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule is a
list of all agreements and contracts entered into by the Company or any of the
Company's Subsidiaries under which continuing obligations exist with any Person
who is an officer, trustee or Affiliate (as defined below) of the Company or any
of the Company's Subsidiaries, any member of the "immediate family" (as such
term is defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities
Act) of any of the foregoing or any entity of which any of the foregoing is an
Affiliate. As used in this Agreement, the term "Affiliate" shall have the same
meaning as such term is defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities
Act.

     3.21 Investment Company Act of 1940. Neither the Company nor any of the
Company's Subsidiaries are, or at the Closing Date will be, required to be

<PAGE>
of any trademarks or patents other than licenses, contracts or agreements
arising from the purchase of "off the shelf" products. The intellectual property
that the Company and its Subsidiaries own, license or otherwise possess legally
enforceable rights to use constitutes all of the intellectual property necessary
to carry on the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted, except where the failure to own, be so licensed or otherwise possess
such intellectual property does not and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. The Company intellectual property is valid and has
not been cancelled, forfeited, expired or abandoned, and neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has received any written, or to the Company's knowledge,
non-written, notice challenging the validity or enforceability of Company
intellectual property, other than as does not and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the Company's knowledge, the
conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries does not violate,
misappropriate or infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any Third
Party. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not result in the material loss or material impairment of the right of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to own or use any of the Company's
intellectual property, and the Surviving REIT and its Subsidiaries will have
substantially the same rights to own or use the Company intellectual property
following the consummation of such transaction as the Company and its
Subsidiaries had prior to the consummation of such transactions, except such
rights as do not and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     3.23 Insurance. Section 3.23 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a correct and complete list of the insurance policies held by, or for the
benefit of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries including the underwriter of
such policies and the amount of coverage thereunder. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have paid, or caused to be paid, all premiums due under such
policies and are not in default with respect to any obligations under such
policies other than as do not and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any
written notice of cancellation or termination with respect to any existing
insurance policy set forth in Section 3.23 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
that is held by, or for the benefit of, any of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or that relates to any Company Property.

Company and each Company Subsidiary has had in place "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) designed and maintained to ensure that (i) transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets, (ii) all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary in the reports that it files or submits to the
SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (iii) all such information is
accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. To
the Company's knowledge, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary's
records, systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored,
maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any
means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and


                                       34
<PAGE>
therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Company
or the applicable Company Subsidiary or their accountants.

     3.25 Definition of the Company's Knowledge. As used in this Agreement, the
phrase "to the knowledge of the Company," "to the knowledge of the Subsidiary"
or any similar phrase means the actual (as opposed to constructive or imputed)
knowledge of those individuals identified in Section 3.25 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. All employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not
listed in Section 3.25 of the Company Disclosure Schedule report directly or
indirectly to at least one of the individuals identified in Section 3.25 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

Company and its Subsidiaries to be contained in the Proxy Statement (as defined
in Section 6.1) and other documents to be filed with the SEC in connection
herewith will not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to holders of
Company Common Shares or at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting contain
any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make statements therein
not false or misleading at the time and in light of the circumstances under
which such statement is made, except that no representation is made by the
Company with respect to the information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or Merger
Partnership explicitly for inclusion therein. All documents that the Company is
responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the REIT Merger, the
Partnership Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                    COVENANTS

     6.1 Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting.

          (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
     Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement in
     preliminary form (the "Proxy Statement") and the Company shall respond as
     promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto.
     Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership shall cooperate with the Company
     in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, including, but
     not limited to, furnishing to the Company any and all information regarding
     Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership and their respective Affiliates
     as may be required to be disclosed therein as promptly as possible after
     the date hereof. The parties shall notify each other promptly of the
     receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the
     SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
     for additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all
     correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one
     hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
     Proxy Statement or the REIT Merger.

          (b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder
     Approval, any event occurs with respect to the Company, Partnership,
     Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Partnership or any change occurs with respect
     to other information to be included in the Proxy Statement, which is
     required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy
     Statement, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly notify
     the other party of such event and the Company shall promptly file with the
     SEC, with Parent's input and cooperation, any necessary amendment or
     supplement to the Proxy Statement.

          (c) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date of
     this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
     the holders of the Company Common Shares (the "Company Shareholders
     Meeting") for the purpose of


                                       43
<PAGE>
     seeking the Company Shareholder Approval. The Company shall cause the Proxy
     Statement to be mailed to such holders as promptly as practicable after the
     date of this Agreement. The Company shall, through the Company Board,
     recommend to holders of the Company Common Shares that they give the
     Company Shareholder Approval (the "Company Recommendation"), except to the
     extent that the Company Board shall have withdrawn or modified its adoption
     of this Agreement and its recommendation in the Proxy Statement, as
     permitted by and determined in accordance with Section 6.4(b).
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
     Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting to the
     extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to
     the Proxy Statement is provided to the holders of Company Common Shares
     sufficiently in advance of a vote on this Agreement and the REIT Merger to
     ensure that such vote occurs on the basis of full and complete information
     as required under applicable Law.

     6.2 Other Filings. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub each shall properly prepare and
file any other filings required under the Exchange Act or any other federal,
state or foreign law relating to the Mergers (including filings, if any,
required under the HSR Act) (collectively, the "Other Filings"). Each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the other of the receipt of
any comments on, or any request for amendments or supplements to, any of the
Other Filings by the SEC or any other Governmental Entity or official, and each
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall supply the other with copies of all
correspondence between it and each of its representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or the members of its staff or any other appropriate governmental
official, on the other hand, with respect to any of the Other Filings. The
Company, Parent and Merger Sub each shall promptly obtain and furnish the other
(a) the information which may be reasonably required in order to make such Other
Filings and (b) any additional information which may be requested by a
Governmental Entity and which the parties reasonably deem appropriate.

     6.3 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, but subject to the obligation to act in good faith, and subject at all
times to the Company's and its trustees' right and duty to act in a manner
consistent with their duties under applicable Law, each of the parties hereto
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the
Mergers and to cooperate with each other in connection with the foregoing,
including the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any necessary
consents, approvals, orders, exemptions and authorizations by or from any public
or private Third Party, including, without limitation, any that are required to
be obtained under any federal, state or local law or regulation or any contract,
agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which any of their
respective properties or assets are bound, to defend all lawsuits or other legal
proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers, to
effect all necessary registrations and Other Filings and submissions of
information requested by a Governmental Entity, and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause to be lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order
or other order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the
Mergers.

     6.4 No Solicitations.

          (a) Except as permitted by this Agreement, the Company shall not, and
     shall not authorize or cause any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
     officers, trustees or employees or any investment banker, financial
     advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it, to
     (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or facilitate, (including by way
     of furnishing non-public information), any inquiries with respect to an
     Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined), or the making of any
     proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an
     Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) initiate, participate in or knowingly
     encourage any discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition
     Proposal; provided, however, that, at any time prior to the Company
     Shareholder Approval, if the Company receives a bona fide Acquisition
     Proposal that was not solicited after the date of this Agreement or that
     did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.4(a), the Company
     may furnish, or cause to be furnished, non-public information with respect
     to the Company to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal and may
     participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such Acquisition
     Proposal if (A) the Company Board, or any committee thereof to which the
     power to consider such matters has been delegated, determines in good faith
     (after having obtained sufficient preliminary information upon which to
     make such determination), after consultation with outside counsel, that
     failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
     duties to the Company or its shareholders under applicable Law, (B) prior
     to taking such action, the Company enters into a confidentiality agreement
     with respect to such Acquisition Proposal that contains provisions no less
     restrictive than the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 6.6
     hereof) and (C) the Company Board determines in good faith (after having
     obtained sufficient preliminary information upon which to make such
     determination), after consultation with its financial advisors, that such
     Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal.
     The Company shall promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days,
     notify Parent orally and in writing after receipt by the Company of any
     Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and conditions thereof,
     to the extent known. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
     Agreement, the Company shall not be required to disclose to Parent or
     Merger Sub the identity of the Third Party making any Acquisition Proposal
     and, except as provided in Sections 6.4(b) and 8.1(e), shall have no duty
     to notify or update Parent or Merger Sub on the status of discussions or
     negotiations (including the status of such Acquisition Proposal or any
     amendments or proposed amendments thereto) between the Company and such
     Person. Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
     Company will, and will instruct its Subsidiaries, and their respective
     officers, trustees, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
     accountants and other agents to, cease and terminate any existing
     activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
     heretofore with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal.

          (b) Subject to Section 8.1(e) hereof, prior to the Company Shareholder
     Approval, the Company Board may not (i) withdraw, qualify or modify in a
     manner material and adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board's
     approval or recommendation, or if applicable, the approval or
     recommendation of any committee of the Company Board, of the Mergers, (ii)
     approve or recommend, or propose publicly to


                                       45
<PAGE>
     approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal to holders of the Company
     Common Shares or (iii) authorize, permit or cause the Company to enter into
     any definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, unless,
     in each such case, a Superior Proposal has been made and (x) the Company
     Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
     that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
     inconsistent with its duties to the Company or its shareholders under
     applicable Law, and (y) the Company provides Parent with notice of its
     decision to withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of this
     Agreement and the Mergers. In the event that the Company Board makes such
     determination, the Company may enter into a definitive agreement to effect
     a Superior Proposal, but not prior to three (3) Business Days after the
     Company (A) has provided Parent with written notice that the Company has
     elected to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) and
     otherwise complied with the Company's obligations in the preceding
     sentence, and (B) has set forth such other information required to be
     included therein as provided in Section 8.1(e).

          (c) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries
     shall cease immediately, and cause to be terminated, any and all existing
     activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
     heretofore with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead
     to, an Acquisition Proposal.

          (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit the Company
     from at any time taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
     contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
     Act or making any disclosure required by Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the
     Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A.

     6.5 Officers' and Directors' Indemnification.

          (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
     demand, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
     administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim, action,
     suit, demand, proceeding or investigation in which any Person who is now,
     or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to
     the Closing Date, a director, officer, employee, trustee, fiduciary or
     agent of the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries (each, an
     "Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is
     threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
     whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or
     was an officer, director, trustee, employee, fiduciary or agent of the
     Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the
     request of the Company as an, officer, director, trustee, employee,
     fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
     trust or other enterprise, or (ii) the negotiation, execution or
     performance of this Agreement, any agreement or document contemplated
     hereby or delivered in connection herewith, or any of the transactions
     contemplated hereby or thereby, whether in any case asserted or arising at
     or before or after the Closing Date, the parties hereto agree to cooperate
     and use their reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond
     thereto. It is understood and agreed that the Company shall indemnify and
     hold harmless, and after the Closing Date, the Surviving REIT shall
     indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by
     applicable Law,


                                       46
<PAGE>
     each Indemnified Party against any and all losses, claims, damages,
     liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
     expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection
     with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding
     or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim,
     action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or
     arising at or before or after the Closing Date), (A) the Company and, after
     the Closing Date, the Surviving REIT shall promptly pay expenses in advance
     of the final disposition of any such threatened or actual claim, action,
     suit, demand, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the
     fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, (B) the Indemnified Parties may
     retain a single counsel satisfactory to them, and the Company and the
     Surviving REIT shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
     for the Indemnified Parties within thirty (30) days after statements
     therefor are received, and (C) the Company and, after the Closing Date, the
     Surviving REIT will use its reasonable best efforts to assist in the
     vigorous defense of any such matter; provided, however, that neither the
     Company nor the Surviving REIT shall be liable for any settlement effected
     without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
     withheld, conditioned or delayed); and provided further that the Company
     and the Surviving REIT shall have no obligation hereunder to any
     Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
     ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and
     non-appealable, that indemnification by such entities of such Indemnified
     Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.
     Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
     6.5, upon learning of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
     demand, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Company and,
     after the Closing Date, the Surviving REIT thereof; provided that the
     failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of the Company and
     the Surviving REIT except to the extent, if any, such failure to promptly
     notify materially prejudices such party.

          (b) Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership each agree that all
     rights to indemnification existing in favor of, and all limitations on the
     personal liability of, each Indemnified Party provided for in the
     respective charters or bylaws (or other applicable organizational
     documents) of the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries or otherwise
     in effect as of the date hereof shall survive the Mergers and continue in
     full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date
     and, at the Closing Date, shall become the obligation of the Surviving
     REIT; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of
     any claims (each, a "Claim") asserted or made within such period shall
     continue until the final disposition of such Claim. From and after the
     Closing Date, the Surviving REIT also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
     the present and former officers and trustees of the Company in respect of
     acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date to the extent
     provided in any written indemnification agreements between the Company
     and/or one of the Company's Subsidiaries and the officers and trustees
     listed in Section 6.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

          (c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase a
     non-cancelable extended reporting period endorsement under the Company's
     existing directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage for the
     Company's directors, officers and trustees in


                                       47
<PAGE>
     the same form as presently maintained by the Company, with the same or
     comparably rated insurers as the Company's current insurer, which shall
     provide such directors, officers and trustees with coverage for six (6)
     years following the Closing Date of not less than the existing coverage
     under, and have other terms not less favorable to, the insured persons than
     the directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage presently
     maintained by the Company. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving REIT
     to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor
     all obligations thereunder.

          (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
     obligations under this Section 6.5 shall not be terminated or modified in
     such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section
     6.5 applies without the consent of each such affected indemnitee. This
     Section 6.5 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third
     party beneficiary rights to, the Indemnified Parties and their respective
     heirs and shall be binding on all successors of the Surviving REIT. Each of
     the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs shall be entitled to
     enforce the provisions of this Section 6.5.

          (e) In the event that, following the Closing Date, the Surviving REIT
     or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
     merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
     corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, (ii) transfers or
     conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person
     or (iii) commences a dissolution, liquidation, assignment for the benefit
     of creditors or similar action, then, and in each such case, proper
     provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
     REIT, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section
     6.5.

     6.6 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

          (a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company shall,
     and shall cause each of the Company's Subsidiaries to, (i) give Parent and
     its authorized representatives (including counsel, environmental
     consultants, financial advisors, lenders and auditors) reasonable access
     during normal business hours, and upon reasonable advance notice, to all
     properties, including interviewing tenants (provided however, that Parent
     shall be permitted to conduct environmental inspections only with the
     Company's prior written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld)
     and requesting reasonable and customary estoppel letters therefrom and
     requesting reasonable and customary estoppel letters from parties to loan
     agreements, encumbrances and Property Restrictions (provided that the
     obtaining of any such estoppel letter shall in no event be deemed to be a
     condition to Closing), facilities and books and records of the Company and
     the Company's Subsidiaries (ii) reasonably cooperate with the Parent's
     lenders (provided that the Company shall not be required to expend any
     funds or incur any liability in connection with such cooperation), (iii)
     permit such inspections, subject to the proviso in Section 6.6(a)(i), as
     Parent may reasonably require, including environmental and physical
     inspections including, without limitation, Phase II examinations, provided
     that the performance of such Phase II examinations shall be subject to the
     rights of the Company's tenants under the Company Leases, and furnish
     Parent with such financial


                                       48
<PAGE>
     and operating data and other information with respect to the business,
     properties and personnel of the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries as
     Parent may from time to time reasonably request and (iv) reasonably
     cooperate with any reasonable restructuring request of Parent's lenders
     (provided, that any such restructuring would not be effected prior to the
     Closing Date and nothing herein shall obligate the Company or any of the
     Company's Subsidiaries to take any irrevocable action or election prior to
     the Closing Date with respect thereto and the Company shall not be required
     to expend any funds or incur any liability in connection with such
     cooperation); provided, that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6
     shall affect or be deemed to modify any of the representations or
     warranties made by the Company hereto and all such access shall be
     coordinated through the Company or its designated representatives, in
     accordance with such reasonable procedures as they may establish.

          (b) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in
     confidence all such information on the terms and subject to the conditions
     contained in that certain confidentiality agreement between Parent and the
     Company dated April 8, 2005 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), provided,
     that Parent may disclose Evaluation Material thereunder to potential
     purchasers of Company Properties only with the Company's prior written
     consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided further that
     such Persons are subject to substantially the same confidentiality
     obligations as applicable to Parent and as set forth in this Agreement.

     6.7 Public Announcements. The Company and Parent shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to this Agreement or the Mergers and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other
party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be required
by Law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange or quotation system if the
party issuing such press release or making such public statement has used its
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain such
party's consent but has been unable to do so in a timely manner. In this regard,
the parties shall make a joint public announcement of the Mergers contemplated
hereby no later than the opening of trading on the Nasdaq National Market on the
Business Day following the date on which this Agreement is signed.

     6.8 Employee Benefit Arrangements.

          (a) After the Closing Date, all employees of the Company and the
     Company's Subsidiaries ("Company Employees") who are employed by Parent,
     including the Surviving REIT, shall, at the option of Parent, either
     continue to be eligible to participate in an "employee benefit plan", as
     defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (an "Employee Benefit Plan"), of the
     Company which is, at the option of Parent, continued by Parent, or
     alternatively shall be eligible to participate in the same manner as other
     similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries in a similar
     Employee Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or in which
     employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries participate after the Closing Date.
     With respect to each such Employee Benefit Plan of Parent, service with the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the predecessor of any of them shall
     be


                                       49
<PAGE>
     included for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting
     (if applicable) and determination of the level of entitlement to benefits
     under such Employee Benefit Plan. Parent shall, or shall cause its
     Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to, (i) waive all limitations as to
     preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
     participation and coverage requirements applicable to all Company Employees
     under any comparable welfare plan that such Company Employees may be
     eligible to participate in after the Closing Date, other than limitations
     or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such
     employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any
     comparable welfare plan maintained by the Company for such employees
     immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) provide each such Company
     Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
     Closing Date for the plan year within which the Closing Date occurs in
     satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under
     any welfare plans that such employees are eligible to participate in after
     the Closing Date.

          (b) At and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving
     REIT to honor in accordance with their terms all employment agreements,
     severance agreements, retention bonus agreements and other bonus, retention
     and severance obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, all of
     which are listed in Section 6.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and
     as may otherwise be agreed to by the Company and Parent, and the Company
     shall pay on the Closing Date to the applicable trustees, officers and
     employees any amounts with respect to such agreements and obligations that
     are payable by their terms at or before the Closing Date.

     6.9 Certain Tax Matters.

          (a) The Company shall take all actions, and refrain from taking all
     actions, as are necessary to ensure that the Company will qualify for
     taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for its current
     taxable year. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
     Closing Date, the Company shall facilitate all reasonable requests of
     Parent with respect to maintenance of the Company's REIT status for the
     Company's 2005 taxable year and, if applicable, 2006 taxable year.

          (b) The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
     cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and each Company
     Subsidiary required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date, including
     applicable extensions (including timely filing of Tax Returns for the
     fiscal year ended December 31, 2004). Any such Tax Returns shall be
     prepared in a manner consistent with the historic Tax accounting practices
     of the Company (except as may be required under applicable Tax Law). The
     Company shall pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. The Company
     shall provide to Parent copies of such Tax Returns that are to be filed on
     or prior to the Closing Date at least five (5) calendar days prior to the
     due date of such Tax Returns (including applicable extensions) and the
     Company shall accept any and all reasonable comments of Parent with respect
     to such Tax Returns.

     6.10 REIT Opinion. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the tax opinion described in Section 7.2(c) dated as of the Closing Date.

     6.11 Sale of Properties. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to facilitate the sale, on or after the Closing
Date, of Company Properties identified by Parent and agreed to by the Company on
terms and conditions mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent, each party
agreeing not to unreasonably withhold consent to a proposal by the other with
respect to such sale.

     6.12 Equity Raising Property Sales.

          (a) Between the date of this Agreement and the thirtieth (30th) day
     preceding the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, Parent agrees, upon
     the written request of the Company, to promptly purchase (in no event later
     than thirty (30) days following receipt of the Company's written request)
     all of the Company's right, title and interest in and to one or more
     Company Properties identified by the Company in its sole discretion from
     the list of Company Properties in Section 6.12(a) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule (the "Identified Company Properties") for an aggregate purchase
     price of up to $25,000,000 payable by wire transfer of immediately
     available funds. The Company and Parent agree that the purchase price of
     the Identified Company Properties selected for sale by the Company shall be
     determined by dividing the then current base rent on such Identified
     Company Properties by seven percent (7%). The Company shall deliver a
     general warranty deed (to an affiliated entity designated by Parent) and
     take and do all such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to carry
     out the sale of such Identified Company Properties to Parent consistent
     with the terms of this Agreement and customary real estate closings of
     similar properties. The Identified Company Properties shall be delivered
     free and clear of all mortgages, liens, encumbrances and other title
     exceptions not disclosed in the policies of title insurance listed in
     Section 6.12(a) and the Company shall pay all transfer taxes, title
     insurance premiums and other closing expenses (collectively, "Transaction
     Costs") related to the sale.

          (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
     6.12 or elsewhere in this Agreement, in the event that following Parent's
     acquisition of such Identified Company Properties this Agreement is
     terminated pursuant to Article VIII hereof:

               (i) the Company shall have the right, exercisable in its
          discretion by delivery of written notice to Parent on or before the
          date which is the six (6) month anniversary of the effective date of
          the termination of this Agreement, to require Parent to sell all of
          such Identified Company Properties previously purchased by Parent
          pursuant to Section 6.12(a) above to the Company at the same purchase
          price paid by Parent; and

               (ii) Parent shall have the right, exercisable in its discretion
          by delivery of written notice to the Company within thirty (30) days
          preceding the date which is the six (6) month anniversary of the
          effective date of the termination of this Agreement, to require the
          Company to repurchase all of such Identified Company Properties
          previously purchased by Parent pursuant to Section 6.12(a) above for
          the same purchase price paid by Parent.


                                       51
<PAGE>
          (c) In the event that either the Company or Parent exercises its right
     under Section 6.12(b) above to repurchase or sell these Identified Company
     Properties, as applicable:

               (i) the Company shall promptly (but in any event within thirty
          (30) days) pay to Parent the purchase price for such Identified
          Company Properties by wire transfer of immediately available funds;

               (ii) Parent, upon receipt of such payment, shall deliver a
          special warranty deed and take and do all such other actions as may be
          reasonably necessary to carry out the sale of such Identified Company
          Properties consistent with the terms of this Agreement and customary
          real estate closings of similar properties. Parent shall deliver such
          Identified Company Properties to the Company "as-is", free and clear
          of all liens and encumbrances, other than those (x) existing on the
          date Parent purchased such Identified Company Properties from the
          Company, and (y) created by, or which are the obligation of, the
          tenants of any of the Identified Company Properties; and

               (iii) Parent shall pay or reimburse the Company for all
          Transaction Costs incurred by the Company related to the sale of the
          Identified Company Properties.

          (d) The rights of the Company and Parent under Section 6.12(b) above
     to repurchase or sell these Identified Company Properties, as applicable,
     shall automatically terminate unless exercised within the time periods set
     forth in Section 6.12(b) above.

          (e) Between the date of this Agreement and the Company Shareholders
     Meeting and upon written notice to Parent, the Company may sell, in one or
     more transactions, all of the Company's right, title and interest in and to
     one or more of the Identified Company Properties not previously sold or
     then under contract for sale to Parent pursuant to Section 6.12(a) above,
     to any Third Parties for an aggregate purchase price of up to $200,000,000
     provided such sales meet the guidelines set forth in Section 6.12(e) of the
     Company Disclosure Schedule.

     6.13 Interim Period Dividends. With the exception of the dividends
contemplated in Section 5.1 of this Agreement, during the Interim Period, the
Company shall not declare a dividend in an amount exceeding the minimum dividend
necessary to avoid the imposition of excise tax under Section 4981 of the Code
for the 2005 taxable year.

     7.1 Conditions to the Obligations of Each Party to Effect the Mergers. The
respective obligations of each party to effect the Mergers are subject to the
satisfaction or waiver by consent of the other party, at or prior to the Closing
Date, of each of the following conditions:

     Company Shareholder Approval.

          (b) Other Regulatory Approvals. All material approvals, authorizations

     statutory waiting periods relating to such approvals, authorizations and
     consents shall have expired or been terminated.

          (c) No Injunctions, Orders or Restraints; Illegality. No preliminary
     or permanent injunction or other order issued by a court or other
     Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall be in effect, and no
     Law shall have been enacted or promulgated, which would have the effect of
     (i) making the consummation of the Mergers illegal, or (ii) otherwise
     prohibiting the consummation of the Mergers; provided, however, that prior
     to a party asserting this condition such party shall, in the case of an
     injunction or order, have used its reasonable best efforts to prevent the
     entry of any such injunction or other order and to appeal as promptly as
     possible any such injunction or other order that may be entered.

     7.2 Conditions to Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. The obligations of
Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership to effect the Mergers are further
subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions, any one or more of
which may be waived by Parent at or prior to the Closing Date:

     warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement shall be true and
     correct (determined without regard to any materiality or material adverse
     effect qualification contained in any representation or warranty) at and as
     of the Closing Date, as if made at and as of such time (except to the
     extent a representation or warranty is made as of a time other than the
     Closing Date, in which case such representation or warranty shall be true
     and correct at and as of such time), except where the failure of such
     representations and warranties to be true and correct does not have or
     would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Parent
     shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company, dated as
     of the Closing Date, to the foregoing effect.

          (b) Performance and Obligations of the Company. The Company shall have
     performed or complied in all material respects with all material agreements
     and material covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or
     complied with by it on or prior to the Closing Date; provided, however,
     that the Company shall not be deemed to have failed to so perform or comply
     with such material agreements or material covenants if it cures such
     non-performance or non-compliance within a reasonable period of time (not
     to exceed five (5) business days of the occurrence of such event). Parent
     shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company, dated as
     of the Closing Date, to the foregoing effect.

          (c) Opinion. Parent shall have received a tax opinion of Pillsbury
     Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, tax counsel to the Company, or such other law
     firm as may be


                                       53
<PAGE>
     reasonably approved by Parent as to the REIT Merger dated as of the Closing
     Date in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto, which opinion concludes
     (subject to customary assumptions, qualifications and representations,
     including representations made by the Company and its Subsidiaries) that
     (A) the Company qualified as a REIT under the Code for all taxable years
     since 1998, the year in which the Company first made a REIT tax election,
     through December 31, 2004, and (B) the Company is organized in conformity
     with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code, and its
     current method of operation and ownership will enable it to meet the
     requirements for qualification as a REIT for the current taxable year
     assuming for these purposes that the Company will continue, following the
     Closing, to be organized and operated in accordance with the requirements
     for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code.

          (d) Absence of Material Adverse Change. There shall not have occurred
     an event, change or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, has
     had a Material Adverse Effect.

     7.3 Conditions to Obligations of the Company. The obligations of the
Company and Partnership to effect the Mergers are further subject to the
satisfaction of the following conditions, any one or more of which may be waived
by the Company at or prior to the Closing Date:

          (a) Representations and Warranties. Each of the representations and
     warranties of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership contained in this
     Agreement shall be true and correct (determined without regard to any
     materiality or material adverse effect qualification contained in any
     representation or warranty) at and as of the Closing Date, as if made at
     and as of such time (except to the extent a representation or warranty is
     made as of a time other than the Closing Date, in which case such
     representation or warranty shall be true and correct at and as of such
     time), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to
     be true and correct does not have or would not reasonably be likely to have
     a Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall have received a certificate
     signed on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership, dated the
     Closing Date, to the foregoing effect.

          (b) Performance of Obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger
     Partnership. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership shall have
     performed or complied in all material respects with all material agreements
     and material covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or
     complied with by it on or prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall
     have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub and
     Merger Partnership, dated as of the Closing Date, to the foregoing effect.

     7.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. No party may rely on the failure of
any condition set forth in this Article VII to be satisfied if such failure was
caused by such party's failure to use its own commercially reasonable efforts to
consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereunder.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                        TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

     8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at any time
prior to the Closing Date, whether before or after the receipt of Company
Shareholder Approval:

          (a) by the mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the
     Company;

          (b) by either of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger
     Sub, on the other hand, by written notice to the other:

               (i) if, upon a vote at a duly held meeting of holders of the
          Company Common Shares (or at any adjournment or postponement thereof),
          held to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company
          Shareholder Approval is not obtained;

               (ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
          have issued an order, decree, judgment, injunction or taken any other
          action (which order, decree, judgment, injunction or other action the
          parties hereto shall have used their reasonable best efforts to lift),
          which permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits or makes
          illegal the consummation of the Mergers, and such order, decree,
          judgment, injunction or other action shall have become final and
          non-appealable, provided, however, that the party terminating this
          Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall have used
          commercially reasonable efforts to have such offer, decree, judgment,
          injunction or other action vacated; or

               (iii) if the consummation of the Mergers shall not have occurred
          on or before February 3, 2006, provided, however, that in the event
          that, on or before December 26, 2005, the Proxy Statement has not been
          cleared by the SEC for dissemination, such date may be extended by
          Parent or the Company through a date on or before March 31, 2006 (the
          "Drop Dead Date"); provided, further, however, that in such event the
          Closing shall not occur prior to March 15, 2006; provided, further,
          however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
          8.1(b)(iii) shall not be available to either party if such party's
          failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement in a material
          respect has been the proximate cause of, or resulted in, the failure
          of the Mergers to occur on or before the Drop Dead Date.

          (c) by written notice from Parent to the Company, if the Company
     breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its
     representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which
     breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition
     set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) and such condition is incapable of
     being satisfied by the Drop Dead Date;

          (d) by written notice from the Company to Parent if Parent or Merger
     Sub breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its
     representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which
     breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition
     set forth in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) and such condition is incapable of
     being satisfied by the Drop Dead Date;


                                       55
<PAGE>
          (e) by written notice from the Company to Parent, in connection with
     entering into a definitive agreement to effect a Superior Proposal in
     accordance with Section 6.4; provided, however, that prior to terminating
     this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e), the Company shall have
     provided Parent with at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice
     of the Company's decision to so terminate. Such notice shall indicate in
     reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of such Superior
     Proposal, including the amount and form of the proposed consideration and
     whether such Superior Proposal is subject to any material conditions and
     provided further that an election by the Company to terminate this
     Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) shall not be effective until the
     Company shall have paid the Break-up Fee to Parent as provided in Section
     8.2(b);

          (f) by written notice of Parent or Merger Sub to the Company, if the
     Company Board shall (A) fail to include a recommendation in the Proxy
     Statement that the holders of the Company Common Shares vote to approve the
     REIT Merger and this Agreement, (B) withdraw or modify, in a manner
     material and adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, such recommendation, or (C)
     recommend that the holders of the Company Common Shares accept or approve
     any Acquisition Proposal; or

          (g) by written notice of Parent or Merger Sub to the Company, if the
     Company shall fail to obtain the opinion of counsel described in Section
     7.2(c) hereof.

     8.2 Effect of Termination.

          (a) Subject to the remainder of this Section 8.2 and to Section 8.3,
     in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1,
     this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect,
     without any liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
     Partnership or Merger Partnership and each of their respective directors,
     trustees, officers, employees, partners, stockholders or shareholders and
     all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease, except for the
     agreements contained in Sections 6.6 (Confidentiality), 6.7 (Public
     Announcements), 8.2 (Effect of Termination), 8.3 (Fees and Expenses) and
     Article IX (General Provisions); provided, however, that nothing contained
     in this Section 8.2(a) shall relieve any party from liabilities or damages
     arising out of any fraud or willful breach by such party of any of its
     representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
     this Agreement or a failure or refusal by such party to consummate the
     transactions contemplated hereby when such party was obligated to do so in
     accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
     8.1(e), or by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the
     Company shall pay to Parent, subject to the provisions of Section 8.4(a),
     an amount in cash equal to $40,000,000 (the "Break-Up Fee"). In addition,
     if (A) prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, an Acquisition Proposal
     shall have been publicly made (and not subsequently withdrawn), (B) this
     Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to


                                       56
<PAGE>
     Section 8.1(b)(i), or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c), at a time when
     the Company Shareholder Approval has not been obtained, and (C) the Company
     consummates an Acquisition Proposal within twelve (12) months of such
     termination, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Break-Up Fee. For the
     avoidance of doubt, the amount of any fees or expenses paid to Parent
     pursuant to Section 8.3(c) shall be deducted from the payment of any
     Break-Up Fee required by this Section 8.2(b) such that the maximum amount
     payable by the Company in the event of a termination under Section
     8.1(b)(i), 8.1(c), 8.1(e) or 8.1(f) shall be $40,000,000. Payment of the
     Break-Up Fee required by this Section 8.2(b) shall be payable by the
     Company to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds (i) in
     the case of termination of this Agreement by the Company under Section
     8.1(e), concurrently with the effective date of such termination (i.e.
     following the three Business Days waiting period), (ii) in the case of
     termination of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub under Section 8.1(f),
     within three (3) Business Days after the date of termination, or (iii) in
     case of a situation contemplated by the second sentence of this Section
     8.2(b), on the same Business Day as the consummation of such Acquisition
     Proposal.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
     and Merger Sub hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to
     any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), Section
     8.1(f), Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(c), in circumstances where the
     Break-Up Fee is payable in accordance with Section 8.2(b), the payment of
     the Break-Up Fee shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to any
     claim for damages or any other claim which Parent or Merger Sub would
     otherwise be entitled to assert against the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, or against any of their
     respective trustees, officers, employees, partners, managers, members or
     shareholders, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
     contemplated hereby and shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
     available to Parent and Merger Sub, except for the recovery of costs and
     expenses pursuant to Section 8.3(c). The parties hereto expressly
     acknowledge and agree that, in light of the difficulty of accurately
     determining actual damages with respect to the foregoing upon any
     termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), Section 8.1(f),
     Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(c), in circumstances where the Break-Up
     Fee is payable in accordance with Section 8.2(b), the rights to payment
     under Section 8.2(b): (i) constitute a reasonable estimate of the damages
     that will be suffered by reason of any such proposed or actual termination
     of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), Section 8.1(f), Section
     8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(c), and (ii) shall be in full and complete
     satisfaction of any and all damages arising as a result of the foregoing.
     Except for nonpayment of the amounts set forth in Section 8.2(b) or 8.3,
     Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that, upon any termination of this
     Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), Section 8.1(f), Section 8.1(b)(i) or
     Section 8.1(c), in circumstances where the Break-Up Fee is payable in
     accordance with Section 8.2(b), in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub, (i)
     seek to obtain any recovery or judgment against the Company, the Company's
     Subsidiaries, or any of their respective assets, or against any of their
     respective trustees, officers, employees, partners, managers, members or
     shareholders, or (ii) be entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of
     any kind, including, without limitation, consequential, indirect or
     punitive damages.

     8.3 Fees and Expenses.

          (a) Except as set forth in Sections 8.3(b), 8.3(c) and 8.2, whether or
     not the Mergers are consummated, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in
     connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this
     Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
     limitation, all fees, costs and expenses of agents, representatives,
     counsel and accountants shall be paid by the party incurring such fees,
     costs or expenses.

          (b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
     8.1(d), Parent shall pay to the Company within three (3) Business Days
     after the date of termination all documented, reasonable out-of-pocket
     costs and expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
     expenses of lawyers, accountants, financial advisors and investment
     bankers, incurred by the Company or Partnership solely in connection with
     the entering into of this Agreement and the carrying out of any and all
     acts contemplated hereunder, provided that such fees and expenses to be
     paid by Parent hereunder shall not exceed seven and one-half million
     dollars ($7,500,000).

          (c) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company or by Parent
     because the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained or
     (ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Sections 8.1(c), 8.1(e), 8.1(f)
     or 8.1(g), the Company shall pay to Parent within three (3) Business Days
     after the date of termination, all documented, reasonable out-of-pocket
     costs and expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
     expenses of lawyers, lenders, accountants, financial advisors, and
     investment bankers, incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Partnership
     solely in connection with the entering into of this Agreement and the
     carrying out of any and all acts contemplated hereunder, provided that the
     amount of such fees and expenses to be paid by the Company hereunder shall
     not exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000) in the case of clause (i) of
     this Section 8.3(c), and seven and one-half million dollars ($7,500,000) in
     the case of clause (ii) of this Section 8.3(c). As provided in Section
     8.2(b), the amount of any fees or expenses paid to Parent pursuant to this
     Section 8.3(c) shall be deducted from the payment of any Break-Up Fee
     required by Section 8.2(b) such that the maximum amount payable by the
     Company in the event of a termination under Section 8.1(b)(i), 8.1(c),
     8.1(e) or 8.1(f) shall be $40,000,000.

          (d) If either party fails to pay to the other party any amounts due
     under Section 8.2 or 8.3, the party so failing shall pay the reasonable
     costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees
     and expenses) in connection with any action, including, without limitation,
     the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment.

The payment of expenses set forth herein is not an exclusive remedy, but is in
addition to any other rights or remedies available to the parties hereto
(whether at law or in equity).

     8.4 Payment of Amount or Expense.

          (a) In the event that the Company is obligated to pay Parent the
     Break-Up Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or the Company or Parent is
     obligated to pay the other the expenses set forth in Section 8.3
     (collectively, the "Section 8.2 Amount"), the Company or Parent (the
     "Payor") shall pay to the other party (the "Payee") from the applicable
     Section 8.2 Amount deposited into escrow, if any, in accordance with the
     next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Section 8.2 Amount
     and (ii) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Payee
     without causing the Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
     856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount
     did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(H) or
     856(c)(3)(I) of the Code ("Qualifying Income"), as determined by the
     Payee's independent certified public accountants, plus (2) in the event the
     Payee receives either (X) a letter from the Payee's counsel indicating that
     the Payee has received a ruling from the IRS described in Section
     8.4(b)(ii) or (B) an opinion from the Payee's outside counsel as described
     in Section 8.4(b)(ii), an amount equal to the Section 8.2 Amount less the
     amount payable under clause (1) above. To secure the Payor's obligation to
     pay these amounts, the Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash
     equal to the Section 8.2 Amount with an escrow agent selected by the Payor
     and on such terms (subject to Section 8.4(b)) as shall be mutually agreed
     upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent, provided that in the case
     where the Payor is the Company and the Payee is Parent, the payment or
     deposit into escrow shall be at Parent's option. The payment or deposit
     into escrow of the Section 8.2 Amount pursuant to this Section 8.4(a) shall
     be made at the time the Payor is obligated to pay the Payee such amount
     pursuant to Section 8.3 or Section 8.2(b), as applicable, by wire transfer
     or bank check.

          (b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Section 8.2 Amount in
     escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Payee unless the
     escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter
     from the Payee's independent certified public accountants indicating the
     maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Payee without
     causing the Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2)
     and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not
     constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from the Payee's
     accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall
     release such amount to the Payee, or (ii) a letter from the Payee's counsel
     indicating that the Payee received a ruling from the IRS holding that the
     receipt by the Payee of the Section 8.2 Amount would either constitute
     Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning
     of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, the Payee's
     outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt
     by the Payee of the Section 8.2 Amount would either constitute Qualifying
     Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
     Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the escrow agent
     shall release the remainder of the Section 8.2 Amount to the Payee. The
     Payor agrees to amend this Section 8.4 at the reasonable request of the
     Payee in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Section 8.2 Amount that
     may be distributed to the Payee hereunder without causing the Payee to fail
     to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y)
     improve the Payee's chances of securing a favorable ruling described in
     this Section 8.4(b) or (z) assist the Payee in


                                       59
<PAGE>
     obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described
     in this Section 8.4(b). The escrow agreement shall also provide that any
     portion of the Section 8.2 Amount held in escrow for five years shall be
     released by the escrow agent to the Payor. The Payor shall not be a party
     to such escrow agreement and shall not bear any cost of or have liability
     resulting from the escrow agreement.

     8.5 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at any time
before or after any approval hereof by holders of the Company Common Shares;
provided, however, that after any such approval, no amendment shall be made
which by Law requires further approval by such shareholders without obtaining
such approval.

     8.6 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
parties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c)
waive compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of the party against which such waiver or extension is to be
enforced. Except as so waived, no action taken or omitted to be taken pursuant
to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any investigation by or on
behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking
such action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a
breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver
of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.
