**ARTICLE 3**

**PURCHASE PRICE**

3.1 _Purchase Price._ The purchase price for the Purchased Assets and the
covenant not to compete described in _Section 7.13_ (the " _Purchase Price_
") shall be determined in accordance with this _Article 3_ and shall equal:

(a) $8,130,000,000 (the " _Closing Date Payment_ ") minus

(b) the Closing Date Balance Sheet Adjustment Amount plus

(c) the Assumed Liabilities.

3.2 _Determination of Closing Date Balance Sheet Adjustment._

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date (but not later than
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date), Abbott and its Affiliates shall
prepare, in accordance with GAAP and, where in accordance with GAAP, ****on a
basis consistent with the preparation of the balance sheets used to determine
the Minimum Net Worth**** , a balance sheet as of the Closing Date of the
Business (the " _Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") and deliver the
Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet to the Independent Accounting Firm.
 Concurrently with the delivery of the Preliminary Closing Date
Balance Sheet, Abbott shall deliver to GE (i) a schedule showing all
adjustments reflected on the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet resulting
from items not in the ordinary course of the Business in respect of the
period from the Performance Balance Sheet Date to the Closing Date and (ii) a
schedule showing all adjustments resulting from material changes to GAAP that
are effective between the Performance Balance Sheet Date and prior to the
Closing Date. For purposes of determining the Preliminary Closing Balance
Sheet, Abbott shall continue to depreciate and amortize long-term assets
consistent with its policies for depreciating and amortizing long-term assets
used in determining the Minimum Net Worth. Abbott and its Affiliates shall
cause the Independent Accounting Firm to conduct an audit of the Preliminary
Closing Date Balance Sheet as promptly as reasonably possible (but not later
than ninety (90) days after receipt thereof) and, upon completion of such
audit (but not later than ninety (90) days after such receipt), to deliver a
written notice with respect to the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet to
each of GE and Abbott setting forth:

(i) a summary of all adjustments, if any, to the Preliminary Closing Date
Balance Sheet necessary to permit the Independent Accounting Firm to deliver
the audit report described below; and

(ii) an opinion stating that the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet
(after giving effect to such adjustments) as audited by such firm has been
prepared in accordance with GAAP and, where in accordance with GAAP, on a
basis consistent with the preparation of the balance sheets used to determine
the Minimum Net Worth (such written notice and related summary and audit
report being herein called the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet Audit Report_
").

   

The Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, as so determined but after giving
effect to the adjustments referred to in clause (i), is herein called the "
_Closing Date Balance Sheet_."

(b) The parties hereto shall make available to each other and the Independent
Accounting Firm such books, records and other information (including work
papers) as any of the foregoing may reasonably request to prepare or review,
as applicable, the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet.  The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid by GE.

(c) If the Independent Accounting Firm concludes that it is unable to
determine one or more issues or amounts necessary to complete an audit of the
Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet hereunder and prepare and deliver the
Closing Date Balance Sheet Audit Report, it shall promptly so notify GE and
Abbott who shall endeavor to jointly agree on such issue or amount. If GE and
Abbott are unable to reach a written agreement concerning such issue or
amount within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, the issue or
amount in question shall be determined in accordance with the Alternative
Dispute Resolution (" _ADR_ ") provisions set forth on _Schedule 13.8_ , the
result of which shall be binding upon the parties. The decision of the
neutral as to the issue or amount in question shall be conclusive and binding
for purposes of use hereunder by the Independent Accounting Firm. Following
the determination of any such issue or amount by written agreement of GE and
Abbott or by ADR, the Independent Accounting Firm shall proceed to complete
its audit and the preparation and delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet
Audit Report as contemplated in _Section 3.2(a)_. ADR costs under this
_Section 3.2(c)_ shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by GE and fifty percent
(50%) by Abbott, except that each party shall be responsible for its own
expenses (including legal expenses) and the costs of any witnesses selected
by such party. The place for such ADR shall be Chicago, Illinois or at such
other place as may be agreed upon by GE and Abbott.

3.3 _Closing Date Balance Sheet Adjustment Amount Payment._ Promptly (but
not later than five (5) days) after the completion of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet Audit Report pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_ , the parties shall
determine whether the Minimum Net Worth Amount exceeds the Net Worth
reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet (without, when making such
determination, taking into account any changes or adjustments resulting from
the Bonus Amount, from the ordinary course of the Business since the
Performance Balance Sheet Date or from material changes in GAAP that are
effective after the Performance Balance Sheet Date and prior to the Closing
Date (i.e., ordinary course changes to the Business and material changes in
GAAP shall not result in a Closing Date Balance Sheet Adjustment Amount)).
Abbott shall pay to GE, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such bank account of GE as GE shall designate in writing to Abbott, an amount
equal to any such excess, plus interest on such excess from the Closing Date
to the date of payment thereof at the Agreed Rate (the " _Closing Date
Balance Sheet Adjustment Amount_ ").

3.4 _Purchase Price Allocation; Withholding._

(a) No later than fifteen (15) days after the date of this Agreement, Abbott
shall provide GE with (i) an allocation by country of the Closing Date
Payment based on an estimate of the fair market values of the Purchased
Assets (less the Assumed Liabilities) and



 

18  

   

the covenant not to compete described in _Section 7.13_ (the "
_Estimated Country Allocation_ ") and (ii) if required by applicable Law (and
only to the extent required), an allocation by asset category of the
Estimated Country Allocation within a particular country (the " _Estimated
In-Country Allocation_ "). Within forty-five (45) days after Abbott provides
such allocations, but in no event later than thirty (30) days prior to the
Closing Date, Abbott and GE shall negotiate in good faith and attempt
to agree upon the Estimated Country Allocation and Estimated In-
Country Allocation. If, within that period, Abbott and GE are unable to
agree on the Estimated Country Allocation or Estimated In-Country Allocation,
the unresolved allocations in those countries where applicable Law requires
Abbott and GE to agree on an allocation either prior to the Closing Date or
at any date prior to the date of the Final Country Allocation or Final In-
Country Allocation shall be determined by Ernst and Young LLP or another
internationally-recognized independent accounting firm or appraisal firm
mutually selected by Abbott and GE (the " _Allocation Firm_ ") using
customary valuation methodologies; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Allocation Firm shall make its determination no later than five (5)
days prior to the Closing Date.

  

(b) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date Balance Sheet Adjustment
Amount (if applicable) and the Assumed Liabilities are determined, but in no
event later than forty-five (45) days thereafter, Abbott and GE shall, with
respect to each country for which an Estimated Country Allocation or
Estimated In-Country Allocation was agreed to by Abbott and GE or determined
by the Allocation Firm, negotiate in good faith and attempt to agree upon an
allocation of the final Purchase Price (including the Assumed Liabilities) to
the Purchased Assets  and covenant not to compete described in _Section 7.13_
by country and by asset category within that country.  Such allocations
shall be based upon the Estimated Country Allocation and Estimated In-Country
Allocation agreed to by Abbott and GE or determined by the Allocation Firm,
as the case may be, as appropriately adjusted to reflect the Closing Date
Balance Sheet Adjustment Amount (if applicable), the Assumed Liabilities and
any other information that has become available since the determination of
the Estimated Country Allocation and Estimated In-Country Allocation. If
Abbott and GE are unable to agree on such allocations, the unresolved
allocations in those countries where applicable Law requires Abbott and GE to
agree on an allocation shall be determined by the Allocation Firm using
customary valuation methodologies within thirty (30) days following the
submission of the dispute to it. Any allocation agreed to by Abbott and
GE under this _Section 3.4(b)_ or determined by the Allocation Firm
is hereafter referred to as the " _Final Country Allocation_ " (in the case
of an allocation by country) and " _Final In-Country Allocation_ " (in the
case of an allocation by asset category).

  

(c) Any determination made by the Allocation Firm shall be, absent manifest
error, final and binding on GE, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, and
Abbott, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates. The fees and expenses of the
Allocation Firm shall be shared equally between Abbott and GE.

  

(d) Each of Abbott, GE and each of their respective Affiliates shall (i) be
bound by the Final Country Allocation and the Final In-Country Allocation for
purposes of determining Taxes and (ii) prepare and file, and cause its
Affiliates to prepare and file, its Tax Returns on a basis consistent with
the Final Country Allocation and the Final In-Country Allocation.  None of
Abbott, GE or their respective Affiliates shall take any position
inconsistent with the Final Country Allocation or the Final In-
Country Allocation in any Tax Return, in any

        

refund claim, in any litigation, or otherwise unless required by a final
determination by an applicable taxing authority. A Final Country Allocation
and Final In-Country Allocation shall only be required where applicable Law
requires Abbott and GE to agree upon such an allocation (and only to the
extent so required). In all other cases, if Abbott and GE are unable to agree
upon an allocation in good faith, each party shall be entitled to follow its
own allocation (without regard to the other partys allocation).
 Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, if (i) a payment may
be required to be made from Abbott to GE or from GE to Abbott under
this Agreement, (ii) the amount of such payment is dependant upon an
allocation of the Purchase Price and (iii) the parties cannot agree upon such
allocation, then solely for purposes of determining the amount of such
payment, dispute resolution mechanisms similar to those described in this
_Section 3.4_ shall be used to determine the allocation necessary to
determine the amount of such payment.

  

(e) Within ten (10) days following the date of this Agreement, Abbott shall
deliver to GE a list setting forth, for each jurisdiction in which Abbott or
its Affiliates have Purchased Assets, the complete company name and other
necessary information of Abbott or its designated Affiliates that shall sell
the Purchased Assets. Within twenty-five (25) days of its receipt of Abbotts
list pursuant to the preceding sentence, GE shall deliver to Abbott a list
setting forth for each jurisdiction where Abbott or its designated Affiliates
have Purchased Assets, the complete company name and other necessary
information of GE or its designated Affiliates that shall acquire the
Purchased Assets in each relevant jurisdiction. Such list shall be amended
as necessary to reflect changes occurring prior to the Closing Date.

  

(f) GE shall make any required withholding of Taxes from the Purchase Price
and shall pay Abbott the Purchase Price net of any such withholding. Except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, GE shall have no obligation to
gross-up, indemnify or otherwise compensate Abbott for any withholding Tax
due or imposed with respect to the Purchase Price to the extent required by
applicable Law. No later than five (5) days prior to the Closing, GE shall
provide _Schedule 3.4(f)_ to Abbott which shall set forth the jurisdictions
in which any of GE or any of its Affiliates is obligated to withhold Taxes on
payment of the Purchase Price. Abbott shall reasonably cooperate with GE
to enable GE to determine its withholding obligation. GE shall reasonably
cooperate with Abbott in obtaining any exemption or reduction in withholding
Tax to which Abbott or any of its Affiliates is entitled under applicable
Law.

  

 **ARTICLE 4**

Affiliates has been required to post any material security under Section 307
of ERISA or Section 401(a)(29) of the Code with respect to any Employee Plan,

indenture, Contract, agreement, lease, sublease, license, permit, franchise

performance by GE of this Agreement do not and shall not require any Consent

Laws of any other relevant jurisdiction, (b) any notification, or where
appropriate, consultation, consent or negotiation with a works council,

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

pending or, to the Knowledge of GE, threatened, challenging the legality,
validity or enforceability of this Agreement or the consummation of the

7.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality._

  

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, upon reasonable notice, Abbott
shall: (i) afford GE and its authorized representatives reasonable access to
the properties and books and records of the Business, and (ii) furnish to the
officers, directors, employees, and authorized representatives of GE such
additional financial and operating data and other information regarding the
Business (or copies thereof) as GE may from time to time reasonably request;
_provided_ , however, that any such access or furnishing of information shall
be scheduled and coordinated through Abbotts Vice President, Global
Licensing/New Business Development (or his successor or successors) and shall
be conducted at GEs expense, during normal business hours, under the
supervision of Abbotts or its Affiliates personnel and in such a manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of the Business or
any of the Abbott Other Businesses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Abbott shall not be required to disclose any information
to GE if such disclosure would be reasonably likely to (x) cause
significant competitive harm to the Business if the transactions contemplated
hereby are not consummated, (y) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege or (z) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date hereof.

  

(b) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2006,
between GE Healthcare and Abbott, which Confidentiality Agreement was joined
by GE on December 12, 2006 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), shall
continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time
such Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of GE under this _Section
7.2(b)_ shall terminate; _provided_ , however, that, from and after the
Closing, except as would have been permitted under the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, (i) GE shall, and shall cause its
officers, directors, employees, authorized representatives and Affiliates to,
treat and hold as confidential, and not disclose to any Person, information
related to the discussions and negotiations between the parties regarding
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and all confidential
information relating to Abbott, the Abbott Other Businesses or the Excluded
Assets, and (ii) Abbott shall, and shall cause its officers, directors,
employees, authorized representatives and Affiliates to, treat and hold as
confidential, and not disclose to any Person, information related to the
discussions and negotiations between the parties regarding this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and all confidential information
relating to

        

the Business or GE. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior
to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect.

  

(c) Nothing provided to GE pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ shall in any way
amend or diminish GEs obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement. GE
acknowledges and agrees that any Evaluation Material (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) provided to GE pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ or
otherwise by or on behalf of Abbott or any officer, director, employee or
authorized representative shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

(d) Abbott and GE shall cooperate in the preparation of carve-out financial
statements of the Business, and make available to each other such Books,
Records and Files and other information and employees as either may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation thereof. Abbott shall
bear out-of-pocket costs relating to the preparation of such carve-out
financial statements for the Business.

  

7.3 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents._

  

(a) Each of Abbott and GE shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain promptly all Consents of all Governmental Authorities that may be or
become necessary for the performance of its and the other partys obligations
pursuant to, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement. Abbott and GE shall cooperate with one another in promptly seeking
to obtain all such Consents; _provided_ , however, that Abbott and GE shall
not be required to pay any fees or other payments to any such Governmental
Authorities in order to obtain any such Consent (other than normal filing
fees that are imposed by Law on Abbott or GE, as applicable, or Conveyance
Taxes). Neither Abbott, with respect to the Business, nor GE, with respect to
the business conducted by GE Healthcare, shall knowingly enter into any
acquisition or other agreement, make any announcement with respect to any
transaction or take any other action that could reasonably be expected to
have the effect of materially delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of
any Consent of a Governmental Authority under any Competition/Investment Law.
 Abbott and GE each agree to make, or to cause to be made, if required, an
appropriate filing of a notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act,
the EC Merger Regulation and any other applicable Competition/Investment Law,
in each case, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and
to supply promptly any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and the EC Merger Regulation or any
other Competition/Investment Laws. If any objections are asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Competition/Investment Law or if any suit or proceeding is instituted or
threatened by any Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any
of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of
any Competition/Investment Law, each of GE and Abbott shall use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly resolve such objections.
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any Consent of a Governmental Authority under any
Competition/Investment Law (i) Abbott shall not, without GEs prior written
consent, commit to any divestiture transaction involving the
Purchased Assets, or commit to alter the business or commercial practices
relating to the Business in any way, and (ii) neither GE nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to (A) divest or hold separate or

        

otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, the Business, any Purchased
Assets, any Abbott Product or any other assets or businesses of GE or any of
its Affiliates or (B) alter or restrict in any way the business or commercial
practices of GE, any of its Affiliates, or the Business.

  

(b) Abbott shall notify the FDA of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as required by paragraph 23 of the Consent Decree, a copy of which
has been provided to GE, and may provide the FDA with a copy of this
Agreement. GE shall (i) cooperate with Abbott and promptly comply with any
further inquiry or request for information from the FDA in connection with
such notice; (ii) at the Closing, assume and agree to fully satisfy all
Liabilities of Abbott, Miles D. White, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer, Abbott, and Thomas D. Brown, (former) President, Abbott
Diagnostics Division (collectively, the " _Abbott Consent Decree Defendants_
"), under the Consent Decree; (iii) cooperate with Abbott, using its
reasonable best efforts, to obtain an amendment to the Consent Decree to (x)
replace the defendants thereunder with GE or other GE Persons required by any
Governmental Authority (the " _GE Consent Decree Defendants_ "), (y) reflect
the assignment and assumption of all Liabilities of the Abbott Consent Decree
Defendants thereunder to and by the GE Consent Decree Defendants and
(z) remove and unconditionally release the Abbott Consent Decree Defendants
as defendants thereunder; and (iv) use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly resolve any objections or conditions asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under the Consent Decree by any Governmental
Authority.

  

(c) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other party of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed communication by
such party to any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the
subject of this Agreement. Neither party to this Agreement shall agree to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of
any filings, investigation or other inquiry related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate at such
meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties to this
Agreement shall coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging
such information and providing such assistance as the other party may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking
early termination of any applicable waiting periods including under the HSR
Act, the EC Merger Regulation and any other applicable Competition/Investment
Laws. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement the parties to this Agreement
shall provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications between them or any of their representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

7.4 _Notifications._ Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other
party in writing of any fact, change, condition, circumstance or occurrence
or nonoccurrence of any event of which it is aware that shall result in (a)
any representation or warranty made by such party to be untrue or inaccurate
in a manner which would result in the failure of the condition set forth in
_Section 10.1(a)_ or _Section 10.2(a)_ and (b) any material failure on such
partys part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it

        

hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 7.4_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

  

7.5 _Release of Indemnity Obligations._

  

(a) Abbott and GE shall cooperate with each other with a view to entering
into arrangements effective as of the Closing whereby GE would be substituted
for Abbott and its Affiliates in any guarantees, letters of comfort,
indemnities or similar arrangements entered into by Abbott or its Affiliates
in respect of the Business (but only to the extent such guarantees, letters
of comfort, indemnities or arrangements constitute Assumed Liabilities). If
GE cannot enter into the arrangements referred to above, Abbott shall not
terminate such guaranty arrangements without GEs consent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that GE shall enter into a separate guaranty with Abbott or one
of its Affiliates to guarantee the performance of the obligations of the
relevant Person pursuant to the Contract underlying such guaranty
arrangements.

  

(b) After the Closing, each of Abbott and GE, at the request of the other
party, shall use, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Consent, substitution or
amendment required to novate or assign all Assumed Liabilities to GE or its
Affiliates and any Excluded Liabilities to Abbott or its Affiliates, and
obtain in writing the unconditional release of Abbott and its Affiliates with
respect to the Assumed Liabilities and the unconditional release of GE and
its Affiliates with respect to the Excluded Liabilities.

  

7.6 _Intellectual Property Matters._

  

(a) At the Closing, Abbott shall grant (to the extent Abbott has a right to)
to GE and its Affiliates, (x) for a period from the Closing until the earlier
of (A) the first anniversary of the Closing or (B) the exhaustion of any
inventory of Abbott Products in existence at the Closing bearing the Licensed
Marks, a non-exclusive, irrevocable (except in the event of breach by GE or
its Affiliates of this _Section 7.6(a)_ , which breach is not cured
within thirty (30) days of written notice from Abbott), non-assignable,
worldwide and royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Marks to
manufacture, label, market, distribute, lease, sell and support inventory of
Abbott Products in existence at the Closing or existing as of the date which
is six (6) months following the Closing, as such Licensed Marks are used in
the Business at the Closing, for the sole purpose of operating the Business
by GE and its Affiliates and (y) a perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable
(except in the event of breach by GE or its Affiliates of this _Section
7.6(a)_ , which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days of written notice
from Abbott), non-assignable, worldwide and royalty-free right and license to
use the Licensed Marks on any installed instrument bases of the Business
existing as of the date which is six (6) months following the Closing, and
only as such Licensed Marks appear on such instruments as of the Closing;
_provided_  that GE, its Affiliates or its designees (i) shall as part of any
resale, refurbishing or receipt of any such installed instrument, and (ii)
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, as part of any service to or
service call on any such installed instrument, cover over all Licensed Marks
so that such Licensed Marks are no longer observable on any exterior surface
of such instrument (but (A) shall have no obligation to alter the operating
software of such instrument to remove the display of any Licensed Mark except
as reasonably

        

practicable when otherwise modifying such software and (B) shall have no
obligation to cover any Licensed Marks to the extent such actions are
objected to by a representative of the applicable customer or end user of
such instrument). The foregoing license grants shall be effective immediately
upon the Closing.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, but
in no event later than six (6) months after the Closing, GE shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, (i) subject to clause (y) of the first sentence of
this _Section 7.6(a)_ , cease to use and remove or cover the name "Abbott" as
a trade name, corporate name or domain name from all materials, and (ii)
otherwise cease use of any Abbott Brand for which GE has not been granted a
license pursuant to this _Section 7.6(a)_ , including removing such Abbott
Brand from signs, billboards, telephone listings, stationery, office forms or
other similar materials of the Business. Any use by GE and its Affiliates of
any Licensed Mark as permitted in this _Section 7.6(a)_ is subject to their
compliance with the level of quality in effect in connection with the
Licensed Marks immediately prior to the Closing Date. GE and its Affiliates
shall not use the Licensed Marks in any manner that reflects negatively on
such Trademarks or on Abbott or its Affiliates, or harms the value or
goodwill of the Licensed Marks;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this sentence shall limit GEs right to take any action with respect to the
Abbott Products to the extent that such action is required by applicable Law.
Except as expressly provided in this  _Section 7.6(a)_ , GE and its
Affiliates shall have no right to use in any way the Licensed Marks. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the Trademarks set forth on _Schedule
7.6(a)_  are used in connection with the Abbott Other Businesses and are
being retained by Abbott and its Affiliates, and Abbott and its Affiliates
shall have the royalty-free right to use such Trademarks and variants thereof
with respect to the products and services of the Abbott Other Businesses and,
subject to any preexisting rights of GE and its Affiliates, other products
and services.

  

(b) Abbott and its Affiliates shall retain the ownership of and other rights
to the Mixed-Use Intellectual Property used primarily in connection with or
related primarily to one or more of the Abbott Other Businesses, which
Intellectual Property is set forth on _Schedule 7.6(b)_ (the " _Abbott Mixed-
Use Intellectual Property_ "). At the Closing, Abbott, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, shall grant (to the extent Abbott has rights to)
to GE and its Affiliates, a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive
and royalty-free right and license (with a right to grant sublicenses or
covenants not to sue for purposes of conducting GEs and its Affiliates
business) ** __** under the Abbott Mixed-Use Intellectual Property to (i)
research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, distribute,
import, support and otherwise dispose of products, methods and services
covered by, and to use, modify, reproduce, display, perform or
prepare derivative works based on, the Abbott Mixed-Use Intellectual Property
in any field of use. The foregoing license grants shall be (i) effective
immediately upon the Closing, and (ii) non-assignable, except in connection
with a transfer of the Business or any other business in which such Abbott
Mixed-Use Intellectual Property is used (or a transfer of substantially all
of the assets of the Business or such other business). Abbott covenants not
to sue GE or its Affiliates for patent infringement to the extent such
infringement is due to making, using, marketing, offer for sale, sale,
importation, or export of products of the Business already marketed as of the
Closing.

  

(c) GE and its Affiliates shall own all right, title and interest in and to
the Mixed-Use Intellectual Property used primarily in connection with or
related primarily to the Business, which Intellectual Property is set forth
on _Schedule 7.6(c)_  (the " _GE Mixed-Use Intellectual Property_ "). At the
Closing, GE, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, shall grant (to

        

the extent GE has rights to) to Abbott and its Affiliates, a
perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive and royalty-free right and
license (with a right to grant sublicenses or covenants not to sue for
purposes of conducting Abbotts and its Affiliates business) under the GE
Mixed-Use Intellectual Property to (i) research, develop, make, have made,
use, sell, offer to sell, distribute, import, support and otherwise dispose
of products, methods and services covered by, and to use, modify, reproduce,
display, perform or prepare derivative works based on, the GE Mixed-Use
Intellectual Property in any field of use. The foregoing license grants shall
be (i) effective immediately upon the Closing, and (ii) non-assignable,
except in connection with a transfer of any business in which such GE Mixed-
Use Intellectual Property is used (or a transfer of substantially all of the
assets of such business). GE covenants not to sue Abbott or its Affiliates
for infringement of Business Intellectual Property to the extent such
infringement is due to making, using, marketing, offer for sale, sale,
importation, or export of products already marketed as of the Closing.

  

(d) GE shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to commence and
prosecute any Action involving the GE Mixed-Use Intellectual Property. In
such case, Abbott agrees to reasonably cooperate with GE (and to the extent
necessary to maintain standing, Abbott agrees to be named as a party in such
suit), at GEs expense, to the extent GE requires information in Abbotts
possession or control or requires other reasonable assistance. ** **In
addition, Abbott shall be entitled to join in any such Action at its own
expense. Abbott shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to
commence and prosecute any Action involving the Abbott Mixed-Use Intellectual
Property. In such case, GE agrees to reasonably cooperate with Abbott (and to
the extent necessary to maintain standing, GE agrees to be named as a party
in such suit), at Abbotts expense, to the extent Abbott requires information
in GEs possession or control or requires other reasonable assistance. In
addition, GE shall be entitled to join in any such Action at its own expense.
If the party having the first right to commence any Action fails to commence
such Action within one hundred eighty (180) days after being notified thereof
by the other party, then the notifying party shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to commence and prosecute any such Action, at the expense of
the notifying party. Any Action that a party undertakes involving the Mixed-
Use Intellectual Property shall not be settled without the prior written
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Each party shall be entitled to retain any and all
amounts awarded to it in any such Action. GE and Abbott shall use reasonable
efforts to keep each other reasonably informed of all settlement negotiations
with third Persons and of the progress of any litigation with third Persons
regarding such Actions.

  

(e) Abbott and GE shall each, at its sole discretion and option and at its
sole expense, pay all maintenance fees, maintain the existence and present
status of any existing registrations for, prosecute all pending applications
for, the Abbott Mixed-Use Intellectual Property and the GE Mixed-Use
Intellectual Property, respectively, and shall maintain the existence and
status, as issued, of any patents issued pursuant to any pending applications
included within its Mixed-Use Intellectual Property; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not require either party to engage in any of the
foregoing or to engage in litigation. If either party: (i) elects not to pay
any applicable maintenance fees, (ii) elects not to prosecute any
applications for registration, or (iii) otherwise fails to maintain any
registration or application for any of its Mixed-Use Intellectual Property,
then it shall provide notice thereof to the other and the other shall then
have, as its sole remedy and at its own expense, the option to

        

pay the fee, or prosecute or maintain the Mixed-Use Intellectual Property
that is the subject of the notice. If either party exercises its option to
prosecute and maintain any Mixed-Use Intellectual Property of the other
pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall notify the other thereof.

  

(f) If the parties identify any patent owned by Abbott that was used
primarily in connection with, or related primarily to, the Business at the
time of Closing, but was not included as Mixed-Use Intellectual Property, the
parties shall amend _Schedule 7.6(c)_ to add such patent. If the parties
identify any patent assigned to GE hereunder that was used primarily in
connection with, or related primarily to, one or more Abbott Other
Business(es) at the time of Closing, the parties shall amend _Schedule
7.6(b)_ to add such patent.

  

7.7 _Transition Services._ Following the Closing, (i) Abbott or one or more
of its Affiliates shall provide or make available to the Business certain
services, rights, properties and assets (to the extent Abbott or one of its
Affiliates has the right to) and (ii) GE or one or more of its
Affiliates shall provide or make available to the Abbott Other Businesses
certain services, rights, properties and assets (to the extent GE or one of
its Affiliates has the right to), in each case on the terms set forth in
a transition services agreement to be entered into at the Closing among
Abbott and, to the extent applicable, its Affiliates, and GE and, to the
extent applicable, its Affiliates (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ "),
with respect to such matters and containing the terms and provisions set
forth on _Schedule 7.7_ and such other terms and provisions with respect to
Annexes A, B and C to _Schedule 7.7_ as the parties shall mutually agree in
writing.

  

7.8 _Further Action._

  

(a) Each of Abbott and GE shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken all appropriate action, to do or cause to be done
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law, the Contracts
included in the Purchased Assets or otherwise, and to execute and deliver
such documents and other papers and any other agreements, as may be necessary
to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to effect the
separation of the Business and the Purchased Assets from other Abbott assets,
including obtaining all required Consents from third Persons. GE shall
be responsible for the payment of any amounts necessary to obtain any
required Consents from third parties. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Abbott and GE shall work diligently and in good faith toward the
execution of the Ancillary Agreements with such terms and conditions required
pursuant hereto and such other terms and conditions as are mutually agreeable
to the parties. If any Ancillary Agreement (other than the Transition
Services Agreement, which shall be executed at the Closing) is not finalized
prior to the Closing, Abbott and GE shall continue to work diligently and in
good faith after the Closing toward the execution of such Ancillary Agreement
as promptly as practicable following the Closing with such terms and
conditions required pursuant hereto and such other terms and conditions as
are mutually agreeable to the parties. Abbott shall, at Abbotts cost,
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Business Intellectual
Property and the GE Mixed-Use Intellectual Property to be free and clear of
liens, pledges, security interests or other similar encumbrances capable of
registration against title at the Closing or as promptly as reasonably
practical thereafter.

        

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign, license, sublicense or
otherwise provide rights with respect to any Purchased Asset or any right
thereunder if an attempted assignment, license or other provision, without
the Consent of, or other action by, any third Person, would constitute a
breach or other contravention of a Contract with such third Person or would
in any way adversely affect the rights of GE or Abbott or any of their
respective Affiliates relating to such Purchased Assets. To the extent that
any of the transfers, distributions, licenses, deliveries and the
assumptions required to be made in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been so consummated at Closing,
the parties shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts,
subject to GEs payment of amounts necessary to obtain Consents, to effect
such consummation as promptly thereafter as reasonably practicable, executing
and delivering such further instruments of transfer and taking such other
actions as the parties may reasonably request in order to effectuate the
purposes of this Agreement or to more effectively transfer to GE or confirm
GEs right, title to or interest in, all of the Purchased Assets, to put GE
in actual possession and operating control thereof and to permit GE to
exercise all rights with respect thereto (including rights under Contracts
and other arrangements as to which the Consent of any third Person to the
transfer thereof shall not have previously been obtained). Except with
respect to the Retained Licenses and Excluded Agreements as set forth on
_Schedule 7.8(b)_ , in the event and to the extent that Abbott and GE are
unable to obtain any required Consents, Abbott shall (i) continue to be
bound thereby pending assignment to GE, (ii) at the direction and expense of
GE, pay, perform and discharge fully all of its obligations thereunder from
and after the Closing and prior to assignment to GE and (iii) without
further consideration therefor, pay, assign and remit to GE promptly all
monies, rights and other consideration received in respect of such
agreements. Also, except for the Retained Licenses and Excluded Agreements as
set forth on _Schedule 7.8(b)_ , Abbott shall exercise or exploit its rights
and options under all such agreements, leases, licenses and other rights and
commitments when and only as reasonably directed by GE. If and when any such
Consent shall be obtained or such agreement, lease, license or other right
shall otherwise become assignable or sublicenseable, Abbott shall promptly
assign or sublicense its agreed-to rights and obligations thereunder to GE
without payment of further consideration and GE shall, without the payment of
any further consideration therefor, assume such rights and obligations.

  

(c) In the event that the parties determine that certain assets, rights or
properties which properly constitute Purchased Assets were not transferred to
GE or one of its Affiliates at Closing, Abbott shall promptly use its
commercially reasonable efforts to transfer and deliver any and all of such
assets to GE or one of its Affiliates without the payment by GE of any
further consideration therefor. In the event that the parties determine that
certain Excluded Assets were transferred to GE or one of its Affiliates at
Closing, then GE shall promptly use its commercially reasonable efforts to
transfer and deliver any and all of such Excluded Assets to Abbott or one of
its Affiliates without the payment by Abbott of any further consideration
therefor. The costs of obtaining any Consents in connection with such
transfer and delivery shall be borne by the recipient of such assets.

  

(d) In the event that the parties determine that a Trademark (other than the
Abbott Brands) is used in the Business and was not transferred to GE pursuant
to _Section 2.1(A)_ or licensed to GE pursuant to _Section 7.6(a)_ or
_Section 7.6(c)_ , Abbott shall, if such Trademark is used primarily in
connection with or primarily related to the Business, assign

        

all right, title and interest in and to such Trademark to GE, and GE, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, shall grant to Abbott a license to use
such Trademark and variants thereof, which license shall have terms
consistent with the terms of the license granted in _Section 7.6(c)_.

  

(e) In the event that the parties determine that a Trademark (other than the
Abbott Brands) is used in any Abbott Humanitarian Program and was transferred
to GE pursuant to _Section 2.1(A)_ , such Trademark shall be licensed to
Abbott and its Affiliates for use in any Abbott Humanitarian Program;
_provided_ that GE would retain all rights to such Trademark for the
Business.

  

7.9 _Mixed Contracts; Mixed Accounts._

  

(a) Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in writing, any Business
Contract (other than any Business Contracts that (A) are used exclusively in
connection with, or relate exclusively to, the Business, (B) expressly
constitute Excluded Assets or (C) to the extent not otherwise covered by
clause (A) and (B), the Retained Licenses and Excluded Agreements) to which
Abbott or any of its Affiliates is a party prior to the Closing, in each
case, that inures to the benefit or burden of each of the Business and the
Abbott Other Businesses (a " _Mixed Contract_ "), shall, to the extent
commercially reasonable, be separated (or, with respect to Intellectual
Property, to the extent not separable and to the extent permitted,
sublicensed) on or after the Closing, so that each of Abbott and GE shall be
entitled to the rights and benefits and shall assume the related portion of
any Liabilities inuring to their respective businesses. If any Mixed Contract
cannot be so separated (or, with respect to Intellectual Property, to the
extent not separable and to the extent permitted, sublicensed), Abbott and GE
shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to, take such
other commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) the rights and benefits
associated with that portion of each Mixed Contract that relates to the
Business to be enjoyed by GE; (ii) the Liabilities associated with that
portion of each Mixed Contract that relates to the Business to be borne by
GE; (iii) the rights and benefits associated with that portion of each Mixed
Contract that relates to the Abbott Other Businesses to be enjoyed by Abbott
and (iv) the Liabilities associated with that portion of each Mixed Contract
that relates to the Abbott Other Businesses to be borne by Abbott. Abbott
shall provide GE with a copy of each Mixed Contract (it being understood that
the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply, where
practicable, with any applicable confidentiality provisions contained in such
Mixed Contracts), and the parties shall cooperate with each other to effect
such separation. The costs of such separation shall be borne by the parties
in proportion to the rights and benefits inuring to each of them under the
Mixed Contract. To the extent GE or its Affiliates, or Abbott or its
Affiliates, exploitation of Intellectual Property sublicensed to such party
under this _Section 7.9(a)_  results in or otherwise contributes to an
obligation by the other party or its Affiliates (as sublicensor under this
_Section 7.9(a)_ ), to make any payments to a third Person, such sublicensee
under this _Section 7.9(a)_  shall be responsible for all such payment
obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Mixed
Contract, Abbott may, in its sole discretion, elect in lieu of the foregoing
arrangements to assign its entire interest in any Mixed Contract to GE
subject to the provisions of _Section 7.8_ and the other terms hereof;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Abbott shall remain primarily liable for, and
shall indemnify the GE Indemnified Parties in respect of, any Liabilities
thereunder to the extent such Liabilities relate to the Excluded Businesses.

  



   

41  

   

(b) Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in writing, the parties
shall not assign any accounts receivable or accounts payable relating to both
the Business and the Excluded Assets (" _Mixed Account_ ").  Abbott and GE
shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to, take such
reasonable and permissible actions to cause (i) the rights and properties
associated with that portion of each Mixed Account that relates to the
Business to be enjoyed by GE; (ii) the Liabilities associated with that
portion of each Mixed Account that relates to the Business to be borne by GE;
(iii) the rights and properties associated with that portion of each Mixed
Account that relates to the Excluded Assets to be enjoyed by Abbott; and (iv)
the Liabilities associated with that portion of each Mixed Account that
relates to the Excluded Assets to be borne by Abbott.

  

7.10 _Third Person Claims Against Both the Business and the Excluded Assets._

  

(a) From and after the Closing: (i) if Abbott or any of its Affiliates
receives notice of any Mixed Action or any Action from or involving any third
Person that Abbott believes is reasonably likely to involve the Business but
as to which neither GE nor any Affiliate of GE is a named party, then Abbott
shall as promptly as practicable provide GE with notice of such Action; and
(ii) if GE or any of its Affiliates receives notice of any Mixed Action or
any Action from or involving any third Person that GE believes is reasonably
likely to involve Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities but as to which
neither Abbott nor any Affiliate of Abbott is a named party, then GE shall as
promptly as practicable provide Abbott with notice of such Action.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Mixed Action_ " means any Action that a
party believes is reasonably likely to: (i) include both claims that give
rise to a right of indemnification under _Article 12_ and claims as to which
no right of indemnification under _Article 12_ exists; or (ii) include both
claims that give rise to a right of indemnification under _Article 12_ of the
GE Indemnified Parties and claims that give rise to a right of
indemnification under _Article 12_ of the Abbott Indemnified Parties.

  

(b) Subject to _Article 12_ , for any Mixed Action, whether arising before or
after the Closing, GE or its Affiliates shall have the right to control the
defense of such Mixed Action to the extent such Mixed Action relates to the
Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, and Abbott or its
Affiliates shall have the right to control the defense of such Mixed Action
to the extent such Mixed Action relates to Excluded Assets or Excluded
Liabilities.

  

(c) Neither GE nor its Affiliates shall settle any portion of a Mixed Action
that relates to Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities without the written
consent of Abbott, which may be withheld in its sole discretion.  Neither
Abbott nor its Affiliates shall settle any portion of a Mixed Action that
relates to the Business without the written consent of GE, which may be
withheld in its sole discretion.  Subject to the provisions of _Article 12_
: (i) GE and its Affiliates may settle a Mixed Action to the extent it
relates to the Business without the consent of Abbott so long as such
judgment or settlement does not adversely impact the Excluded Assets; if it
does adversely impact the Excluded Assets, then the prior written consent of
Abbott shall be required, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; and (ii) Abbott and its Affiliates may settle a Mixed Action to the
extent it relates to Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities without the
consent of GE so long as such judgment or settlement does not

        

adversely impact the Business; if it does adversely impact the Business, then
the prior written consent of GE shall be required, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

(d) To the extent the provisions of this _Section 7.10_ conflict with any
provisions of the Ancillary Agreements, the provisions of the Ancillary
Agreements shall govern.

  

7.11 _Intercompany Arrangements._ Immediately prior to the Closing, Abbott
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, terminate all agreements or
arrangements, written or unwritten, of any kind (other than any Ancillary
Agreements), between Abbott or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
the Abbott Diagnostics Division Business or the Abbott Point of Care
Business, on the other hand.

  

7.12 _Books, Records and Files._ GE and Abbott agree that Abbott may
maintain, subject to _Section 7.2(b)_ , copies of any Books, Records and
Files that are included in the Purchased Assets and that are delivered to GE
hereunder and Abbott may prepare a comprehensive index and file plan of such
Books, Records and Files. GE agrees to retain and maintain such
Books, Records and Files for a period of at least seven (7) years after
Closing (plus any additional time during which GE has been advised by Abbott
that (i) there is an ongoing Tax audit with respect to periods prior to the
Closing or (ii) any such period is otherwise open to assessment; _provided_
that only such Books, Records and Files reasonably related to the appropriate
Tax audit or period as advised by Abbott shall be subject to such time
extension). During such period, GE agrees to give Abbott and its
representatives reasonable cooperation, access (including copies) and staff
assistance, as needed, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, with respect to the Books, Records and Files delivered to
GE hereunder, and Abbott agrees to give GE and its representatives reasonable
cooperation, access and staff assistance, as needed, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, with respect to the Books, Records and
Files relating to the Business and retained by Abbott, in each case as may be
necessary for general business purposes, including the defense of litigation,
the preparation of Tax returns and financial statements (including the
Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and Closing Date Balance Sheet) and
the management and handling of Tax audits; _provided_ that such cooperation,
access and assistance does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of
GE or Abbott or their respective Affiliates.

  

7.13 _Non-Compete_. Other than with respect to (i) the Abbott Diabetes Care
Business and the Abbott Molecular Diagnostics Business, or (ii) Abbotts or
its Affiliates support of the Business pursuant to the terms of
the Transition Services Agreement or their conduct of portions of the
Business pursuant to any Deferred Local Closing, the Delayed PR Closing or
the arrangements described on Schedule 7.8(b), for a period of five (5) years
from the Closing, Abbott shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, engage in any business anywhere in the world that
competes with all or any portion of the Business as of the Closing Date;
_provided_  that, Abbott and its Affiliates shall not be deemed to be
competing in violation of this _Section 7.13_ by virtue of (i) its or their
ownership of less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of any
Person, (ii) the acquisition of a business or entity that competes as
contemplated by the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.13_ ; _provided_
, that (i) such acquired business or entity shall not be permitted to use any
GE Mixed-Use Intellectual Property and (ii) (A) the annual net sales of the
portion of the business or entity that so competes do not exceed

        

twenty percent (20%) of the annual net sales of the entire acquired business
or entity as reported in the most recent full year financial statements of
such business or entity or (B) the annual net sales of the portion of the
business or entity that so competes do not exceed $25,000,000 for the most
recently completed fiscal year of such business or entity prior to the
acquisition or (iii) participating in any Abbott Humanitarian Program. In
consideration of the exception to the non-competition provisions contained in
_clause (iii)_  of this _Section 7.13_ , the parties agree that Abbott shall
provide GE for the term of the non-compete contained in this _Section 7.13_
with a good faith right of first negotiation to be the provider of any human
diagnostic or point of care products that are manufactured or sold by the
Business at such time (other than any products that are manufactured or sold
by the Abbott Other Businesses or any products that are manufactured or sold
by any business or entity permitted to be acquired pursuant to the proviso of
this _Section 7.13_ ) supplied by Abbott through any Abbott Humanitarian
Program.

  

7.14 _Environmental Matters._

  

(a) _Environmental Assessment_.

  

(i) GE (at its sole cost) may retain an environmental consulting firm
acceptable to Abbott (whose acceptance shall not unreasonably be withheld) to
undertake an environmental review of the Owned Business Real Property or any
of the Leased Business Real Property. At GEs discretion, such review shall
generally be consistent with the scope of a Phase I Environmental Assessment
in accordance with ASTM E1527-05. As soon as practicable after the date
hereof, GE shall have access to any of the Owned Business Real Property or
Leased Business Real Property and related personnel and records to undertake
such environmental review (the earlier of (i) the date that such on-site
access is first secured by GE or (ii) the fifth day following the date hereof
shall be the " _Environmental Review Commencement Date_ "). Such
environmental consulting firm shall prepare an executive summary chart or
other written summary for each property assessed which identifies any
environmental condition that constitutes a recognized environmental condition
according to the ASTM E1527-05 standard, or otherwise represents a Liability
under Environmental Laws (collectively, " _Environmental Conditions_ "), and
GE shall provide Abbott with copies of each such written summary ("
_Environmental Summaries_ ").

  

(ii) If one or more Environmental Conditions for which cleanup or correction
is required under any Environmental Law are identified in any
Environmental Summary prepared in accordance with clause (a)(i) above and
provided to Abbott within thirty (30) days of the Environmental Review
Commencement Date, and such Environmental Condition, if confirmed (including
pursuant to Phase II work pursuant to _Section 7.14(a)(iii)_ below), would
result in any of the representations and warranties in _Section 5.4_ to be
inaccurate or breached (considered for purposes of this _Section 7.14_
disregarding any qualification or exception contained in any such
representation or warranty relating to Knowledge, materiality or Material
Adverse Effect), GE may, at its election, subject to any necessary
confirmation pursuant to ­ _Section 7.14(a)(iii)_ below: (1) require Abbott
to perform a cleanup or correction, subject to the conditions and limitations
set forth in clause (b) below, (2) not take ownership of the property, if
such property is Owned Business Real Property, or lease of the property if
such property is Leased Business Real Property, in which case such property
shall be leased, in the case of Owned Business Real Property, or to the
extent permitted, sub-leased, in the case of Leased

        

Business Real Property, from Abbott pursuant to a lease or sub-lease
containing the terms and provisions set forth on _Schedule 7.14(a)(ii)_ and
such other terms and provisions as the parties shall mutually agree in
writing, or (3) submit a GE claim for such inaccuracies or breaches as
provided in _Section 12.2(a)(iv)_. If no Environmental Conditions
requiring cleanup or correction under Environmental Laws are identified
within thirty (30) days of the Environmental Review Commencement Date, then
Abbott shall have no liability or obligation to GE pursuant to this _Section
7.14_ or _Section 12.2(a)(iv)_ and all Owned Business Real Property and
Leased Business Real Property shall be transferred to GE. GE shall reimburse
Abbott for its necessary out-of-pocket costs of response (" _Response Costs_
") that Abbott incurs arising out of any cleanup or correction of an
Environmental Condition undertaken by Abbott pursuant to _Section
7.14(a)(ii)(1)_ or any Response Costs that Abbott incurs for cleanup or
correction of an Environmental Condition required by GE, any Governmental
Authority or applicable Environmental Law with respect to property retained
by Abbott pursuant to _Section 7.14(a)(ii)(2)_  and leased pursuant to
Alternative "A" described in _Schedule 7.14(a)(ii)_  up to the first
$100,000,000 of Response Costs less the amount of all other GE Claims for
indemnification prior thereto pursuant to _Sections 12.2(a)(v)_  and _(vi)_
without regard to the limitation on recovery for the first $100,000,000 of
such claims contained therein and then for Response Costs to the extent such
Response Costs, plus the amount of all other GE Claims for indemnification
paid pursuant to _Sections 12.2(a)(v)_ and _(vi),_  exceed $700,000,000.

  

(iii) As soon as practicable after receipt by Abbott of the Environmental
Summaries referred to above and prior to the Closing Date, GE (at its sole
cost) may retain an environmental consulting firm acceptable to Abbott (whose
acceptance shall not unreasonably be withheld) to conduct a Phase II
Environmental Assessment, the scope of which (1) shall be reasonably limited
to investigation and confirmation of the specific Environmental Conditions
identified in the Environmental Summaries, and (2) propose sampling locations
and times reasonably acceptable to Abbott (which approval shall not
unreasonably be withheld if reasonably warranted as a result of GEs
preliminary environmental review). In no event shall Abbotts review and
approval unreasonably delay or constrain GEs ability to perform
any confirmation reasonably required to secure the benefits of
_Section 7.14(a)(ii)_ above.

  

(iv) Nothing in this _Section 7.14_ shall be in limitation of GEs right of
access pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ to evaluate environmental matters
relating to the Business and the Purchased Assets even after the thirty (30)
day period provided for in _Section 7.14(a)(ii)_ has expired; _provided_
that, except as provided in this _Section 7.14_ but without limiting
any provision of _Section 10.2_ , Abbott shall have no further obligations
with respect to any actual or contingent Environmental Conditions identified
in any Phase I or Phase II Environmental Assessment prepared pursuant to
_Section 7.14(a)(i)_ or _(iii)_ above.

  

(b) _Environmental Procedures_.

  

(i) Subject to the limitations set forth in clause (b)(ii) below and subject
to any reimbursement obligations of GE pursuant to clause (a)(ii) above,
Abbott shall assume sole responsibility for performing and for the necessary
Response Costs of performing any cleanup or correction that is required by
Environmental Law to address the Environmental Conditions identified in any
Phase I or Phase II Environmental Assessment prepared pursuant to clause
(a)(i) or (iii) above to the extent GE has so elected pursuant to _Section
7.14(a)(ii)(1)_ above.

        

GE shall grant Abbott, its representatives and contractors reasonable access
to the applicable Owned Business Real Property or Leased Business Real
Property (to the extent permitted by the applicable lease) to perform any
such cleanup or correction and Abbott shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to restore any adversely affected portion of the property. Abbott
shall keep GE reasonably apprised of the status of such environmental cleanup
or correction, shall provide GE with copies of any material correspondence
and reports relating thereto and shall not engage in exchanges of material
information or negotiations with any Governmental Authority without
exercising reasonable best efforts to first consult with GE.

  

(ii) With respect to Abbotts cleanup obligations under clause (b)(i) above,
Abbott shall only be required to: (x) clean up the release of Hazardous
Materials, to the extent cleanup is required by an applicable Environmental
Law that is in effect and is enforceable as of the Closing Date; (y) achieve
the least stringent Remediation Standards that are applicable and acceptable
to the relevant Governmental Authority given the use of the Owned Business
Real Property or Leased Business Real Property as of the Closing Date; and
(z) conduct a cleanup using the most cost effective methods for
investigation, removal, remediation and/or containment consistent with
applicable Environmental Law that do not unduly interfere with GEs ability
to continue to use the affected property in a manner consistent with Abbotts
prior use.

  

7.15 _Puerto Rico._

  

(a) From the Closing or the Delayed PR Closing Date (as defined below), if
applicable, until March 1, 2009 (the " _PR Employment Commitment Period_ "),
GE and its Affiliates shall employ in Puerto Rico, with respect to the
portion of the Business conducted in Puerto Rico that is being acquired by GE
and its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Puerto Rico Business_
"), at least the number of Non-U.S. Transferred Employees dedicated to the
Puerto Rico Business ( _"PR Employees_ "), subject to reduction as set forth
in _Schedule 7.15(a)_ (the " _PR Employment Commitment_ "). GE shall notify
Abbott in the event that any PR Employee voluntarily terminates employment or
is terminated for cause, if possible, seven (7) days prior to the employees
termination date and in all events, promptly after the date of termination.
GE and its Affiliates shall be deemed to satisfy the PR Employment Commitment
with respect to any employee of the Puerto Rico Business who voluntarily
terminates employment or is terminated for cause; _provided_ _however_ , GE
or any of its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to hire a
replacement employee in Puerto Rico (" _Replacement Employee_ ") as soon as
is commercially practical after the date of termination of the PR Employee.
GE shall notify Abbott when any Replacement Employee is hired.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Puerto Rico Business suffers any
change, effect, occurrence, state of facts or development that individually or
in the aggregate is materially adverse to the business, financial condition
or results of operations of the Puerto Rico Business, taken as a whole, and,
in response to such change, effect, occurrence, state of facts or
development, GE or any of its Affiliates intends to reduce the number of
employees that are employed in the Puerto Rico Business below the then-
current PR Employment Commitment, GE shall be entitled to reduce the number
of employees accordingly so long as GE notifies Abbott at least thirty (30)
days prior to terminating any such PR Employees (in which case Abbott shall
have the option of hiring any such employees). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement or the PR Deferred Closing Amendment (as defined below) to the
contrary, the sole remedy of Abbott and its Affiliates for

        

breach by GE or its Affiliates of this _Section 7.15(a)_ shall be the
Losses incurred by Abbott or any of its Affiliates to employ sufficient
persons in Puerto Rico to satisfy any shortfall in the PR Employment
Commitment, and in no event shall GE or any of its Affiliates be liable for
any increased Taxes of Abbott or its Affiliates attributable to failure to
satisfy the terms of the Puerto Rico Grant.

  

(b) GE shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Abbott, at Abbotts expense, in Abbotts efforts to obtain an amendment to
the Puerto Rico Grant in a form reasonably acceptable to Abbott (the " _PR
Amendment_ ") reflecting the terms set forth in _Schedule 7.15(b)_ ;
_provided_ , however, that GE shall not be required to (i) pay any fees or
other payments to any Governmental Authorities in connection with such
cooperation; (ii) except as provided in _Section 7.16(a)_ , alter or restrict
in any way the business or commercial practices of GE, any of its Affiliates
or the Business, including the Puerto Rico Business; or (iii) take any action
that would preclude GE from taking into account any PR Employees in its own
grant with Puerto Rico.

  

(c) Promptly after the date hereof, Abbott and GE shall negotiate in good
faith to enter into agreements (the " _PR Deferred Closing Agreements_ "),
which agreements shall effect the delay of the closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby in respect of the Puerto Rico Business (the " _Delayed PR
Closing_ ") until the earlier of (i) three (3) Business Days after the PR
Amendment is obtained or (ii) December 31, 2007 (any such date referred to as
the " _Delayed PR Closing Date_ "). The parties hereto shall make available
to each other and, if necessary to comply with the provisions of _Section
7.15(c)(i)_ , Ernst and Young LLP such books, records and other information as
any of the foregoing may reasonably request to prepared the PR Deferred
Closing Agreements, in the case of Abbott and GE, and to determine the terms
necessary to effect the provisions of _Section 7.15(c)(i)_ , in the case of
Ernst and Young LLP. The PR Deferred Closing Agreements shall include
provisions providing for:

  

(i) any Delayed PR Closing to be economically neutral to GE and its
Affiliates as if the Puerto Rico Business had been transferred to GE and its
Affiliates at Closing, including in respect of the operating margin and net
income of GE and its Affiliates in respect of the Puerto Rico Business for
the period from the Closing to the Delayed PR Closing;

  

(ii) Abbott or one of its Affiliates to retain ownership of the Purchased
Assets and Assumed Liabilities related to the PR Business;

  

(iii) a form of contract manufacturing agreement to be entered into between
Abbott or any of its Affiliates and GE or any of its Affiliates whereby
Abbott or one of its Affiliates shall perform manufacturing services
specified by GE until the earlier of the Delayed PR Closing Date or
termination of such contract manufacturing agreement, which agreement shall
include the pricing and other terms upon which Abbott or one of its
Affiliates shall provide such services as agreed to by Abbott and GE;

  

(iv) covenants governing the operation by Abbott and its Affiliates of the
Puerto Rico Business between the Closing and any Delayed PR Closing;

        

(v) the conditions to the obligations of each of Abbott and GE to effect the
Delayed PR Closing;

  

(vi) indemnification by Abbott of the GE Indemnified Parties in respect of
any and all Losses which GE and its Affiliates may actually suffer or incur
as a result of the Delayed PR Closing (other than those Losses which GE and
its Affiliates may have already recovered by means of arrangements provided
in the PR Deferred Closing Agreements), including any Losses in respect of
any failure of Abbott and its Affiliates to deliver the Puerto Rico Business
and the Purchased Assets related thereto to GE or any of its Affiliates at
the Delayed PR Closing, which indemnification shall be treated as an
indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)(iii)_ and as to which _Section
12.5(a)_ shall not apply; _provided_ , that GE shall permit Abbott or an
independent accounting firm selected by Abbott, subject to GEs reasonable
objection, to audit the books and records of account of GE upon reasonable
notice during reasonable business hours to confirm any Losses claimed by GE
pursuant to this _Section 7.15(c)(vi)_ ;

  

(vii) indemnification by Abbott of the GE Indemnified Parties in respect of
the Tax benefits GE and its Affiliates would have realized had the
transactions contemplated hereby in respect of the Puerto Rico Business been
effected in connection with the Closing, which Losses Abbott and GE agree
shall be $833,333 for each month between the Closing and the Delayed PR
Closing Date or, in the case of a partial month, the pro-rated amount of such
monthly agreed upon Loss;

  

(viii) Abbott to insure for the benefit of GE and its Affiliates the Puerto
Rico Business and the Purchased Assets related thereto consistent with
Abbotts practices; and

  

(ix) such other provisions as the parties shall mutually agree.

  

Unless Abbott shall have notified GE that it does not wish to effect
a Delayed PR Closing by March 12, 2007, if the parties shall have not agreed
upon the terms of the PR Deferred Closing Agreements described in
_Section 7.15(c)(i)_ by such date, terms necessary to effect the provisions
of _Section 7.15(c)(i)_ shall be determined by Ernst and Young LLP. At the
request of either party, Ernst and Young LLP shall make its determination by
March 26, 2007 and issue a written report thereof, which report shall be
attached to the PR Deferred Closing Agreements and incorporated by reference
therein as a binding agreement of Abbott and GE. Each of Abbott and GE shall
be afforded the opportunity to provide one (1) written and one (1)
oral submission to Ernst and Young LLP.

  

(d) Unless Abbott notifies GE on or prior to March 28, 2007 that it does not
wish to effect a Delayed PR Closing, the provisions of the PR Deferred
Closing Agreements shall become effective upon the Closing and the closing of
the transactions contemplated hereby in respect of the Puerto Rico Business
shall be delayed until the Delayed PR Closing Date.

        

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any conflict between the provisions of
this _Section 7.15_  and _Article 8_ shall be resolved in favor of _Article
8_. Failure of Abbott and GE to agree to terms of the PR Deferred Closing
Agreements or failure of Ernst and Young LLP to issue the report contemplated
by _Section 7.15(c)_ by Closing shall not, in the absence of bad faith,
constitute a basis for either party not to effect the Closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in respect of the
Puerto Rico Business.

  

7.16 _Certain Leased and Real Property Sites._ Between signing and
Closing the parties shall work in good faith to determine whether the leased
and real property sites listed on _Schedule 7.16_ shall be deemed to be
Leased Business Real Property, Owned Business Real Property or retained by
Abbott; _provided_ , that if the parties cannot agree whether such leased and
real property sites should be deemed to be Leased Business Real Property,
Owned Business Real Property or should be retained by Abbott, any property
sites listed on _Schedule 7.16_  that are used primarily in connection with,
or primarily related to, the Business shall be deemed to be Leased Business
Real Property or Owned Business Real Property, as applicable, and any other
property sites listed on _Schedule 7.16_ shall be retained by Abbott.  Any
site so designated as Leased Business Real Property or Owned Business Real
Property shall be added to _Schedule 1.1(i)_ or _Schedule 1.1(l)_ , as
applicable. For purposes of this Agreement, the Environmental Review
Commencement Date with respect to any property site listed on _Schedule 7.16_
and determined by Abbott and GE to be Leased Business Real Property or Owned
Business Real Property shall be the fifth day following the date of such
determination.

  

 **ARTICLE 8**

  

 **EMPLOYEE MATTERS**

  

8.1 _Transferred Employees._

  

(a) _Definitions_.

  

(i) " _U.S. Business Employee_ " means (A) any employee of the Business
employed by an employer domiciled in the United States (or an employee who is
classified as an expatriate employee) who (except as otherwise agreed to in
writing by GE and Abbott) primarily performs his or her services for or with
respect to the Business in the United States as of the Closing, and (B) any
individual who is a shared service employee primarily dedicated to the
Business in the United States as of the Closing, including in all cases any
such employee who is inactive because of leave of absence, vacation, holiday
or short- or long-term disability, but excluding employees set forth on
_Schedule 8.1(a)(i)  1_. _Schedule 8.1(a)(i)  2_ sets forth the procedures
for identifying all U.S. Business Employees prior to Closing. _Schedule
8.1(a)(i)  1_ and _Schedule 8.1(a)(i)  2_ are attached. A preliminary list
of all U.S. Business Employees shall be provided by Abbott to GE as soon as
reasonably practicable, and in no event later than thirty (30) days after the
signing of this Agreement, which such list shall be updated and finalized at
Closing.

        

(ii) " _U.S. Transferred Employee_ " means each U.S. Business Employee who
shall commence employment with GE or one of its Affiliates immediately
following the Closing, but excluding any U.S. Business Employee who is absent
from active employment as of the Closing due to long-term disability
entitling the U.S. Business Employee to long-term disability benefits under
an applicable long-term disability plan maintained by Abbott or any of its
Affiliates.

  

(iii) " _Non-U.S. Business Employee_ " means (A) any employee of the Business

service employee primarily dedicated to the Business outside of the United
States as of the Closing, including in all cases any such employee who is
inactive because of leave of absence, vacation, holiday or short- or long-
term disability. _Schedule 8.1(a)(iii)_ sets forth the procedures for
identifying all Non-U.S. Business Employees prior to Closing. _Schedule
8.1(a)(iii)_ is attached. A preliminary list of all Non-U.S. Business
Employees shall be provided by Abbott to GE as soon as
reasonably practicable, and in no event later than thirty (30) days after the
signing of this Agreement, which such list shall be updated and finalized at
Closing.

  

(iv) " _Non-U.S. Transferred Employee_ " means (A) each Non-U.S. Business
Employee whose employment transfers to GE or one of its Affiliates by
operation of Law, but expressly excluding any person who refuses to transfer
to GE or one of its Affiliates on or before the Closing and who, by that
refusal, prevents such transfer from occurring by operation of Law, and (B)
each other Non-U.S. Business Employee who shall accept GEs offer of
employment by continuing employment with GE or one of its Affiliates
immediately following the Closing, but excluding for this clause (B) any
Non-U.S. Business Employee who is absent from active employment as of the
Closing due to long-term disability entitling the Non-U.S. Business Employee
to long-term disability benefits under an applicable long-term disability
plan maintained by Abbott or any of its Affiliates.

Business Employees, collectively.

  

(vi) " _Transferred Employees_ " means U.S. Transferred Employees and
Non-U.S. Transferred Employees, collectively.

  

(b) _Transfer of Employment_. As of the Closing, GE shall commence to
employ, or cause the applicable Affiliate to commence to employ, any U.S.
Business Employees. As of the Closing, in respect of any Non-U.S. Business
Employee whose employment shall not transfer automatically by operation of
Law, GE shall, or shall cause the applicable Affiliate to, commence to employ
such Non-U.S. Business Employee. The foregoing provisions of this _Section
8.1(b)_ shall not be applicable with respect to any Business Employee who is
absent from active employment as of the Closing due to long-term disability
entitling the

        

Business Employee to long-term disability benefits under an applicable long-
term disability plan maintained by Abbott or any of its Affiliates.

  

8.2 _Compensation and Employee Benefits._

  

(a) _Compensation and Benefits Comparability_. For a period of two (2) years
following the Closing, Transferred Employees who remain in the employment of
GE or any of its Affiliates shall receive (i) base salary or wage rates and
incentive compensation opportunity that, in the aggregate, are not less than
those in effect for each such Transferred Employee immediately prior to
Closing, (ii) employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are reasonably
comparable to those in effect for similarly situated recently acquired
employees of GE and (iii) severance benefits which are no less favorable on
an individual basis than the severance benefits that would have been
applicable to each such Transferred Employee under the Abbott or
Abbott Affiliate severance plans or individual agreements to the extent set
forth on _Schedule 8.2(a)_ (which Abbott shall provide GE as soon as
reasonably practicable, and in no event later than sixty (60) days after the
signing of this Agreement and _Schedule 8.2(a)_ shall exclude any plan or
agreement mandated by and maintained solely pursuant to applicable Law),
immediately prior to the Closing, as the case may be, taking into account
such Transferred Employees additional period of service and rate of base pay
or wages and bonus target with GE or its Affiliates following the Closing.
Except as required by Law, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
construed as requiring GE or one of its Affiliates to continue the employment
of any specific person.

  

(b) _Severance Liabilities_. GE and its Affiliates shall be solely
responsible for any severance, redundancy or similar termination payments or
benefits that may become payable to any Transferred Employee on or after the
Closing, and GE shall indemnify Abbott and its Affiliates from any and all
Liabilities for such payments and benefits and shall reimburse Abbott as set
forth below.  To the extent that Abbott or any of its Affiliates become
liable for, or are legally required to make, severance, redundancy or similar
termination payments or benefits to any Transferred Employee on or after the
Closing, GE shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, reimburse Abbott, as
soon as practicable but in any event within thirty (30) days of receipt from
Abbott of appropriate verification, for all payments, costs and expenses
actually paid by Abbott or its Affiliates as required by applicable Law or
any Contract. Abbott and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for any
severance, change in control, redundancy or similar termination payments or
benefits that may become payable to any Business Employee who does not become
a Transferred Employee, and Abbott shall indemnify GE and its Affiliates from
any and all Liabilities for such payments and benefits and shall reimburse GE
as set forth below. To the extent that GE or any of its Affiliates become
liable for, or are legally required to make, severance, change in control,
redundancy or similar termination payments or benefits to any Business
Employee who does not become a Transferred Employee, Abbott shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, reimburse GE, as soon as practicable but in any
event within thirty (30) days of receipt from GE of appropriate verification,
for all payments, costs and expenses actually paid by GE or its Affiliates as
required by applicable Law or any Contract.

  

(c) _Service Credit_. GE shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, recognize
the prior service and seniority of each Transferred Employee as if such
service had been performed with, and such seniority has been earned with, GE
for purposes of eligibility,

        

vesting and service related level of benefits (excluding pension benefit
accrual, except as required by Law or pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ ) under
the employee benefit plans and policies provided by GE to the Transferred
Employees following the Closing, to the same extent such service and
seniority is recognized by Abbott or its Affiliates immediately prior to the
Closing.

  

(d) _Welfare Plans_. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, (i)
Abbott or one of its Affiliates shall retain responsibility under the Abbott
"employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA,
whether or not such plan is subject to ERISA) in which the Transferred
Employees participate with respect to all welfare benefit claims incurred by
the Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents prior to the Closing
and (ii) GE or one of its Affiliates shall be responsible for all welfare
benefit claims incurred by Transferred Employees and their eligible
dependents on or after the Closing. **** With respect to any "employee welfare
benefit plan" maintained by GE or any of its Affiliates in which Transferred
Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing, GE shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, (A) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such Transferred Employees to the extent such
conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such Transferred
Employees under the welfare benefit plans maintained by Abbott or any of its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing and (B) provide each Transferred
Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid by such
Transferred Employee in the plan year in which the Closing occurs prior to
the Closing in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan. Effective as of
the Closing, GE and its Affiliates shall assume all obligations for providing
coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended, to Transferred Employees (and their eligible dependents), regardless
of whether the qualifying event giving rise to that coverage occurred prior
to, on or after the Closing.

  

(e) _Labor and Employment Law Matters_. GE and Abbott shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates to, cooperate to take all steps, on a timely basis, as are
required under applicable Law to notify, consult with, or negotiate the
effect, impact, terms or timing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with each works council, union, labor board, employee group, or
Governmental Authority where so required under applicable Law. GE and Abbott
shall, and shall cause their applicable Affiliates to, comply with all
applicable Laws, directives and regulations relating to the Transferred
Employees, including providing any required notice under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, as amended, and any similar
foreign, state or local law.

  

(f) _Incentive Compensation_. GE shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
continue each performance period in effect at the Closing under each
incentive compensation bonus plan in which any Transferred Employee
participates, with appropriate adjustment (as determined by Abbott and GE in
good faith) to the applicable performance targets to take into account the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. GE shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, make such bonus payments at the time prescribed by the
applicable plan as in effect immediately prior to the Closing and in
accordance with the historical past practices under such plan as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing. In no event shall the aggregate amount of
bonus paid with respect to such performance periods be less than the amount
accrued for and reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheets.

  



   

52  

   

(g) _Flexible Spending Account_. Effective as of the Closing, GE and its
Affiliates shall have in effect flexible spending reimbursement accounts
under a cafeteria plan qualifying under Section 125 of the Code (the " _GE
FSA Plan_ ") and each U.S. Transferred Employee shall be eligible as of the
Closing to participate in a GE FSA Plan pursuant to the terms of such plan.
Effective as of the Closing, GE and its Affiliates shall cause the GE FSA
Plan to accept a spin-off of the health care flexible spending reimbursement
accounts of each U.S. Transferred Employee who participates in the Abbott or
Abbott Affiliate cafeteria plan (the " _Abbott FSA Plan_ ") immediately prior
to the Closing and to honor and continue through December 31 of the year in
which the Closing occurs the elections made by each U.S. Transferred Employee
under the Abbott FSA Plan in respect of such health care flexible spending
reimbursement accounts that are in effect immediately prior to the Closing.
As soon as practicable following the date of Closing, Abbott shall cause to
be transferred from the Abbott FSA Plan to the GE FSA Plan the excess, if
any, of the aggregate accumulated contributions to the health care flexible
spending reimbursement accounts made by U.S. Transferred Employees prior to
the Closing during the year in which the Closing occurs over the aggregate
reimbursement payouts paid to the Transferred Employees for such year from
such accounts.  From and after the Closing, GE shall assume and be solely
responsible for all claims by U.S. Transferred Employees under the Abbott FSA
Plans health care flexible spending reimbursement accounts incurred at any
time during the calendar year in which the date of Closing occurs, whether
incurred prior to, on or after the date of Closing, that have not been paid
in full as of the date of Closing. Abbott shall maintain and continue to
process claims related to the 2006 plan year for such Abbott FSA Plan in
accordance with the plan terms. For Transferred Employees located in Puerto
Rico who are receiving comparable flexible spending reimbursement account
benefits, Abbott and GE shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect a
similar transfer of assets for such benefits.

  

8.3 _U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plans_. Effective as of the Closing, GE
shall establish or designate defined benefit pension plans that are intended
to be qualified under Code Section 401(a) (collectively, the " _U.S. GE
Pension Plans_ ") for the benefit of the U.S. Transferred Employees. Each
U.S. Transferred Employee as of the Closing shall be a participant in a U.S.
GE Pension Plan pursuant to the terms of such plan; _provided_ , that
such participant makes contributions required in order to participate in the
U.S. GE Pension Plan.

  

8.4 _Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plans_.

  

(a) Effective as of the Closing, GE shall establish or designate defined
benefit pension plans (collectively, the " _Non-U.S. GE Pension Plans_ ") for
the benefit of the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees who participated in one or
more of the defined benefit pension plans maintained by Abbott or its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing (collectively, the " _Abbott
Pension Plans_ "). Such Non-U.S. Transferred Employees are referred to
hereinafter as the " _Pension Plan Employees_." Each Non-U.S. GE Pension Plan
shall provide benefit formulas and provisions that are equivalent in value to
the benefit plan formulas and provisions in the corresponding Abbott Pension
Plan as of the Closing and GE shall either continue such Non-U.S. GE Pension
Plan on the same basis, or offer comparable retirement benefits (with no
reduction, in either case, in employer-paid value, based on comparability
standards used by nationally recognized benefits consulting firms) to the
Pension Plan Employees, for a period of at least two years immediately
following the Closing. The Pension

        

Plan Employees shall be given credit under the respective Non-U.S. GE Pension
Plan for all service with and compensation from Abbott or its Affiliates as
if it were service with and compensation from GE for purposes of determining
eligibility, vesting and the amount of any benefits or benefit accruals under
each respective Non-U.S. GE Pension Plan. Each Non-U.S. GE Pension Plan shall
provide, upon the transfer of assets referred to below (or, if there is no
transfer of assets with respect to a particular plan because the plan is not
required to be funded under applicable Law, as of the Closing), that the
accrued benefits for the Pension Plan Employees under such Non-U.S. GE
Pension Plan shall in no event be less than their accrued benefits under the
corresponding Abbott Pension Plan as of the Closing.

  

(b) With respect to any Abbott Pension Plan maintained outside of the United
States (other than any Abbott Pension Plan maintained in the United Kingdom),
Abbott shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be transferred
from the trusts under such Abbott Pension Plan to the trusts under the
corresponding Non-U.S. GE Pension Plan assets in the form of cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities, the value of which shall be equal to:
(i) the actuarial present value of accrued (and not projected) benefits (that
is, the "accumulated benefit obligation" as defined in Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 87, "ABO") under such Abbott Pension Plan as of the
date of Closing that are attributable to Pension Plan Employees divided by
the ABO of all participants in such Abbott Pension Plan as of the date of
Closing, multiplied by the market value of the assets of such Abbott Pension
Plan at the date of Closing,  _provided_ that such transferred amount shall
not, in any event, exceed the ABO under such Abbott Pension Plan of all
Pension Plan Employees as of the date of Closing, or (ii) such greater amount
as is required by the applicable regulatory authority having jurisdiction
over the Abbott Pension Plan in order to obtain approval for the transfer.
 With respect to any Abbott Pension Plan maintained in the United Kingdom,
Abbott shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be transferred
from the trusts under such Abbott Pension Plan to the trusts under the
corresponding Non-U.S. GE Pension Plan assets in the form of cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities, the value of which shall be equal
to the actuarial present value of projected benefits (that is, the "projected
benefit obligation" as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 87, "PBO") under such Abbott Pension Plan as of the date of Closing that
are attributable to Pension Plan Employees divided by the PBO of all
participants in such Abbott Pension Plan as of the date of Closing,
multiplied by the market value of the assets of such Abbott Pension Plan at
the date of Closing, _provided_ that such transferred amount shall not, in
any event, exceed the PBO under such Abbott Pension Plan of all Pension Plan
Employees as of the date of Closing. The amounts determined in accordance
with the preceding sentences of this _Section 8.4(b)_ are collectively
referred to as the " _Pension Transfer Amounts_ ". The transfer of the Pension
Transfer Amounts, and the assumption by GE of Liabilities with respect to or
relating to the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees under the applicable Abbott
Pension Plans, shall be subject to such consents, approvals and other legal
requirements as may apply under applicable Law, including the consent of the
Non-U.S. Transferred Employee to the extent required by applicable Law. GE
shall use its best efforts to cause the corresponding Non-U.S. GE Pension
Plans to accept the Pension Transfer Amounts. To the extent the trustees
or managers of an Abbott Pension Plan do not transfer the Pension Transfer
Amount calculated with respect to that plan (as adjusted in accordance with
_Section 8.4(d)_ below), Abbott shall or shall cause the difference between
the Pension Transfer Amount (as adjusted in accordance with _Section 8.4(d)_
 below) and the amount actually transferred to be paid to GE, or to such
other Person or plan as GE shall direct, no later than thirty (30) days after
Abbotts receipt of

        

notification from the trustees or managers of the amount that they have
transferred. To the extent an Abbott Pension Plan is not required to be
funded by applicable Law, there shall be no transfer of assets by the Abbott
Pension Plan or Abbott.  Actuarial determinations shall be made in accordance
with _Section 8.4(g)_ below.

  

(c) As of the date of Closing, Abbott shall cause the Non-U.S. Transferred
Employees to cease further accrual of benefits under the Abbott Pension
Plans.

  

(d) The Pension Transfer Amount, if any, from each Abbott Pension Plan shall
be equitably adjusted to take into account benefit payments made from the
Abbott Pension Plans to the Pension Plan Employees after the Closing but
prior to the date of transfer and for any earnings and losses on such amount
during such period. The Pension Transfer Amount, if any, shall be determined
by the actuaries for the applicable Abbott Pension Plans in accordance with
_Section 8.4(g)_ below.

  

(e) Subject to such consents, approvals and other legal requirements as may
apply under applicable Law, Abbott shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the transfer of the Pension Transfer Amounts to take place within
one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date of Closing.

  

(f) At the times of the transfers of the Pension Transfer Amounts (or if
there is no transfer of assets with respect to a particular plan because the
plan is not required to be funded under applicable Law, at the Closing), GE
and the Non-U.S. GE Pension Plans shall assume all Liabilities for all
accrued benefits, including all disability, part-time and other ancillary
benefits, under the corresponding Abbott Pension Plans in respect of the
Non-U.S. Transferred Employees whose benefits are transferred, and Abbott and
its Affiliates and the corresponding Abbott Pension Plans shall be relieved
of all Liabilities to provide benefits under the Abbott Pension Plans to the
Non-U.S. Transferred Employees whose benefits are transferred. From and
after the date of such applicable transfer of the Pension Transfer Amounts
(or if there is no transfer of assets with respect to a particular plan
because the plan is not required to be funded under applicable Law, from and
after the Closing), GE agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Abbott and its
Affiliates and its and their officers, directors, employees, and agents from
and against any and all costs, damages, losses, expenses, or other
Liabilities arising out of or related to the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees
whose benefits under the Abbott Pension Plans are transferred to the Non-U.S.
GE Pension Plans.

  

(g) For purposes of this _Section 8.4_ , actuarial determinations shall be
based upon the actuarial assumptions and methodologies used in preparing the
most recent audited financial statements of Abbott as of the date of the
determination. The applicable plan sponsor of the plans shall cause the plan
actuary or administrator to provide a report of its determination of such
amount within 90 days of the Closing and any back-up information reasonably
required by GE to confirm the accuracy of such determination. If GE disputes
the accuracy of the calculation, GE and Abbott shall cooperate to identify
the basis for such disagreement and act in good faith to resolve such
dispute. To the extent that a dispute is unresolved after a 45 day period
following identification of such dispute, the calculations shall be verified
by an independent third party benefits consulting firm selected by the mutual

        

agreement of the parties. The decision of such consulting firm shall be
final, binding and conclusive on all parties to this Agreement. GE and Abbott
shall share equally the costs of such consulting firm.

  

8.5 _U.S. Defined Contribution Plans._

  

(a) Effective as of the Closing, GE shall establish or designate defined
contribution plans that are intended to be qualified under Code Section
401(a) (collectively, the " _U.S. GE DC Plans_ ") for the benefit of the U.S.
Transferred Employees. Each U.S. Transferred Employee as of the Closing shall
be eligible to participate in a U.S. GE DC Plan pursuant to the terms of such
plan.

  

(b) Each U.S. GE DC Plan shall provide for the receipt in cash from U.S.
Transferred Employees of "eligible rollover distributions" (as such term is
defined under Section 402 of the Code). As soon as practicable following the
Closing Date, GE shall provide Abbott with such documents and other
information as Abbott shall reasonably request to assure itself that the U.S.
GE DC Plans are tax-qualified and provide for the receipt of
eligible rollover distributions. Each U.S. Transferred Employee shall be
given the opportunity to receive a distribution of his or her account balance
under any Abbott defined contribution plan that is intended to be qualified
under Code Section 401(a) shall be given the opportunity to elect to "roll
over" such account balance to a U.S. GE DC Plan, subject to and in accordance
with the provisions of such plan(s) and applicable Law. GE and Abbott shall
work together in order to facilitate any such distribution or rollover and to
effect an eligible rollover distribution for those U.S. Transferred Employees
who elect to rollover their account balances directly into a U.S. GE DC Plan.

  

8.6 _Non-U.S. Defined Contribution Plans._

  

(a) Effective as of the Closing, GE shall establish or designate defined
contribution plans (collectively, the " _Non-U.S. GE DC Plans_ ") for the
benefit of the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees who participated in one or more
of the defined contribution plans (other than a Transferred Abbott DC Plan)
maintained by Abbott or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing
outside the United States (collectively, the " _Non-U.S. Abbott DC Plans_ ").
Such Non-U.S. Transferred Employees are referred to hereinafter as the " _DC
Employees_ ". Each Non-U.S. GE DC Plan shall provide employer matching
contribution formulas and provisions that are equivalent in value to the
employer matching contribution formulas and provisions in each corresponding
Non-U.S. Abbott DC Plan as of the Closing and GE shall either continue such
formulas or offer comparable retirement benefits to DC Employees for a period
of at least two years immediately following the Closing. The DC Employees
shall be given credit under the respective Non-U.S. GE DC Plan for all
service with and compensation from Abbott or its Affiliates as if it were
service with and compensation from GE for purposes of determining
eligibility, vesting and the amount of any benefits or benefit accruals under
each respective Non-U.S. GE DC Plan.

  

(b) With respect to a Non-U.S. Abbott DC Plan, Abbott shall cause the
transfer under each such Non-U.S. Abbott DC Plan to the corresponding
Non-U.S. GE DC Plan of cash or cash equivalents equal to the actual account
balances of the DC Employees under

        

each such Non-U.S. Abbott DC Plan as of the Closing or such greater amount as
is required by the applicable regulatory authority having jurisdiction over
the Non-U.S. Abbott DC Plan in order to obtain approval of such transfer (the
" _DC Transfer Amount_ "). The transfer of the DC Transfer Amounts shall be
subject to such consents, approvals and other legal requirements as may apply
under applicable Law. GE shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the DC Transfer Amounts to be accepted by such plans. To the extent a Non-U.S.
Abbott DC Plan is not required to be funded by applicable Law, there shall be
no transfer of assets.

  

(c) The DC Transfer Amounts to be transferred, if any, from the respective
Non-U.S. Abbott DC Plans shall be equitably adjusted to take into account
benefit payments made from the respective Non-U.S. Abbott DC Plans to the DC
Employees after the Closing but prior to the date of transfer and for any
earnings and losses on such amount during such period. The transfer of the
DC Transfer Amount, if any, shall take place within one hundred and eighty
(180) days after the date of Closing.

  

(d) At the times of the transfers of the DC Transfer Amounts (or if there is
no transfer of assets with respect to a particular plan because the plan is
not required to be funded under applicable Law, at the Closing), GE and the
Non-U.S. GE DC Plans shall assume all Liabilities with respect to or relating
to Non-U.S. Transferred Employees under the applicable Non-U.S. Abbott DC
Plan and Abbott and its Affiliates and the Non-U.S. Abbott DC Plans shall be
relieved of all such Liabilities under such Non-U.S. Abbott DC Plan with
respect to the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees. From and after the date of
the transfer of the DC Transfer Amount (or if there is no transfer of assets
with respect to a particular plan because the plan is not required to be
funded under applicable Law, as of the Closing), GE agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless Abbott and its Affiliates and its and their officers,
directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all costs, damages,
losses, expenses, or other Liabilities arising out of or related to the
Non-U.S. Transferred Employees under the applicable Non-U.S. Abbott DC Plans.

  

8.7 _U.S. Retiree Medical and Life._

  

(a) Abbott shall extend retiree health and life insurance coverage under the
retiree health and life insurance plans provided by Abbott and its Affiliates
(the " _Abbott Retiree Welfare Plans_ ") to each U.S. Transferred Employee
(including any of his or her eligible dependents) who, as of the Closing, is
eligible for such coverage under the Abbott Retiree Welfare Plans. Each U.S.
Transferred Employee not described in the foregoing sentence shall, for
eligibility purposes only (but not level of benefits or employee
contributions), be credited with up to an additional three years of age and
service under the Abbott Retiree Welfare Plans, but only to the extent such
additional years are required for such U.S. Transferred Employee to become
eligible for coverage under the Abbott Retiree Welfare Plans (each U.S.
Transferred Employee who, by reason of the additional crediting of age or
service hereunder, becomes eligible to participate in the Abbott
Retiree Welfare Plans, a " _Transitional Retiree_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, only actual years of service with Abbott and its Affiliates prior
to the Closing shall be taken into account for purposes of determining
employee contribution levels under the Abbott Retiree Welfare Plans;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Transitional Retirees who have less than ten
years of service with Abbott and its Affiliates as of the Closing shall be
eligible for benefits under the Abbott Retiree Welfare Plans at the employee
contribution level for

        

employees with ten years of service (as in effect from time to time) under
such plans. Each Transitional Retiree shall be eligible to elect
commencement of coverage under the Abbott Retiree Welfare Plans after the
later of (i) attainment of age 50 and (ii) the tenth anniversary of the date
of commencement of the Transitional Retirees service (for purposes of the
Abbott Retiree Welfare Plans) with Abbott or its Affiliates. Any post-
retirement healthcare and life insurance coverage provided to Transitional
Retirees (and his or her eligible dependents) shall be subject in all
respects to the terms and conditions of the Abbott Retiree Welfare Plans as
in effect from time to time. Abbott shall be solely liable for any such
post-retirement healthcare and life insurance coverage.

  

(b) Abbott expressly reserves the right to amend, alter, modify or terminate
the terms of the Abbott Retiree Welfare Plans, as the case may be, at any
time and to interpret the provisions of those plans with respect to its
employees, the Transitional Retirees and all of its other former employees
and their respective dependents; _provided_ , _however_ , that Abbott agrees
that any amendments, alterations, modifications, or terminations with respect
to those plans shall be applied in a consistent manner to Abbott retirees
and Transitional Retirees who are eligible for coverage under those plans.
Abbott shall not be responsible or otherwise liable for the provision of
post-retirement healthcare and life insurance coverage to any U.S.
Transferred Employees other than as expressly provided in this _Section 8.7_.

  

8.8 _Deferred Compensation._ Abbott shall retain responsibility under all
deferred compensation and supplemental retirement arrangements that are not
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code with respect to the
benefits of the U.S. Business Employees, including the U.S. Transferred
Employees.  Abbott shall have no responsibility with respect to
deferred compensation and supplemental retirement arrangements created after
the Closing for the benefit of the U.S. Transferred Employees.

  

8.9 _Equity Compensation._

  

(a) Effective as of the Closing, the Abbott Compensation Committee shall take
the necessary actions on or prior to the Closing solely with respect to
Transferred Employees under the equity plans and programs established by
Abbott (the " _Abbott Stock Plans_ ") to provide that (i) each outstanding
stock option to purchase one or more common shares of Abbott (each, an "
_Abbott Option_ ") which is not exercisable as of the Closing shall become
exercisable as of the Closing and (ii) the restrictions on each share of
Abbott restricted stock (each, a share of " _Abbott Restricted Stock_ ") and
each restricted stock unit (each, an " _Abbott RSU_ ") shall lapse as of the
Closing.  Each Abbott Option, each share of Abbott Restricted Stock and each
RSU held by a Transferred Employee who has not, as of the Closing, attained
the age of 50 or has less than ten years of service with Abbott or any of
its Affiliates, shall be treated in accordance with the applicable terms of
the applicable Abbott Stock Plans. Each Transferred Employee who has, as of
the Closing, attained the age of 50 and has ten or more years of service with
Abbott or any of its Affiliates, shall be treated as a "retiree" under and in
accordance with the applicable terms of the applicable Abbott Stock Plans.

  

(b) _ESPP_. Effective as of the Closing, each Transferred Employee who
participates in an employee stock purchase plan maintained by Abbott or its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Abbott ESPPs_ ") shall
cease participation in the applicable

        

Abbott ESPPs and shall have his or her payroll deductions refunded by Abbott
as soon as administratively practicable in accordance with the terms of the
Abbott ESPPs. As of the Closing, Transferred Employees shall be eligible to
participate in the employee stock purchase plans sponsored by GE in
accordance with the terms of such plans.

  

8.10 _U.S. Career Transition Incentive_. As soon as reasonably practicable,
and in no event later than sixty (60) days after Closing, Abbott and its
actuaries shall calculate the aggregate bonus amount (the " _Bonus Amount_ ")
for all U.S. Transferred Employees who have attained at least age 40 as of
the Closing (each, a " _CTI Employee_ ") and shall notify GE of such
calculations (the " _Notification_ "), providing GE relevant back-up
information reasonably required to confirm the accuracy of such calculation.
The Bonus Amount shall be equal to or greater than the aggregate incremental
increase in the "accumulated benefit obligations" (as defined in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) as of the Closing under the Abbott
Pension Plans maintained in the United States (the " _U.S. Abbott Pension
Plans_ ") and under the supplemental pension arrangements that are not
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code maintained by
Abbott or its Affiliates (the " _Abbott NQ Plans_ "), assuming an increase in
the present value of the accrued benefits (but excluding any increase
attributable to interest) under the U.S. Abbott Pension Plans and Abbott NQ
Plans over a three year period for all CTI Employees, calculated using the
actuarial assumptions and methodologies that were used in preparing the most
recent audited financial statements of Abbott. The Bonus Amount shall not,
in any event, exceed $75,000,000. ** **If GE disputes the accuracy of
the calculation, it shall notify Abbott of such dispute within two (2) weeks
after the date of the Notification and GE and Abbott shall cooperate to
identify the basis for such disagreement and act in good faith to resolve
such dispute. To the extent that a dispute is unresolved, the accuracy of the
calculations shall be verified no later than three (3) weeks after the date
of the Notification by an independent third party benefits consulting firm
selected by the mutual agreement of the parties. The decision of such
consulting firm shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties to this
Agreement. GE and Abbott shall share equally the costs of such consulting
firm. Within thirty (30) days of GEs receipt of the Notification, GE shall
pay each CTI Employee a cash payment representing an appropriate share of the
Bonus Amount based on the foregoing calculations under this _Section 8.10_.

  

8.11 _Mutual Non-Hire._ Without the prior written consent of GE, neither
Abbott nor any of its Affiliates shall, for a period of two (2) years
following the Closing, hire, whether as an employee or independent
contractor, any person who is a Transferred Employee. Without the prior
written consent of Abbott, neither GE nor any of its Affiliates shall, on
behalf of GE Healthcare, for a period of two (2) years following the Closing,
hire, whether as an employee or independent contractor, (i) any person who
was employed by Abbott or any of its Affiliates in the Business but who
is not a Transferred Employee and who is employed by Abbott, (ii) any person
who was employed by Abbott or any of its Affiliates in the Business but who
is not a Transferred Employee and who resigned or retired from Abbott six (6)
months prior to the Closing or (iii) any person who is employed by Abbott in
the Abbott Diabetes Care Business or the Abbott Molecular
Diagnostics Business. Without the prior written consent of Abbott, neither
GE nor any of its Affiliates shall hire any employee of Abbott or any
Affiliate of Abbott with whom GE came into contact in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement or the related integration and transition
matters associated with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any
exceptions to the foregoing sentences shall be jointly approved by Abbotts

        

Senior Vice President, Human Resources and GE Healthcares Senior Vice
President, Human Resources, or their delegates.

  

8.12 _Deferred Closing Jurisdictions_. For purposes of this _Article 8_ ,
in respect of any Deferred Closing Jurisdiction, (a) subject to clause (d)
below, GE and Abbott shall mutually agree in good faith on appropriate
arrangements to continue the Abbott compensation and employee benefits
(including statutory arrangements) for the Business Employees as of the
Closing (unless otherwise agreed by GE or required by applicable Law), at the
expense of GE, until the date of the Deferred Local Closing or such other
date as may be agreed upon by GE and Abbott, (b) except to the
extent otherwise required by applicable Law, Business Employees in any
Deferred Closing Jurisdiction shall not become Transferred Employees until
the Deferred Local Closing, (c) any Pension Transfer Amount and any DC
Transfer Amount shall be determined as of the applicable Deferred Local
Closing, in the same manner as provided in _Sections 8.4(b)_ and _8.6(b)_ ,
respectively, and, subject to such consents, approvals and other legal
requirements as may apply under applicable Law, Abbott shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the transfer of any Pension Transfer Amount and
any DC Transfer Amount to take place within 180 days of the applicable
Deferred Local Closing, in each case after taking into account adjustments
for earnings, gains/losses and benefit payments after the applicable Deferred
Local Closing but prior to the date of transfer, in the same manner as
provided in _Sections 8.4(d)_ and _8.6(c)_ , respectively, and (d) any
required adjustments to implement this _Article 8_  with respect to such
jurisdiction, including in respect of the timing and manner of payments
between Abbott, GE or any of their respective Affiliates, shall be set forth
in the business transfer agreement applicable to the Deferred Closing
Jurisdiction.

  

8.13 _Puerto Rico_. In the event of a Delayed PR Closing pursuant to _Section
7.15_ of this Agreement, for purposes of applying this _Article 8_ to
Business Employees in Puerto Rico, the terms "Closing" and "Closing Date"
shall mean the "Delayed PR Closing" and the "Delayed PR Closing
Date", respectively.

  

 **ARTICLE 9**

  

 **TAXES**

  

9.1 _Abbott and GE Indemnities._

  

(a) Abbott and its Affiliates shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to
_Article 12_ , shall indemnify and hold harmless the GE Indemnified Parties
against any and all Losses (as such terms are defined in _Section 12.2(a)_ )
incurred by such GE Indemnified Party in connection with or arising from (i)
all Taxes applicable to the Business, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities that are attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period; and (ii) all
Taxes arising from any action required or contemplated by _Section 7.11_
hereof relating to Intercompany Arrangements; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Abbott shall not be liable for and not be required to indemnify against (x)
any Taxes (other than Income Taxes) set forth on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet, unless such Taxes in the aggregate exceed the aggregate amount of such
Taxes set forth on the Closing Date Balance Sheet (the aggregate of the Taxes
(other than Income Taxes) set forth on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, "
_Excluded Taxes_ ") or (y) any and all

        

Losses related to Taxes described in (i) or (ii) above (other than such Taxes
themselves) for which GE or its Affiliates are responsible for filing the
applicable Tax Return except to the extent that such Losses arise out of the
action or inaction of Abbott or any of its Affiliates.

  

(b) GE and its Affiliates shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to
_Article 12_ shall indemnify the Abbott Indemnified Parties with respect to,
any Excluded Taxes and any and all Losses related thereto (other than such
Excluded Taxes themselves) arising out of the action or inaction of GE or any
of its Affiliates.

  

9.2 _Apportionment of Taxes._

  

(a) With respect to any Tax Return for any Straddle Period related to the
Business or the Purchased Assets, the party responsible for preparing such
Tax Return shall, to the extent permitted by Law, elect to treat the Closing
Date as the last day of the taxable year or period and shall apportion any
Taxes arising out of or relating to a Straddle Period to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period under a "closing-of-the-books" method
as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2) (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law). In any case where applicable Law
does not permit the relevant party to treat the Closing Date as the last day
of the taxable year or period, any Taxes arising out of or relating to a
Straddle Period shall be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
Post-Closing Tax Period based on such a closing-of-the-books method;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annualized basis (including depreciation, amortization
and depletion deductions) shall be apportioned on a daily pro rata basis,
(ii) solely for purposes of determining the marginal tax rate applicable to
income during such period in a jurisdiction in which such tax rate
depends upon the level of income, annualized income shall be taken into
account, and (iii) Real Property Taxes and personal property Taxes shall be
allocated in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 9.2(b)_.

  

(b) All personal property Taxes, Real Property Taxes and similar ad valorem
obligations levied with respect to the Purchased Assets or the Business for a
Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and
Post-Closing Tax Period based on the number of days included in each such
period.

  

9.3 _Tax Return Filing and Amendment._

  

(a) With respect to any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period and for a
Straddle Period relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets that has not
been filed on or before the Closing Date, the party that is obligated to file
such Tax Return under applicable Law shall prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, such Tax Return and pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes
shown as due thereon.

  

(b) The party preparing and filing a Tax Return described in _Section 9.3(a)_
that includes a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which indemnification may be
required under _Article 12_ or the party filing an amendment to such Tax
Return, shall deliver, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date
on which the Tax Return shall be filed, to the other party (against whom a
claim for indemnification may be made under _Article 12_ as a result of the
filing of such Tax Return or amended Tax Return) a statement setting forth
the amount of Taxes for

        

which such other party may be liable under _Article 12_ (as determined
below), and copies of such Tax Returns. Such other party shall have the
right to review and comment on the form and substance of such statement and
Tax Returns.  Abbott and GE agree to consult and resolve in good faith any
issue arising as a result of the review of such statement and Tax
Returns. Notwithstanding the indemnification claim procedure set forth in
_Sections 12.2_ and _12.3_ , no later than five (5) days prior to the due
date for the filing of each such Tax Return, the non-filing party shall pay
to the party filing such Tax Return an amount equal to the amount such party
is liable for under _Article 12_ if the amount of Taxes reflected on such Tax
Return were the final amount of Taxes owing with respect to such Tax Return
under applicable Law. Any Tax Return to be prepared and filed under this
_Section 9.3_ shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be prepared
on a basis consistent with the last previous Tax Return relating to the
Business or the Purchased Asset. Any Tax Return prepared pursuant to this
_Section 9.3_ shall not be dispositive of the amount of Taxes allocable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period for each such Tax Return for purposes of
determining the amount of  liability under _Section 12.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section
12.3(a)(iv)_ , if Abbott and GE are unable to resolve their differences
regarding such Tax Return prior to filing.

  

(c) If there shall be any conflicts between the provisions of this _Section
9.3_ and _Section 9.7_ (relating to Conveyance Taxes), the provisions of
_Section 9.7_  shall control with respect to Conveyance Taxes.

  

9.4 _Refunds._ Abbott shall be entitled to retain or, to the extent actually
received by, or credited to, GE or its Affiliates, receive immediate payment
from GE or any of its Affiliates of, any refund or credit with respect
to Taxes (including refunds arising by reason of amended Tax Returns filed
after the Closing or otherwise) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
relating to the Purchased Assets or the Business except to the extent such
Taxes (or refunds or credits with respect to such Taxes) are reflected on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet. GE shall be entitled to retain or, to the extent
actually received by, or credited to, Abbott or its Affiliates, receive
immediate payment from Abbott or any of its Affiliates of, any refund or
credit with respect to Taxes (including refunds arising by reason of amended
Tax Returns filed after the Closing or otherwise) with respect to any Post-
Closing Tax Period relating to the Purchased Assets or the Business or with
respect to Taxes, refunds or credits that are reflected on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet. Abbott shall cooperate with GE to enable GE to obtain any
refund or credit with respect to Taxes to the extent such refund or credit is
reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and GE shall cooperate with
Abbott in securing any refund or credit of Taxes to which Abbott would be
entitled under this _Section 9.4_. Any refund or credit of Taxes with respect
to a Straddle Period shall be apportioned to the Pre-Closing and Post-Closing
Tax Periods in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 9.2_.
Except to the extent applicable Law requires otherwise, the party receiving
the refund shall treat the receipt of such payment as not constituting income
subject to Tax. Any payment made pursuant to this _Section 9.4_ shall be net
of any Taxes imposed on the payor as a result of its receipt of such refund
increased by any Tax benefit to which the payor becomes entitled as a result
of the payment made pursuant to this _Section 9.4_.

  

9.5 _Resolution of Tax Controversies_. If a claim shall be made by any
Governmental Authority or taxing authority that might result in an indemnity
payment under _Section 12.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section 12.3(a)(iv)_ , the party that
would be required to pay such amount shall promptly be notified by the party
entitled to such indemnity to the extent that the

        

Governmental Authority or taxing authority did not notify the indemnifying
party of such claim, _provided_ that, failure to comply with this provision
shall not affect the right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent
such failure materially impairs the indemnifying partys ability to contest
any such Tax liabilities. In the event that a Governmental Authority or a
taxing authority determines a deficiency in any Tax, the party
ultimately responsible for such Tax under this Agreement, whether by
indemnity or otherwise, shall have authority to determine whether to dispute
such deficiency determination and to control the prosecution or settlement of
such dispute; _provided_  that with respect to Straddle Periods, Abbott and
GE shall jointly control the dispute. The party that is not ultimately
responsible for such Tax under this Agreement shall have the right to
participate at its own expense in the conduct of any such
proceeding involving a Tax claim that would, if the relevant taxing authority
were successful in asserting its claim, adversely affect such party.

  

9.6 _Tax Cooperation_. Abbott and GE agree to furnish or cause to
be furnished to the other party, upon request, as promptly as practical,
such information and records and assistance (including making such of
their respective officers, directors, employees and agents available as
may reasonably be requested by such other party) in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return, audit or other proceeding that relates to the
Purchased Assets or the Business. Any expense incurred in providing such
information or assistance shall be borne by the party requesting it.

  

9.7 _Conveyance Taxes_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
all transfer, documentary, recording, sales, use, registration, stamp and
other similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes, but
excluding any Taxes based on or attributable to income or capital gains)
together with any conveyance fees, notarial and registry fees and recording
costs (including any penalties and interest thereon) imposed by any taxing
authority or other Governmental Authority with respect to the transfer of the
Purchased Assets and the Business to GE or its Affiliates pursuant to this
Agreement (the " _Conveyance Taxes_ ") shall be borne by GE and its
Affiliates, regardless of which party is obligated to pay (or has paid) such
Taxes under applicable Law, _provided_  that the excess of such Conveyance
Taxes over $100,000,000 shall be borne equally by GE and its Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Abbott and its Affiliates on the other hand, regardless of
which party is obligated to pay (or has paid) such Taxes under applicable
Law.

  

(b) Each of Abbott and GE shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, all Tax Returns relating to Conveyance Taxes that such party (or its
Affiliates) is obligated to prepare and file under applicable Law and shall
pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes shown as due thereon.  The filing party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Tax Returns with
respect to Conveyance Taxes it (or any of its Affiliates) is obligated to
file to the non-filing party at least ten (10) days prior to the due date for
the filing of such Tax Returns (taking into account any valid extension).
Abbott and GE shall cooperate to timely file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such Conveyance Taxes, and, if
required by applicable Law, the parties shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.  GE and Abbott agree to cooperate

        

to use any available methods permitted under applicable Law to minimize the
liability for Conveyance Taxes.

  

(c) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, GE and Abbott shall
exchange information regarding the total amount of Conveyance Taxes paid by
it and its Affiliates and the date upon which such Conveyance Taxes were
paid. If the parties total combined liabilities for Conveyance Taxes amount
to a sum of less than $100,000,000, GE shall reimburse Abbott for all
Conveyance Taxes paid by Abbott and its Affiliates pursuant to this _Section
9.7_. If, on the other hand, such total exceeds $100,000,000, GE and Abbott
shall reimburse one another as appropriate so that, in the aggregate, GE
bears at least but no more than (x) $100,000,000 of Conveyance Taxes plus (y)
50% of the total Conveyance Taxes in excess of $100,000,000 and so that
Abbott bears all remaining Conveyance Taxes. Appropriate adjustments shall
be made to such reimbursements to reflect any changes in Conveyance Taxes
after such sixty (60) day period. Any payment required to be made under this
_Section 9.7(c)_ from Abbott to GE or from GE to Abbott shall bear interest
at the Agreed Rate from the date the applicable Conveyance Tax was paid until
the date of payment under this _Section 9.7(c)_.  For purposes of such
interest calculation, it shall be assumed that GE was responsible for the
first $100,000,000 in Conveyance Taxes paid, based on the date of payment,
and that GE and Abbott were each responsible for 50% of any remaining
Conveyance Taxes paid on or after the date total Conveyance Taxes exceeded
$100,000,000.

  

9.8 _Survival of Obligations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, and notwithstanding _Article 12_ , the obligations of
the parties set forth in this _Article 9_ shall be unconditional and
absolute and shall remain in effect without limitation as to time.

Abbott may reasonably request; _provided_ that Abbott shall have no Liability
with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_
for which Abbott did not promptly receive written notice from such GE
Indemnified Party, to the extent Abbott shall have been prejudiced
thereby; and _provided_ _further_ , that Abbott shall have no Liability
with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to (x) clause (iv) of
_Section 12.2(a)_ for which Abbott did not receive such specific written
notice from GE within thirty (30) days after the applicable Environmental
Review Commencement Date, (y) clause (v) of _Section 12.2(a)_ for which
Abbott did not receive such specific written notice from GE within thirty
(30) days after the date of this Agreement or for which the Loss shall not
have occurred within eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date or (z)
clause (vi) of _Section 12.2(a)_ for which Abbott did not receive such
specific written notice from GE within twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date. No GE Indemnified Party shall admit any Liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, any such matter covered by this _Section
12.2_ without Abbotts prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, the GE
Indemnified Party shall have the right, with the consent of Abbott (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to settle all indemnifiable
matters related to Third-Party Claims which are susceptible to being settled,
and to defend (without the consent of Abbott) through counsel of its own
choosing any Action which may be brought by a third Person in connection
therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that Abbott shall have the right to have
its counsel participate fully in such defense at its own expense. GE and
Abbott shall keep each other reasonably informed of all settlement
negotiations with third Persons regarding the provisions hereof and of the
progress of any litigation with third Persons regarding the provisions
hereof.  GE and Abbott shall permit each other reasonable access to books
and records and otherwise cooperate with all reasonable requests of each
other in connection with any indemnifiable matter resulting from a claim by a
third Person.

        

12.3 _Indemnification by GE._

  

(a) _GE s Indemnity_. From and after the Closing, GE shall indemnify and
hold harmless Abbott and its Affiliates, officers, directors, agents,
successors and assigns and, solely with respect to Losses arising out of or
related to the Consent Decree, any Abbott Consent Decree Defendants that are
not otherwise identified in this clause (a) above (all such parties are
collectively referred to as the " _Abbott Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against and in respect of all Losses which Abbott and its Affiliates may
actually suffer or incur to the extent arising out of or related to:

  

(i) the Assumed Liabilities (except to the extent GE is entitled to
indemnification with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)(iv)_ ,
_(v)_ or _(vi)_ );

  

(ii) failure by GE or any of its Affiliates to perform any of their covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement;

  

(iii) any Liabilities arising from the operation of the Business on or after
the Closing (other than the Excluded Liabilities), and, in each such case,
for which Abbott gives GE written notice of a claim for reimbursement
following Closing in accordance with _Section 12.3(b)_ ; or

  

(iv) Taxes, Conveyance Taxes and any other amounts for which GE is liable
pursuant to _Article 9_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that GE shall not be
liable for any Losses related to Taxes described in _Section 9.1(b)_ (other
than such Excluded Taxes themselves) except to the extent such Losses arise
out of the action or inaction of GE or any of its Affiliates.

  

(b) _Notice of Claims_. Any Abbott Indemnified Party seeking indemnification
under _Section 12.3(a)_ shall promptly upon becoming aware of any such
matters provide a notice to GE in writing describing in reasonable detail the
facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification; _provided_  that GE shall
have no Liability with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 12.3(a)_ for which GE did not promptly receive written notice from
such Abbott Indemnified Party to the extent GE shall have been prejudiced
thereby. No Abbott Indemnified Party shall admit any Liability with respect
to, or settle, compromise or discharge any such matter covered by this
_Section 12.3_  without GEs prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Subject to the immediately preceding
sentence, the Abbott Indemnified Party shall have the right, with the consent
of GE (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to settle all
indemnifiable matters related to Third-Party Claims which are susceptible to
being settled, and to defend (without the consent of GE) through counsel
of its own choosing, any Action which may be brought by a third Person
in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that GE shall have
the right to have its counsel participate fully in such defense at its
own expense. GE and Abbott shall keep each other reasonably informed of all
settlement negotiations with third Persons regarding the provisions hereof
and of the progress of any litigation with third Persons regarding the
provisions hereof.  GE and Abbott shall permit each other reasonable access
to books and records and otherwise cooperate with all reasonable requests of
each other in connection with any indemnifiable matter resulting from a claim
by a third Person.

        

12.4 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 13.11_ or
as otherwise set forth in any Ancillary Agreement, from and after the
Closing, the rights and remedies set forth in this _Article 12_
shall constitute the sole and exclusive rights and remedies of GE and Abbott
with respect to this Agreement, the events giving rise to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.  Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, neither party shall have any rights to set-off indemnifiable
Losses pursuant to this _Article 12_  against other obligations owed to the
other party.

  

12.5 _Calculation of Damages_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither party shall have Liability under or in connection with any claim for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 12_ for any claim (i) for punitive,
incidental, consequential, lost profits, special or indirect damages or (ii)
with respect to claims made by a GE Indemnified Party, to the extent such
claim is reserved as a dollar amount on the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the amount of
any Losses incurred or suffered by a GE Indemnified Party or an Abbott
Indemnified Party entitled to indemnification hereunder pursuant to _Section
12.2(a)_ or _Section 12.3(a)_ , as applicable, shall be calculated after
giving effect to: (i) any insurance proceeds received by such Person (or any
of its Affiliates) with respect to such Losses; (ii) any Tax benefit or
detriment actually realized by such Person (or any of its Affiliates) arising
from the facts or circumstances giving rise to such Losses or from receipt of
the indemnity payment; and (iii) any recoveries obtained by such Person (or
any of its Affiliates) from any other third Person. Each such Person shall
exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
proceeds, benefits and recoveries. If any such proceeds, benefits or
recoveries are received by such Person (or any of its Affiliates) with
respect to any Losses after such Person (or any Affiliate) has received the
benefit of any indemnification hereunder with respect thereto, such Person
(or such Affiliate) shall pay to the party providing such indemnification the
amount of such proceeds, benefits or recoveries, less such Persons expenses
(up to the amount of the indemnification payment).

  

(c) Abbott shall not be liable under _Section 12.2_ for any Losses (nor shall
any such Losses reduce the $100,000,000 deductible provided in clause (x) of
the last paragraph of _Section 12.2(a)_ ) relating to any matter to the
extent that any GE Indemnified Party was reimbursed for such Losses pursuant
to the purchase price adjustment set forth in _Section 3.3_ or would have
been reimbursed for such Losses pursuant to such adjustment if the Minimum
Net Worth Amount used in calculating such adjustment was $2,078,228,000.

  

12.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. For all Tax purposes, the parties
agree to treat all payments made under any indemnity provisions contained in
this Agreement as adjustments to the Purchase Price, except to the extent
applicable Law requires otherwise.

        

 **ARTICLE 13**

  

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

  

13.1 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no assignment shall be made by either party
without the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, either party may assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement without such consent to an Affiliate or in connection with a sale,
merger or other transaction involving a transfer of substantially all of its
assets; _provided_ _that_ , such assigning party shall remain primarily
liable for its obligations hereunder.

  

13.2 _Public Announcements_. Neither party shall issue nor make any
public announcement, press release or other public disclosure regarding this
Agreement or its subject matter without the other partys prior written
consent, except for any such disclosure that is, in the opinion of the
disclosing partys counsel, required by applicable Law or the rules of a
stock exchange on which the securities of the disclosing party are listed. In
the event a party is, in the opinion of its counsel, required to make a
public disclosure by applicable Law or the rules of a stock exchange on which
its securities are listed, such party shall, to the extent practicable,
submit the proposed disclosure in writing to the other party prior to the
date of disclosure and provide the other party a reasonable opportunity to

consummated, and except as otherwise specified herein, each party shall bear
its own expenses with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

13.4 _Severability_. Each of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall
be severable, and the unenforceability of one shall not affect the
enforceability of any others or of the remainder of this Agreement.

  

13.5 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except in respect of a GE Indemnified
Party or Abbott Indemnified Party who is not a party hereto, this Agreement
is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and
nothing herein, express or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any
Person, other than the parties hereto and such permitted assigns, any legal
or equitable rights hereunder.

  

13.6 _Waiver._ The failure of any party to enforce any condition or part of
this Agreement at any time shall not be construed as a waiver of that
condition or part, nor shall it forfeit any rights to future enforcement
thereof. Any waiver hereunder shall be effective only if delivered to the
other party hereto in writing by the party making such waiver.

  

13.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with and governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to the conflicts of Laws provisions thereof.

  

13.8 _Alternative Dispute Resolution_. The parties recognize that from time to
time a dispute may arise (a) relating to negotiation and finalization of
the Ancillary Agreements (b) with respect to determinations of (i) whether
a particular asset is a Purchased Asset or an

        

Excluded Asset, a particular Liability is an Assumed Liability or an Excluded
Liability or any Mixed-Use Intellectual Property constitutes GE Mixed-Use
Intellectual Property or Abbott Mixed-Use Intellectual Property, (ii)
indemnification payments pursuant to this Agreement or (c) with respect to
interpretations of provisions of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.
The parties agree that any such dispute shall be exclusively resolved by the
ADR provisions set forth on _Schedule 13.8_ , the result of which shall be
binding upon the parties. The place for such ADR shall be Chicago, Illinois
or at such other place as may be agreed upon by GE and Abbott.

  

13.9 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any Action seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (other than those matters to be exclusively resolved pursuant to the
ADR provisions referred to in _Section 13.8_ ) shall be brought in the
United States District Court located in Wilmington, Delaware so long as such
court shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such Action, or
alternatively in the Delaware State Court located in Wilmington, Delaware if
the aforesaid United States District Court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, and that any cause of action arising out of this
Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in
the State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to
the jurisdiction of such court (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such Action and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such Action in any such court or that any such
Action which is brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such Action may be served on any party anywhere in the
world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of such court. Without
limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such
party as provided in _Section 13.15_ shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party.

  

13.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVES TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 13.10_.

  

13.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge that, in view of
the uniqueness of the Business, the Purchased Assets and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each party would not have an
adequate remedy at Law for money damages in the event that this Agreement has
not been performed in accordance with its terms, and therefore agrees that
the other party shall be entitled to specific enforcement of the terms hereof
in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled (in accordance
with _Section 13.9_ ), at Law or in equity and _Section 13.8_ shall not apply
to any such specific enforcement.

        

13.12 _Headings_. The headings of the sections and subsections of this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed
to constitute a part hereof.

counterparts, and each fully executed counterpart shall be deemed
an original.

  

13.14 _Further Documents_. Each of GE and Abbott shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to, at the request of the other party, execute
and deliver to such other party all such further instruments,
assignments, assurances and other documents as such other party may
reasonably request in connection with the carrying out of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

"hereof," "herein," and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless
otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole
