AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 7, 2019 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and between SunTrust Banks, Inc., a Georgia corporation (" _SunTrust_
"), and BBandT Corporation, a North Carolina corporation (" _BB andT_").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of BBandT and SunTrust have determined that it
is in the best interests of their respective companies and their shareholders
to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for
herein, pursuant to which SunTrust will, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, merge with and into BBandT (the " _Merger_ "), so that BBandT
is the surviving entity (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as
the " _Surviving Entity_ ") in the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of BBandT
and SunTrust have approved the Merger and this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement
is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the North Carolina Business Corporation Act (the " _NCBCA_ ")
and the Georgia Business Corporation Code (the " _GBCC_ "), at the Effective
Time, SunTrust shall merge with and into BBandT pursuant to this Agreement. BBandT
shall be the Surviving Entity in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of North Carolina. Upon consummation of
the Merger, the separate corporate existence of SunTrust shall terminate.

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place by electronic
exchange of documents at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date which shall
be no later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or waiver
(subject to applicable law) of all of the conditions set forth in Article VII
hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be

 



-1- 

    

 satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
thereof), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by
SunTrust and BBandT. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as the
" _Closing Date_."

1.3 _Effective Time_. On or (if agreed by SunTrust and BBandT) prior to the
Closing Date, BBandT and SunTrust, respectively, shall cause to be filed
articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of North Carolina
(the " _North Carolina Secretary_ ") and a certificate of merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia (the " _Georgia Secretary_ ")
(collectively, the " _Certificates of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become
effective at such time as specified in the Certificates of Merger
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the NCBCA and GBCC, or at such
other time as shall be provided by applicable law (such time hereinafter
referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the NCBCA and the
GBCC.

1.5 _Conversion of SunTrust Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of BBandT, SunTrust or the holder
of any securities of BBandT or SunTrust:

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of SunTrust issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _SunTrust Common Stock_ "), except for shares of
SunTrust Common Stock owned by SunTrust or BBandT (in each case other than
shares of SunTrust Common Stock (i) held in trust accounts, managed accounts,
mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity
that are beneficially owned by third parties or (ii) held, directly or
indirectly, by SunTrust or BBandT in respect of debts previously contracted),
shall be converted into the right to receive 1.295 shares (the " _Exchange
Ratio_ " and such shares the " _Merger Consideration_ ") of the common stock,
par value $5.00, of BBandT (the " _BB andT Common Stock_"); it being understood
that upon the Effective Time, pursuant to Section 1.6, the BBandT Common Stock,
including the shares issued to former holders of SunTrust Common Stock, shall

it being understood that any reference herein to " _Old Certificate_ " shall
be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to
the ownership of shares of SunTrust Common Stock) previously representing any
such shares of SunTrust Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive (i) a New Certificate representing the number of whole shares of
BBandT Common Stock which such shares of SunTrust Common Stock have been
converted into the right to receive, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares
which the shares of SunTrust Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate
have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.5
and Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon and (iii) any dividends or

 



-2- 

    

 distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.2, in each case, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the

Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged
for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split or reverse stock split, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or
distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the
Exchange Ratio to give BBandT and the holders of SunTrust Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ that nothing contained in this sentence shall be construed to
permit SunTrust or BBandT to take any action with respect to its securities or
otherwise that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of SunTrust Common Stock that are owned by
SunTrust or BBandT (in each case other than shares of SunTrust Common Stock (i)

Stock and each share of BBandT Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding
share of common stock or preferred stock, as applicable, of the Surviving
Entity and shall not be affected by the Merger.

BBandT having the same terms (taking into account that SunTrust will not be the
surviving entity in the Merger) as the SunTrust Series A Preferred Stock (all
shares of such newly created series, collectively, the " _BB andT Series I
Preferred Stock_") and, upon such conversion, the SunTrust Series A Preferred
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time.

shares of such newly created series, collectively, the " _BB andT Series J
Preferred Stock_") and, upon such conversion, the SunTrust Series B Preferred
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and

shares of such newly created series, collectively, the " _BB andT Series L
Preferred Stock_") and, upon such conversion, the SunTrust Series G Preferred
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of SunTrust Common
Stock (a " _SunTrust Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any
required action on part of the holder thereof, be converted into an option (a
" _BB andT Stock_ _Option_ ") to purchase (i) that number of shares of BBandT
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of
(A) the total number of shares of SunTrust Common Stock subject to such
SunTrust Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(B) the Exchange Ratio (as it may

 



-4- 

    

 be adjusted if necessary pursuant to the last sentence of Section 1.5(b)),
(ii) at an exercise price per share of BBandT Common Stock (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of (A) the exercise price per share
of SunTrust Common Stock of such SunTrust Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio (as it may be adjusted if
necessary pursuant to the last section of Section 1.5(b)); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the exercise price and the number of shares of BBandT Common
Stock purchasable pursuant to the SunTrust Stock Options shall be determined
in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal
Revenue Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any SunTrust Stock
Option to which Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code applies, the exercise
price and the number of shares of BBandT Common Stock purchasable pursuant to
such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to
such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Except as expressly provided in
this Section 1.8(a), each such BBandT Stock Option shall be subject to the same
terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms) as applied
to the corresponding SunTrust Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(b) At the Effective Time, each phantom stock unit award in respect of shares
of SunTrust Common Stock (a " _SunTrust Phantom Stock Award_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into an award of phantom stock units (a " _BB andT Phantom Stock Award_") in
respect of that number of shares of BBandT Common Stock (rounded to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of
SunTrust Common Stock subject to such SunTrust Phantom Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio
(as it may be adjusted if necessary pursuant to the last sentence of Section
1.5(b)). Except as expressly provided in this Section 1.8(b), each such BBandT
Phantom Stock Award shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including vesting terms) as applied to the corresponding SunTrust Phantom
Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of SunTrust Common
Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction (a "
_SunTrust Restricted Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any required action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into a restricted stock award (a "
_BB andT Restricted Stock Award_") in respect of that number of shares of BBandT
Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i)
the total number of shares of SunTrust Common Stock subject to the SunTrust
Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(ii) the Exchange Ratio (as it may be adjusted if necessary pursuant to the
last sentence of Section 1.5(b)). Except as expressly provided in this
Section 1.8(c), each such BBandT Restricted Stock Award shall be subject to the
same terms and conditions (including vesting terms) as applied to the
corresponding SunTrust Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(d) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of
shares of SunTrust Common Stock (a " _SunTrust RSU Award_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically

 



-5- 

    

 and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into a restricted stock unit award (a " _BB andT RSU Award_") in
respect of that number of shares of BBandT Common Stock (rounded to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of
SunTrust Common Stock subject to the SunTrust RSU Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (as it may be
adjusted if necessary pursuant to the last sentence of Section 1.5(b)). Each
such BBandT RSU Award shall be settlable in shares of BBandT Common Stock. Except
as expressly provided in this Section 1.8(c), each such BBandT RSU Award shall
be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms) as
applied to the corresponding SunTrust RSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, each performance stock unit award in respect of
shares of SunTrust Common Stock (a " _SunTrust PSU Award_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into a BBandT RSU Award in respect of that number of shares of BBandT Common
Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) total
number of shares of SunTrust Common Stock subject to the SunTrust PSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the number of shares
of SunTrust Common Stock determined based on (A) actual performance for the
portion of the performance period through the Effective Time as reasonably
determined by the compensation committee of the SunTrust Board of Directors
(the " _SunTrust Compensation Committee_ ") consistent with past practice,
and (B) target performance for the portion of the performance period following
the Effective Time through the remainder of the applicable performance
period, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (as it may be adjusted if
necessary pursuant to the last sentence of Section 1.5(b)). Each such BBandT PSU
Award shall be settlable in shares of BBandT Common Stock. Except as
specifically provided in this Section 1.8(e), each such BBandT RSU Award shall
be subject to the same terms and conditions (including service-based vesting
terms) as applied to the corresponding SunTrust PSU Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

 

(f) At or prior to the Effective Time, SunTrust, the Board of Directors of
SunTrust and the SunTrust Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall adopt
any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary or appropriate to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.8.

 

(g) As of the Effective Time, the number and kind of shares available for
issuance under each equity incentive plan of SunTrust shall be adjusted to
reflect BBandT Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable
plan.

(h) BBandT shall take all corporate actions that are necessary for the
assumption of the SunTrust Equity Awards pursuant to Section 1.8(a) through
1.8(e), including the reservation, issuance and listing of BBandT Common Stock
as necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.8. As
soon as practicable following the Effective Time, BBandT shall file with the SEC
a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 or a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares
of BBandT Common Stock underlying such SunTrust Equity Awards, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to

 



-6- 

    

 maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as
such assumed SunTrust Equity Awards remain outstanding.

 

1.9 _Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Entity_. At the Effective Time,
the articles of incorporation of BBandT, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Entity
until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

 

1.10 _Bylaws of Surviving Entity_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of BBandT,
as amended as set forth in _Exhibit A_ (such amendment, the " _BB andT Bylaw
Amendment_"), shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Entity until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable law.

 

1.11 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization
for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 

1.12 _Bank Merger_. Immediately following the Merger, SunTrust Bank, a
Georgia-chartered bank and wholly-owned Subsidiary of SunTrust (" _SunTrust
Subsidiary Bank_ "), will merge with and into Branch Banking and Trust
Company, a North Carolina-chartered commercial bank and wholly-owned
Subsidiary of BBandT (" _BB andT Subsidiary Bank_") (the " _Bank Merger_ "). BBandT
Subsidiary Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and,
following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of SunTrust
Subsidiary Bank shall cease. Promptly after the date of this Agreement, BBandT
Subsidiary Bank and SunTrust Subsidiary Bank will enter into an agreement and
plan of merger in form and substance agreed by BBandT and SunTrust, which shall
be customary for mergers similar to the Bank Merger (the " _Bank Merger
Agreement_ "). Each of BBandT and a wholly owned subsidiary of SunTrust shall
approve the Bank Merger Agreement and the Bank Merger as the sole shareholder
of BBandT Subsidiary Bank and SunTrust Subsidiary Bank, respectively, and BBandT
and SunTrust shall, and shall cause BBandT Subsidiary Bank and SunTrust
Subsidiary Bank, respectively, to, execute certificates or articles of merger
and such other documents and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank
Merger effective (" _Bank Merger Certificates_ ") immediately following the
Effective Time. The Bank Merger shall become effective at such time and date
as specified in the Bank Merger Agreement in accordance with applicable
law, or at such other time as shall be provided by applicable law.

2.1  _BB andT to Make Consideration Available_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, BBandT shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company mutually agreed upon by BBandT and SunTrust (the " _Exchange Agent_ "),
for exchange in accordance with this Article II for the benefit of the holders
of Old Certificates (which for purposes of this Article II shall be deemed to
include certificates or book-entry account 

 



-7- 

    

 statements representing shares of SunTrust Preferred Stock), certificates
or, at BBandTs option, evidence in book-entry form, representing shares of BBandT
Common Stock or New BBandT Preferred Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5
and Section 1.7, respectively (collectively, referred to herein as " _New
Certificates_ "), and cash in lieu of any fractional shares to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.2(e) (such cash and New Certificates, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect to shares of BBandT Common Stock or New
BBandT Preferred Stock payable in accordance with Section 2.2(b), being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, BBandT and SunTrust shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates
representing shares of SunTrust Common Stock or SunTrust Preferred Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive BBandT Common Stock or New BBandT
Preferred Stock, as applicable, pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for New Certificates
representing the number of whole shares of BBandT Common Stock and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares or shares of New BBandT Preferred Stock, as
applicable, which the shares of SunTrust Common Stock or SunTrust Preferred
Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any
dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon proper
surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or
Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
applicable, (i) (A) a New Certificate representing that number of whole
shares of BBandT Common Stock to which such holder of SunTrust Common Stock
shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (B) a
check representing the amount of (x) any cash in lieu of fractional shares
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate
or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II
and (y) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or (ii) (A) a New Certificate
representing that number of shares of New BBandT Preferred Stock to which such
holder of SunTrust Preferred Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the
provisions of Article I, and (B) a check representing the amount of any
dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.2(b), and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or dividends or distributions payable
to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the
number of whole shares of BBandT Common Stock or shares of New BBandT Preferred
Stock which the shares of SunTrust Common Stock or SunTrust Preferred Stock,
as applicable, represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into
the right to receive and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect
of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

 



-8- 

    

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to BBandT Common
Stock or New BBandT Preferred Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of an
Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to the whole shares of BBandT Common Stock or shares of New BBandT
Preferred Stock that the shares of SunTrust Common Stock or SunTrust Preferred
Stock, as applicable, represented by such Old Certificate have been converted
into the right to receive.

 

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of BBandT Common Stock or New
BBandT Preferred Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are
registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
(or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in
proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall
pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes
required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares
of BBandT Common Stock or New BBandT Preferred Stock in any name other than that
of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of SunTrust of the shares of SunTrust Common Stock or SunTrust
Preferred Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing
such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for New Certificates representing shares of BBandT
Common Stock or New BBandT Common Stock, as applicable, as provided in this
Article II.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of BBandT Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to BBandT Common Stock shall be payable on
or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of BBandT. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
BBandT shall pay to each former holder of SunTrust Common Stock who
otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average
of the closing-sale prices of BBandT Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
(the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for the consecutive
period of five (5) full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing
Date by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of
SunTrust Common Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective
Time and rounded to the nearest one-thousandth when expressed in decimal form)
of BBandT Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 1.5. The parties acknowledge that payment of such
cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately
bargained-for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise
be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.

 



-9- 

    

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of SunTrust for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the Surviving Entity. Any former holders of SunTrust Common
Stock or SunTrust Preferred Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for payment of
the shares of BBandT Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any
unpaid dividends and distributions on the BBandT Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each former share of SunTrust Common Stock such holder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, or the shares of New BBandT Preferred
Stock and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the New BBandT Preferred
Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of SunTrust Preferred Stock
such holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of BBandT,
SunTrust, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall
be liable to any former holder of shares of SunTrust Common Stock or SunTrust
Preferred Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

(g) BBandT shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent
to deduct and withhold, from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of BBandT
Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section
2.2 or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of SunTrust Common Stock, SunTrust Preferred Stock or SunTrust Equity
Awards, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by BBandT or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate
governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of SunTrust Common Stock,
SunTrust Preferred Stock or SunTrust Equity Awards in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by BBandT or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be.

 

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by BBandT or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond
in such amount as BBandT or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the shares of BBandT Common Stock
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, or the shares of New BBandT
Preferred Stock, as applicable, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SUNTRUST

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by SunTrust to
BBandT concurrently herewith (the " _SunTrust Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the SunTrust Disclosure Schedule as an

 



-10- 

    

 exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission
by SunTrust that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a
section of Article III shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of
Article III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other
sections of Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (b) as
disclosed in any SunTrust Reports filed by SunTrust since December 31, 2013
and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures
contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth
in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that
are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature), SunTrust hereby represents and warrants to BBandT as follows:

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) SunTrust is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Georgia, is a bank holding company
duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "
_BHC Act_ ") and has elected to be treated as a financial holding company
under the BHC Act. SunTrust has the corporate power and authority to
own, lease or operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. SunTrust is duly licensed or qualified
to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing,
qualification or standing necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified or to be in good standing would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on SunTrust. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material
Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to BBandT, SunTrust or the Surviving
Entity, as the case may be, any effect, change, event, circumstance,
condition, occurrence or development that, either individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, results of operations or
financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (
_provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material
Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes,
after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after
the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to
companies in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate,
or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes,
after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions
(including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market
(including equity, credit and debt markets, as well as changes in interest
rates) conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and not
specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries, (D) public disclosure
of the transactions contemplated hereby or actions expressly required by this
Agreement or that are taken with the prior written consent of the other party

implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
_Exchange Act_ ")) to ensure that material information relating to SunTrust,
including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and
the chief financial officer of SunTrust by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to

adversely affect SunTrusts ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
SunTrusts internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were
made in writing by management to SunTrusts auditors and audit committee.

certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with

controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that SunTrust or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no employee of or attorney
representing SunTrust or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
SunTrust or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material

_provided_ , that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the BBandT Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by BBandT that such
item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that
such item would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and
(iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of Article IV shall be
deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article IV specifically referenced

reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific
cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure
applies to such other sections or (b) as disclosed in any BBandT Reports filed
by BBandT since December 31, 2013, and prior to the date hereof (but
disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading

the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing,
qualification or standing necessary, except where the failure to be so

assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure

examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of
business of BBandT and its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or
has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of BBandT, investigation into

(a) The financial statements of BBandT and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the BBandT Reports (including the related notes,
where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the
books and records of BBandT and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes

respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in

-37- 

    

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on BBandT, neither BBandT nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for
those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of BBandT included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2018 (including any notes thereto) and for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since September 30, 2018, or in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of BBandT and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership of BBandT or its
Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership that would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on BBandT. BBandT (x) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to BBandT, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of BBandT by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to BBandTs outside
auditors and the audit committee of BBandTs Board of Directors (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect BBandTs
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in BBandTs internal controls over
financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to
BBandTs auditors and audit committee. There is no reason to believe
that BBandTs outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(d) Since January 1, 2016, (i) neither BBandT nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor,
to the knowledge of BBandT, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of BBandT or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of BBandT or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that BBandT or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and
(ii) no employee of or attorney representing BBandT or any of its Subsidiaries,

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually

which would reasonably be expected to subject any of the BBandT Benefit Plans or
their related trusts, BBandT, any of its Subsidiaries or any BBandT ERISA

Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of BBandT,
SunTrust or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) BBandT and SunTrust shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained, or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed.

6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of BBandT and
SunTrust, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of
the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by
this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries
to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors
and other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and
records, and each shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to
execute after the Effective Time the conversion or consolidation of systems
and business operations generally, and, during such period, each of BBandT and
SunTrust shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state
banking laws (other than reports or documents that BBandT or SunTrust, as the
case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (ii) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such
party may reasonably request. Neither BBandT nor SunTrust nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of BBandTs or SunTrusts, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common
interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Each of BBandT and SunTrust shall hold all information furnished by or on
behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated January 26, 2019, between BBandT and SunTrust (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive
the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

6.3 _Shareholders  Approvals_. Each of BBandT and SunTrust shall call a meeting
of its shareholders (the " _BB andT Meeting_" and the " _SunTrust Meeting_ ,"
respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is
declared effective, for the purpose of obtaining (a) the Requisite SunTrust
Vote and the Requisite BBandT Vote required in connection with this Agreement
and the Merger and (b) if so desired and mutually agreed, a vote upon other
matters of the type customarily brought before a meeting of shareholders in
connection with the approval of a merger agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby, and each of SunTrust and

 



-58- 

    

 BBandT shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur
as soon as reasonably practicable and on the same date. Each of BBandT and
SunTrust and their respective Boards of Directors shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of BBandT and SunTrust, as
applicable, the Requisite BBandT Vote and the Requisite SunTrust Vote, as
applicable, including by communicating to the respective shareholders of BBandT
and SunTrust its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement) that, in the case of BBandT, the shareholders of BBandT
approve this Agreement (the " _BB andT Board Recommendation_"), and in the case
of SunTrust, that the shareholders of SunTrust approve this Agreement (the "
_SunTrust Board Recommendation_ "), BBandT and each of BBandT and SunTrust and
their respective Boards of Directors shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, modify
or qualify in a manner adverse to the other party the BBandT Board
Recommendation, in the case of BBandT, or the SunTrust Board Recommendation, in
the case of SunTrust, (ii) fail to make the BBandT Board Recommendation, in the
case of BBandT, or the SunTrust Board Recommendation, in the case of SunTrust,
in the Joint Proxy Statement, (iii) adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an
Acquisition Proposal or publicly announce an intention to adopt, approve,
recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) fail to publicly and
without qualification (A) recommend against any Acquisition Proposal or (B)
reaffirm the BBandT Board Recommendation, in the case of BBandT, or the SunTrust
Board Recommendation, in the case of SunTrust, in each case within ten (10)
business days (or such fewer number of days as remains prior to the BBandT
Meeting or the SunTrust Meeting, as applicable) after an Acquisition Proposal
is made public or any request by the other party to do so, or (v) publicly
propose to do any of the foregoing (any of the foregoing a " _Recommendation
Change_ "). However, subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of
Directors of BBandT or SunTrust, after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors,
determines in good faith that it would more likely than not result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to make or continue to
make the BBandT Board Recommendation or the SunTrust Board Recommendation, as
applicable, such Board of Directors may, in the case of BBandT, prior to
the receipt of the Requisite BBandT Vote, and in the case of SunTrust, prior to
the receipt of the Requisite SunTrust Vote, submit this Agreement to its
shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this
Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which
event such Board of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law;
_provided_ that such Board of Directors may not take any actions under this
sentence unless it (A) gives the other party at least three (3) business days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable
description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to
take such action (including, in the event such action is taken in response to
an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the
identity of the third party in any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment
or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or
circumstances) and (B) at the end of such notice period, takes into account
any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party
and, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it
would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to make or continue to make the BBandT
Board Recommendation or SunTrust Board Recommendation, as the

 



-59- 

    

 case may be. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be
deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and
will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3. BBandT or
SunTrust shall adjourn or postpone the BBandT Meeting or the SunTrust Meeting,
as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally
scheduled there are insufficient shares of BBandT Common Stock or SunTrust
Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy)
to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or
if on the date of such meeting SunTrust or BBandT, as applicable, has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to
obtain the Requisite SunTrust Vote or the Requisite BBandT Vote. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, (x) the BBandT Meeting shall be convened and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of BBandT at the BBandT Meeting
and (y) the SunTrust Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be
submitted to the shareholders of SunTrust at the SunTrust Meeting, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either BBandT or SunTrust of such
obligation.

 

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of
this Agreement, each of BBandT and SunTrust shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by SunTrust or BBandT or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. BBandT shall cause the shares of BBandT Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

6.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, unless otherwise mutually determined by
SunTrust and BBandT, BBandT shall provide generally to employees of SunTrust and
its Subsidiaries who at the Effective Time become employees of BBandT or its
Subsidiaries (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), employee compensation and
benefits under the BBandT Benefit Plans on terms and conditions that are
substantially the same as those that apply to similarly situated BBandT
employees; _provided_ that BBandT may satisfy its obligation under this Section
6.6(a) for a transitional period (which transitional period shall end by the
later of (i) December 31, 2019 and (ii) the six (6) month anniversary of the
Closing Date) by providing compensation and benefits that are substantially
the same in the aggregate as the compensation and benefits provided by
SunTrust and its Subsidiaries to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Closing, SunTrust and BBandT shall cooperate in
reviewing, evaluating and analyzing the BBandT Benefit Plans and
SunTrust Benefit Plans with a view towards developing appropriate new benefit
plans with respect to employees of the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries

 



-60- 

    

 (which shall in any event include the BBandT Corporation Pension Plan and the
BBandT Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan) (collectively, the " _New Benefit
Plans_ ") for the employees covered thereby, which New Benefit Plans will, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, and among other things, (A) treat
similarly situated employees on a substantially equivalent basis, taking into
account all relevant factors, including duties, geographic location, tenure,
qualifications and abilities, and (B) not discriminate between employees who
were covered by BBandT Benefit Plans, on the one hand, and those covered by
SunTrust Benefit Plans, on the other hand, at the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, BBandT and SunTrust agree that, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof,
any continuing employee of BBandT, SunTrust or any of their respective
Subsidiaries who is involuntarily terminated during such one (1)-year period
will be provided with severance as described in Section 6.6(a) of the BBandT
Disclosure Schedule.

 

(b) For purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit accrual
(except not for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan or to the extent that such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits) under the BBandT Benefit Plans, SunTrust Benefit Plans and the New
Benefit Plans, service with or credited by BBandT, SunTrust or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or predecessors for Continuing Employees or
continuing employees of BBandT or its Subsidiaries shall be treated as service
with BBandT to the same extent that such service was taken into account under
the analogous SunTrust Benefit Plan or BBandT Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time. With respect to any SunTrust Benefit Plan, BBandT Benefit Plan
or New Benefit Plan in which any employees of BBandT or SunTrust (or their
Subsidiaries) prior to the Effective Time first become eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time, and in which such employees did
not participate prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall: (i)
waive all preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and
their eligible dependents, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions,
exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous BBandT Benefit
Plan or SunTrust Benefit Plan, as the case may be, and (ii) provide each such
employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time (or, if later, prior to the
time such employee commenced participation in the New Benefit Plan) under a
BBandT Benefit Plan or SunTrust Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such
credit was given under the analogous SunTrust or BBandT Benefit Plan) in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
SunTrust Benefit Plan, BBandT Benefit Plan or New Benefit Plan in which such
employee first become eligible to participate after the Effective Time.
Effective as of the later of January 1, 2020 and thirty (30) days after the
Effective Time and subject to the immediately following sentence, the
Continuing Employees shall become eligible to participate in the BBandT
Corporation Pension Plan and the BBandT Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan on
the same basis as similarly situated employees of BBandT and its Subsidiaries,
except as otherwise mutually agreed by BBandT and SunTrust. For purposes of the
foregoing, the Surviving Entity shall recognize (1) the service with SunTrust
and its Subsidiaries of the Continuing Employees for purposes of eligibility
to participate and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under the BBandT
Corporation Pension Plan and (2) the service of the Continuing Employees who
satisfy the eligibility requirements of the BBandT Non-Qualified Defined Benefit
Plan as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and are designated
by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Surviving
Entity as eligible to participate in such plan for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under the BBandT Non-Qualified
Defined Benefit Plan.

 



-61- 

    

(c) The Surviving Entity agrees to honor in accordance with their terms all
BBandT Benefit Plans and SunTrust Benefit Plans. In addition, prior to the
Effective Time, BBandT may take such action as it deems necessary, including
amending the BBandT Corporation Pension Plan and/or the BBandT Non-Qualified
Defined Benefit Plan, so that (i) each participant in the BBandT Corporation
Pension Plan and BBandT Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be entitled to continued benefit accrual on a basis
no less favorable than in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including as to any rights or features) for so long as such participant
continues as an employee of the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries (or their
respective successors or assigns) and (ii) following the Effective Time, the
BBandT Corporation Pension Plan and BBandT Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan may
not be terminated or amended so as to adversely impact any such participant or
the benefit of any such participant, including any future benefit accruals or
the vesting or entitlement to such future benefit accruals (including any
rights or features of such accruals). Without limiting the foregoing and for
purposes of clarity, any amendment to provide a lump sum cash out of
a participants accrued pension benefit shall be deemed to adversely impact
the participant for purposes of the foregoing clause (ii).

 

(d) If requested by BBandT in writing delivered to SunTrust not less than ten
(10) business days before the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of
SunTrust (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and
take such corporate action as is necessary or appropriate to terminate the
SunTrust Banks, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the " _SunTrust 401(k) Plan_ "), effective
as of the day prior to the Closing Date and contingent upon the occurrence of
the Effective Time. If BBandT requests that the SunTrust 401(k) Plan be
terminated, (i) SunTrust shall provide BBandT with evidence that such plan
has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to
reasonable review and comment by BBandT) not later than two (2) days immediately
preceding the Closing Date and (ii) the Continuing Employees shall be eligible
to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan
sponsored or maintained by BBandT or one of its Subsidiaries (the " _BB andT
401(k) Plan_"), it being agreed that there shall be no gap in participation in
a tax-qualified defined contribution plan. BBandT and SunTrust shall take any
and all actions as may be required, including amendments to the SunTrust
401(k) Plan and/or the BBandT 401(k) Plan, to permit the Continuing Employees to
make rollover contributions to the BBandT 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the
form of cash, notes (in the case of loans), BBandT Common Stock or a combination
thereof in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such
employee from the SunTrust 401(k) Plan.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of BBandT shall take
such action as is necessary to provide that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are deemed a "merger of equals" for purposes of each BBandT
Benefit Plan that provides the Board of Directors of BBandT with the ability to
declare that a particular transaction constitutes a "merger of equals" and
thus does not constitute a "change in control", "change of control" or similar
concept under such BBandT Benefit Plans (which determination shall not be
revoked during the 12-month period following the Effective Time).

 



-62- 

    

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of BBandT or SunTrust or any of their Subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Entity, SunTrust, BBandT or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Entity,
SunTrust, BBandT or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or
terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of
BBandT or SunTrust or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for
any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall
be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any SunTrust Benefit Plan, BBandT
Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the
Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any particular SunTrust Benefit Plan, BBandT Benefit Plan, New
Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of
Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee,
officer, director or consultant of BBandT or SunTrust or any of their
Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall indemnify
and hold harmless and shall advance expenses as incurred, in each case to the
extent (subject to applicable law) such persons are indemnified as of the date
of this Agreement by SunTrust pursuant to the SunTrust Articles, the SunTrust
Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of
SunTrust and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date
hereof and disclosed in Section 6.7(a) of the SunTrust Disclosure Schedule,
each present and former director, officer or employee of SunTrust and its
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the
" _SunTrust Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out
of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of
SunTrust or any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that in the case of
advancement of expenses, any SunTrust Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such SunTrust Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by SunTrust (
_provided_ , that the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at
or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Entity shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in
excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by
SunTrust for such insurance (the

 



-63- 

    

 " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any
time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Entity shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Entitys good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, BBandT or SunTrust, in
consultation with, but only upon the consent of BBandT, may (and at the request
of BBandT, SunTrust shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior
to the Effective Time a six (6)-year "tail" policy under SunTrusts existing
directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to
that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same
may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the
Premium Cap.

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
SunTrust Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the
Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its assets or deposits to any other person or engages in any similar
transaction, then in each such case, the Surviving Entity will cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Entity will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of BBandT, on the one hand,
and a Subsidiary of SunTrust, on the other hand) or to vest the Surviving
Entity with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger or
the Bank Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this
Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by BBandT.

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. BBandT and SunTrust shall each promptly advise the
other party of any effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence
or development (i) that has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it or
(ii) that it believes would or would reasonably be expected to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
obligations, covenants or agreements contained herein that reasonably could be
expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of
a condition in Article VII; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed
to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition
set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a
breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each
case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 6.9 shall not cure any breach of, or noncompliance with, any other
provision of this Agreement or limit the remedies available to the party
receiving such notice.

6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of BBandT and SunTrust
shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of
BBandT Common Stock and SunTrust Common Stock and the record dates and payment
dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto
that holders of

 



-64- 

    

 SunTrust Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive
one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of SunTrust Common
Stock and any shares of BBandT Common Stock any such holder receives in
exchange therefor in the Merger.

6.11 _Shareholder Litigation_. Each party shall give the other party prompt
notice of any shareholder litigation against such party or its directors or
officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
shall give the other party the opportunity to participate (at such
others partys expense) in the defense or settlement of any such litigation.
Each party shall give the other the right to review and comment on all filings
or responses to be made by such party in connection with any such litigation,
and will in good faith take such comments into account. No party shall agree
to settle any such litigation without the other partys prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided_ , that the other party shall not be obligated to consent to any
settlement which does not include a full release of such other party and its
affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief after the
Effective Time upon the Surviving Entity or any of its affiliates.

6.13 _Commitments to the Community_. Following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity will increase the level of philanthropic and community
investment provided by SunTrust in Atlanta, Georgia and by BBandT in Winston-
Salem, North Carolina, respectively, in each case relative to the level of

6.14 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any
negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, have or
participate in any discussions with any person relating to any Acquisition
Proposal or (iv) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
its terms, approve or enter into any term sheet, letter of intent, commitment,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other agreement (whether written or oral, binding or
nonbinding) (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to an entered
into in accordance with this Section 6.14) in connection with or relating to
any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt

 



-66- 

    

 of the Requisite BBandT Vote, in the case or BBandT, or the Requisite SunTrust
Vote, in the case of SunTrust, a party receives an unsolicited _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal, such party may, and may permit its Subsidiaries
and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be
furnished confidential or nonpublic information or data and participate in
such negotiations or discussions with the person making the Acquisition
Proposal if the Board of Directors of such party concludes in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take such
actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ , that, prior to furnishing
any confidential or nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to
this sentence, such party shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement
with the person making such Acquisition Proposal on terms no less favorable to
it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall
not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with such
party. Each party will, and will cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than
SunTrust or BBandT, as applicable, with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Each party will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) advise the other
party following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and
the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the identity
of the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), will provide the
other party with an unredacted copy of any such Acquisition Proposal and any
draft agreements, proposals or other materials received in connection with any
such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, and will keep the other party apprised
of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis,
including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. As
used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, with respect to
BBandT or SunTrust, as applicable, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third-party
indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or
indirect, of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of
a party and its Subsidiaries or twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class
of equity or voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more twenty-five percent (25%)
or more of the consolidated assets of the party, (ii) any tender offer
(including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in such third party beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or
more of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the party, or
(iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
transaction involving a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
consolidated assets of the party.

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a party or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such rules will in
no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules
would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 



-67- 

    

6.15 _Public Announcements_. SunTrust and BBandT agree that the initial press
release with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be
a release mutually agreed to by the parties. Thereafter, each of the parties
agrees that no public release or announcement or statement concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any
party without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (i) as
required by applicable law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
Governmental Entity or stock exchange to which the relevant party is subject,
in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall
consult with the other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time
to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of such issuance or
(ii) for such releases, announcements or statements that are consistent with
other such releases, announcement or statements made after the date of
this Agreement in compliance with this Section 6.15.

6.16 _Change of Method_. SunTrust and BBandT shall be empowered, upon
their mutual agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change
the method or structure of effecting the combination of SunTrust and BBandT
(including the provisions of Article I), if and to the extent they both deem
such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the Exchange Ratio or the
number of shares of BBandT Common Stock received by holders of SunTrust Common
Stock in exchange for each share of SunTrust Common Stock, (ii) adversely
affect the Tax treatment of SunTrusts shareholders or BBandTs shareholders
pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of
SunTrust or BBandT pursuant to this Agreement or (iv) materially impede or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a
timely manner. The Parties agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate
amendment to this Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with
Section 9.1.

6.17 _Restructuring Efforts_. If either SunTrust or BBandT shall have failed to
obtain the Requisite SunTrust Vote or the Requisite BBandT Vote at the duly
convened SunTrust Meeting or BBandT Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment
or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use
its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transactions
provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall have any
obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the amount or kind
of the consideration to be issued to holders of the capital stock of SunTrust
as provided for in this Agreement, in a manner adverse to such party or its
shareholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.17) to its respective
shareholders for approval.

6.18 _Takeover Statutes_. None of SunTrust, BBandT or their respective Boards
of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to
become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps
to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or
hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and

 



-68- 

    

 otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute
on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if
necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover
Statute.

6.19 _Treatment of SunTrust Indebtedness_. Upon the Effective Time, BBandT
shall assume the due and punctual performance and observance of the covenants
to be performed by SunTrust under the indentures set forth on Section 6.19 of
the SunTrust Disclosure Schedule, and the due and punctual payment of the
principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on, the notes governed
thereby. In connection therewith, BBandT and SunTrust shall cooperate and use
reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver any supplemental indentures,
officers certificates or other documents, and the parties hereto shall
cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to provide any opinion of counsel to
the trustee thereof, required to make such assumption effective as of the
Effective Time.

 

6.20 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. SunTrust and BBandT agree
that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain SunTrust Insiders,
both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that SunTrust
Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection
with the conversion of shares of SunTrust Common Stock and SunTrust Preferred
Stock and SunTrust PSU Awards into shares of BBandT Common Stock and New BBandT
Common Stock in the Merger and the conversion of SunTrust Equity Awards
into corresponding BBandT Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that
compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section
6.20. SunTrust shall deliver to BBandT in a reasonably timely fashion prior to
the Effective Time accurate information regarding those officers and
directors of SunTrust subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act (the " _SunTrust Insiders_ "), and the Board of Directors
of BBandT and of SunTrust, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as
such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act),
shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective
Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause (in the case of
SunTrust) any dispositions of SunTrust Common Stock, SunTrust Preferred Stock
or SunTrust Equity Awards by the SunTrust Insiders, and (in the case of BBandT)
any acquisitions of BBandT Common Stock, New BBandT Preferred Stock, or BBandT
Equity Awards by any SunTrust Insiders who, immediately following the Merger,
will be officers or directors of the Surviving Entity subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law.

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Requisite SunTrust Vote
or the Requisite BBandT Vote:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of BBandT and SunTrust;

 

(b) by either BBandT or SunTrust if any Governmental Entity that must grant a
Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the Bank
Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable

 



-72- 

    

 order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint or prohibition
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the
consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the failure to obtain a
Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the obligations, covenants
and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 

(c) by either BBandT or SunTrust if the Merger shall not have been consummated
on or before February 7, 2020 (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the
failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the
obligations, covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; 

(d) by either BBandT or SunTrust ( _provided_ , that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, obligation,
covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a
breach of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements or any of the
representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall
cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of SunTrust, in the
case of a termination by BBandT, or BBandT, in the case of a termination by
SunTrust, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the
aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such
representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by BBandT, or Section 7.3, in the
case of a termination by SunTrust, and which is not cured within forty-five
(45) days following written notice to SunTrust, in the case of a termination
by BBandT, or BBandT, in the case of a termination by SunTrust, or by its nature
or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain

a Recommendation Change or (ii) BBandT or the Board of Directors of BBandT shall
have breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or 6.14 in any material
respect; or

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either BBandT or SunTrust
as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no effect, and none of BBandT, SunTrust, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any
liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(b) (Access
to Information; Confidentiality), Section 6.15 (Public Announcements), this
Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive any termination of this Agreement,
and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, neither BBandT nor SunTrust shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and material breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

 



-73- 

    

(b) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have
been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or
senior management of SunTrust or shall have been made directly to the
shareholders of SunTrust or any person shall have publicly announced (and not
withdrawn at least two (2) business days prior to the SunTrust Meeting) an
Acquisition Proposal, in each case with respect to SunTrust and (A) (x)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either BBandT or SunTrust pursuant
to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite SunTrust Vote having been obtained
(and all other conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 were
satisfied or were capable of being satisfied prior to such termination) or
(y) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by BBandT pursuant to Section 8.1(d)
as a result of a willful breach, and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12)
months after the date of such termination, SunTrust enters into a definitive
agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then
SunTrust shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive
agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay BBandT, by wire
transfer of same-day funds, a fee equal to $1,121,000,000 (the " _Termination
Fee_ "); _provided_ , that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b)(i), all
references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "twenty-five percent
(25%)" shall instead refer to "fifty percent (50%)."

 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by BBandT pursuant to
Section 8.1(f), then SunTrust shall pay BBandT, by wire transfer of same-day
funds, the Termination Fee within two (2) business days of the date of
termination.

(c) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have
been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or
senior management of BBandT or shall have been made directly to the
shareholders of BBandT or any person shall have publicly announced (and not
withdrawn at least two (2) business days prior to the BBandT Meeting) an
Acquisition Proposal, in each case with respect to BBandT and (A) (x)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either BBandT or SunTrust pursuant to
Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite BBandT Vote having been obtained (and all
other conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 were satisfied or
were capable of being satisfied prior to such termination) or (y) thereafter
this Agreement is terminated by SunTrust pursuant to Section 8.1(d) as a
result of a willful breach, and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12)
months after the date of such termination, BBandT enters into a definitive
agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above),
then BBandT shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive
agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay SunTrust the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds; _provided_ , that
for purposes of this Section 8.2(c)(i), all references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to "twenty-five percent (25%)" shall instead refer to
"fifty percent (50%)."

 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by SunTrust pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), then BBandT shall pay SunTrust, by wire transfer of same-day
funds, the Termination Fee within two (2) business days of the date of
termination.

 



-74- 

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages to the extent permitted
herein, in no event shall either party be required to pay the Termination Fee
more than once.

 

(e) Each of BBandT and SunTrust acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if BBandT or SunTrust, as the case may
be, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and,
in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or
any portion thereof, such non-paying party shall pay the costs and
expenses of the other party (including attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit. In addition, if BBandT or SunTrust, as the case may
be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then such
party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to
the "prime rate" published in the Wall Street Journal on the date on which
such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date
that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the
date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full.

claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject
of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such
action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that
the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over
any party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such
action or proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with
Section 9.5.

9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY

TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO

of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in
contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except
as otherwise specifically provided in Section 6.7, this Agreement
(including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended
to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the

 



-78- 

    

 right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations
and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the
parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the
knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the
parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 

9.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate
the Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and
(b) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite
to obtaining equitable relief.

 

9.13 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

9.14 _Confidential Supervisory Information_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no disclosure, representation or warranty shall
be made (or other action taken) pursuant to this Agreement that would involve
the disclosure of confidential supervisory information (including
confidential supervisory information as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 261.2(c) and as
identified in 12 C.F.R. § 309.5(g)(8)) of a Governmental Entity by any party
to this Agreement to the extent prohibited by applicable law. To the extent
legally permissible, appropriate substitute disclosures or actions shall be
made or taken under circumstances in which the limitations of the preceding
sentence apply.

 

9.15 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any 

 



-79- 

    

 signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data
file as a defense to the formation of a contract and each party hereto forever
waives any such defense.

Exhibit A to Bylaw Amendment

 

Section 6.6(c) of the Merger Agreement



     | (c) |

The Surviving Entity agrees to honor in accordance with their terms all BBandT
Benefit Plans and SunTrust Benefit Plans. In addition, prior to the Effective
Time, BBandT may take such action as it deems necessary, including amending the
BBandT Corporation Pension Plan and/or the BBandT Non-Qualified Defined Benefit
Plan, so that (i) each participant in the BBandT Corporation Pension Plan and
BBandT Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be entitled to continued benefit accrual on a basis no less
favorable than in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
as to any rights or features) for so long as such participant continues as an
employee of the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries (or their respective
successors or assigns) and (ii) following the Effective Time, the BBandT
Corporation Pension Plan and BBandT Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan may not
be terminated or amended so as to adversely impact any such participant or the
benefit of any such participant, including any future benefit accruals or the
vesting or entitlement to such future benefit accruals (including any rights
or features of such accruals). Without limiting the foregoing and for purposes
of clarity, any amendment to provide a lump sum cash out of a
participants accrued pension benefit shall be deemed to adversely impact the
participant for purposes of the foregoing clause (ii).
