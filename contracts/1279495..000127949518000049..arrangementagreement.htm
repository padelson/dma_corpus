Any Party in receipt of an Acquisition Proposal or any request (which request

Acquisition Proposal) for non-public information relating to the Receiving
Party or its properties, facilities, books or records, except as in the
circumstances disclosed in writing to Raging River by Baytex prior to the
Agreement Date (the "Receiving Party") shall promptly (and in any event within
24 hours of receipt by such Party) notify the Other Party ("Responding Party")
(at first orally and then in writing) of any Acquisition Proposal (or any
amendment thereto) or any amendments to the foregoing received by the
Receiving Party. Such notice shall include a copy of any written Acquisition
Proposal (and any amendment thereto) or any such request (which request may be
reasonably considered to be in furtherance of, or in relation to, an
Acquisition Proposal) for non-public information relating to the Receiving
Party or its properties, facilities, books or records received by the
Receiving Party or, if no written Acquisition Proposal has been received, a
description of the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
Person making any inquiry, proposal or offer or request (to the extent then
known by the Receiving Party). The Receiving Party shall also provide such
further and other details of the Acquisition Proposal, request or any
amendment thereto as the Responding Party may reasonably request (to the
extent then known by the Receiving Party). The Receiving Party shall keep the
Responding Party fully informed of the status, including any change to
material terms, of any Acquisition Proposal, request or any amendment thereto,
shall respond promptly to all reasonable inquiries by the Responding Party
with respect thereto, and shall provide to the Responding Party copies of all
material correspondence and other written material sent to or provided to the
Receiving Party by any Person in connection with such inquiry, proposal, offer
or request or sent or provided by the Receiving Party to any Person in
connection with such inquiry, proposal, offer or request. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Following receipt of a Superior Proposal, the Receiving Party shall give the
Responding Party, orally and in writing, at least 72 hours advance notice of
any decision by its board of directors to accept, recommend, approve or enter
into an agreement to implement a Superior Proposal, which notice shall (i)
confirm that the board of directors of the Receiving Party has determined that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (ii) identify the
third party making the Superior Proposal; (iii) confirm that the entering into
of a definitive agreement to implement such Superior Proposal is not subject
to any due diligence or access condition; and (iv) confirm that a definitive
agreement to implement such Superior Proposal has been settled between the
Receiving Party and such third party in all material respects (including in
respect of the value and financial terms) and the value ascribed to any non-
cash consideration offered under such Acquisition Proposal, and the Receiving
Party will concurrently provide a true and complete copy thereof, together
with all supporting materials, including any financing documents supplied to
the Receiving Party in connection therewith, and will thereafter promptly
provide any amendments thereto, to the Responding Party. During the 72 hour
period commencing on the delivery of such notice, the Receiving Party agrees
not to accept, recommend, approve or enter into any agreement to implement
such Superior Proposal and not to release the party making the Superior
Proposal from any standstill 

provisions and shall not withdraw, redefine, modify or change the Raging River
Board Recommendation or Baytex Board Recommendation, as applicable. In
addition, during such 72 hour period, the Receiving Party shall, and shall
cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith with the
Responding Party and its financial and legal advisors (subject to the final
sentence of this paragraph) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Arrangement as would enable the Receiving
Party to proceed with the Arrangement, as amended, rather than the Superior
Proposal. In the event the Responding Party confirms in writing its commitment
to amend this Agreement, and the proposed adjustments to the terms and
conditions hereof, to provide a transaction financially superior for the
Receiving Party Shareholders than the Superior Proposal and so advises the
board of directors of the Receiving Party prior to the expiry of such 72 hour
period, the board of directors of the Receiving Party shall review the
proposed adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Arrangement in good faith in order to determine whether such proposed
adjustments would, upon acceptance, result in the Acquisition Proposal
previously constituting a Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal;
and if it so concludes, shall not accept, recommend, approve or enter into any
agreement to implement such Superior Proposal and shall not release the party
making the Superior Proposal from any standstill provisions and shall not
withdraw, redefine, modify or change the Raging River Board Recommendation or
Baytex Board Recommendation, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and
for greater certainty, the Responding Party shall have no obligation to make
or negotiate any changes to this Agreement in the event that the Receiving
Party is in receipt of a Superior Proposal. The Receiving Party acknowledges
that each successive material modification of any Superior Proposal that
results in an increase in the consideration (or the value thereof) to be
received by the Receiving Party\'s shareholders or other material terms or
conditions shall constitute a new Superior Proposal for purposes of the
requirement under this Subsection 3.4(d) to initiate a new 72 hour notice
period.

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

The Baytex Board or the Raging River Board shall reaffirm the Raging River
Board Recommendation or Baytex Board Recommendation, as applicable, by news
release promptly, and in any event within 72 hours of being requested to do so
by the Other Party (or in the event that the Baytex Meeting or Raging River
Meeting to approve the Shares Issuance Resolution or the Arrangement
Resolution, respectively, is scheduled to occur within such 72 hour period,
prior to the scheduled date of such meeting), in the event that (i) any
Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced unless the board of directors of
the Receiving Party has determined that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal in accordance with this Section 3.4; or (ii) the Parties
have entered into an amended agreement pursuant to Subsection 3.4(d) that
results in any Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior Proposal. The
Receiving Party shall provide the Responding Party and its outside legal
counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review the form and content of any
such news release and shall make all reasonable amendments to such news
release as requested by the Responding Party and its counsel. 

| 
---|---

Each of Baytex and Raging River agree that all information that may be
provided to it by the Other Party with respect to any Superior Proposal

The Parties acknowledge and agree that all information provided by Raging

permitted to complete the Pre-Acquisition Reorganization provided that: (a)

and its advisors; (b) such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization does not have the
effect of reducing the consideration to be received under the Arrangement by
any of the Raging River Shareholders; (c) such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization
does not impose any incremental tax obligations on the Raging River
Shareholders in connection with the Arrangement or a Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization; or (d) such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization, in the opinion of
Raging River or its advisors, acting reasonably, will not have a material
adverse effect on Baytex. "Pre-Acquisition Reorganization" means any

operations and assets of the Baytex Group prior to the completion of the
Arrangement.

necessary in connection with its business as it is now being, or proposed to

(taken as a whole) or would significantly impact the ability of Baytex to
consummate the Arrangement, and no member of the Baytex Group has received any
notice of any alleged violation of any such Applicable Laws other than where
such notice would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect

Baytex to consummate the Arrangement.

beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting securities of Baytex, or (iii)

or is entitled to any royalty, net profits interest, carried interest or any
other Encumbrances or claims of any nature whatsoever which are based on
production from the properties or assets of any member of the Baytex Group or
any revenue or rights attributed thereto. 

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

Title. Although it does not warrant title: (i) Baytex does not have reason to
believe that each member of the Baytex Group does not have good and marketable
title to or the right to produce and sell its petroleum, natural gas and
related hydrocarbons and does represent and warrant that such interests are
free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances) created
by, through or under any member of the Baytex Group or those arising in the
ordinary course of business, which are not material in the aggregate, and
Baytex has not received written notice of any default or purported default
under, nor has there been any act or omission by any member of the Baytex
Group that could reasonably constitute a breach of or a default under, the
leases, licenses, permits, concessions, concession agreements, contracts,
subleases, reservations or other agreements in which any member of the Baytex
Group derives its interests in its oil and gas properties that have not been
remedied in all material respects or if unremedied would in the aggregate,
have a material adverse effect on the Baytex Group (taken as a whole); and
(ii) there are no defects, failures or impairments in the title of Baytex to
its assets, whether or not an action, suit, proceeding or inquiry is pending
or threatened in writing or whether or not discovered by any third party,
which in the aggregate, could materially adversely affect: (A) the quantity
and pre-tax net present values of such assets as reflected in the Baytex
Reserves Reports; (B) the current production volumes of Baytex; or (C) the
current cash flow of Baytex. 

| 
---|--- 

(w)

|

Baytex Reserves Reports. Baytex has made available to Sproule and Ryder Scott,
prior to the issuance of the Baytex Reserves Reports for the purpose of
preparing the Baytex Reserves Report, all information requested by Sproule and
Ryder Scott, as applicable, which information did not contain any
misrepresentation at the time such information was provided. Except with
respect to changes in commodity prices, Baytex has no knowledge of a material
adverse change in any production, cost, price, reserves or other relevant
information provided to Sproule and Ryder Scott, as applicable, since the date
that such information was provided. Baytex believes that the Baytex Reserves
Reports reasonably present the quantity and pre-tax net present values of the
crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves attributable to the
properties evaluated in such reports as of the effective date of the reports
based upon information available at the time such reserve information was
prepared, and Baytex believes that, at the date of such reports, such reports
did not (and as of the 

Agreement Date, except as may be attributable to production of the reserves
since the date of such report, such reports do not) overstate the aggregate
quantity or pre-tax net present values of such reserves or the estimated
reserves producible therefrom.

Baytex is not the operator, to Baytex\'s knowledge):

Baytex or the Baytex Shareholders prior to the date of the Baytex Meeting and
(i) remains outstanding at the time of the Baytex Meeting, (ii) the Baytex

---|--- 

(d)

|

Baytex breaches any of the covenants made by it in this Agreement, which
breach, individually or in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be
expected to result in a material adverse change, or to have a material adverse
effect, in respect of Baytex, provided that Raging River shall have given
Baytex written notice of, and five Business Days to cure, any such breach and
such breach shall not have been cured (except that no cure period shall be
provided for a breach that, by its nature, cannot be cured and, in no event,
shall any cure period extend beyond the Outside Date); or 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Baytex breaches any of the representations and warranties made by it in this
Agreement, which breach of such representations and warranties, individually
or in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be expected to result in a
material adverse change, or to have a material adverse effect, in respect of
Baytex, provided that Raging River shall have given Baytex written notice of,
and five Business Days to cure, any such breach and such breach shall not have
been cured (except that no cure period shall be provided for a breach that, by
its nature, cannot be cured and, in no event, shall any cure period extend
beyond the Outside Date); 

(each of the above, if not timely cured, if applicable, or waived by Raging
River, being (upon expiration of the applicable cure period) hereinafter
referred to as a "Raging River Damages Event") provided no Baytex Damages
Event has occurred, Baytex shall pay to Raging River $50 million (the "Raging
River Termination Fee") as liquidated damages, in immediately available funds,
to an account designated by Raging River, within two Business Days after the
occurrence of the first Raging River Damages Event, and after the occurrence
of such Raging River Damages Event, but prior to payment of such amount,
Baytex shall be deemed to hold any amount owing to Raging River under this
Section 6.2 in trust for Raging River. Baytex shall only be obligated to pay
one Raging River Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 6.2.

| 
---|--- 

6.3

|

Liquidated Damages and Specific Performance 

Each of Baytex and Raging River acknowledges that the payment of any amounts
set out in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 is a payment of liquidated damages and
represents a genuine pre-estimate of the damages that Baytex or Raging River
(as applicable) will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to
such damages and the resultant termination of this Agreement and is not a
penalty. Each of Baytex and Raging River irrevocably waives any right it may
have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages payable by it are
excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, Baytex and Raging River agree
that receipt of an amount pursuant to Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 is the sole
monetary remedy of Baytex or Raging River (as applicable) hereunder, provided,
however, that this limitation shall not apply in the event of fraud or wilful
or intentional breach of this Agreement by the Party that has made, or is
required to make, a payment pursuant to this Article 6\. Nothing in this
Article 6 shall preclude Baytex or Raging River from seeking and obtaining
injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants
of the Other Party set out in this Agreement, the Raging River Confidentiality
Agreement and the Baytex Confidentiality Agreement or specific performance of
any of such covenants of the Other Party, without the necessity of posting
bond or security in connection therewith.

ARTICLE 7

the Arrangement.

| 
---|--- 

(c)

by either Baytex or Raging River, if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or prior to the Outside Date, except that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Subsection 8.1(c) shall not be available to any
Party whose failure to fulfill any of its obligations has been the cause of,
or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur by such date; 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

by either Party as provided in Subsection 5.4(b), provided that the failure to
satisfy the particular condition precedent being relied upon as a basis for
termination of this Agreement did not occur as a result of a breach by the
Party seeking to rely on the condition precedent of any of its covenants or
obligations under the Agreement; 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

by Baytex upon the occurrence of a Baytex Damages Event, as provided in

|

by Raging River upon the occurrence of a Raging River Damages Event, as
provided in Section 6.2;

(g)

---|--- 

(h)

|

by Baytex upon the occurrence of a Raging River Damages Event, as set out in
Subsection 6.2(c), and the payment by Baytex to Raging River of the Raging

set out in Section 3.4. 

In the event of the termination of this Agreement in the circumstances set out
in this Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and be of no
further force or effect and no Party shall have any liability or further
obligation to the other hereunder except with respect to the obligations set
out in any of Section 4.3, Article 6, (provided in the case of Sections 6.1
and 6.2, the right of payment (in the case of Subsection 6.1(b) and 6.2(b),
being the public announcement or making of such Acquisition Proposal) arose
prior to the termination of this Agreement); Article 9 and Article 10, all of
which shall survive such termination. For greater certainty, the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to this Article 8 shall not affect the rights or
obligations of any Party under the Raging River Confidentiality Agreement or
the Baytex Confidentiality Agreement and such confidentiality agreements shall
remain in full force and effect, subject to any further agreement of the
Parties.

Unless otherwise provided herein, the exercise by either Party of any right of
termination hereunder shall be without prejudice to any other remedy available
to such Party at law or in equity.
