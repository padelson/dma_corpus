**ARTICLE  II**

 

 

**_EFFECT  OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY AND_**

 

**_MERGER  SUB; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

 

 

2.1 _Effect  of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At  the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part  of any party or the
holder of any of the following securities:

 

 

 

(a) _Capital  Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger
Sub  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be  converted into and shall represent one share of common stock, par value
$0.01  per share, of the Surviving Corporation, so that, after the Effective
Time,  Parent shall be the holder of all of the issued and outstanding shares
of the  Surviving Corporation\'s common stock.

 

 

(b) _Capital  Stock of the Company_.

 

 

(i) Subject  to the other provisions of this _ARTICLE II_ , each share of
common stock of  the Company, par value $1.00 per share (" _Company Common
Stock_ "), issued  and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding any shares  of  Company Common Stock described in clause (ii) of
this _Section 2.1(b)_ and  any Appraisal Shares), including for the avoidance
of doubt any shares of  Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time whose  prior restrictions have lapsed pursuant to _Section
2.4_ shall be converted  into the right to receive $48.00 in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger  Consideration_ "). All such shares of Company Common
Stock, when so  converted, shall cease to be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled  and  cease to exist. Each holder of a certificate
previously representing  any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with  respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger  Consideration.

 

 

(ii) All  shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury
shares or by  Parent or Merger Sub or by any Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company,  in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
automatically be  canceled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time
without any conversion  thereof, and no consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable  therefor.

 

 

(c) _Impact  of Stock Splits, Etc_. In the event of any change in the number
of  shares of Company Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable
into  or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock (including Company
Stock  Options), issued and outstanding between the date of this Agreement
and the  Effective Time by reason of any stock split, stock dividend,
subdivision,  reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of
shares or the  like,  the Merger Consideration to be paid for each share of
Company  Common

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Stock,  the Performance Unit Consideration to be paid for any Performance
Unit, or  the  Option Consideration to be paid for any Company Stock Option,
as the case may  be, as provided in this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide  the  holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by  this  Agreement prior to such action and, as so
adjusted, shall, from and after the  date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration, Performance Unit Consideration  or the Option Consideration,
as the case may be, subject to further adjustment  in accordance with this
_Section 2.1(c)_.


 

2.2 _Appraisal  Rights_. Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock  issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held  by  any record holder (excluding
any shares described in _Section 2.1(b)(ii)_ )  who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant  to, and who complies in
all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of  the  DGCL (the "
_Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to  receive the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ , but  instead, at
the Effective Time, the holders of Appraisal Shares shall become  entitled to
payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the  provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL and at the Effective Time, all Appraisal  Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and  cease
to exist and the holder of such shares shall cease to have any rights  with 
respect thereto, except as set forth in this _Section  2.2_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail  to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal  under Section 262 of the DGCL
or a court of competent jurisdiction shall  determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section  262  of the DGCL, then the right
of such holder to be paid the fair value of such  holder\'s Appraisal Shares
under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be forfeited  and  cease and each of
such holder\'s Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been  converted at
the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to  receive,
without interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. The  Company shall
deliver prompt notice to Parent of any notice received by the  Company of
intent to demand and of any demands received by the Company for  appraisal of
any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such  demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL that are received  by
the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and provide 
Parent with the opportunity to participate in and control all negotiations 
and  proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the  DGCL.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the  prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle  or 
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the  foregoing.

 

 

2.3 _Treatment  of Company Options_.  The  Company agrees that it will take
such actions as are necessary to cause at  the  Effective Time each option
for the purchase of Company Common Stock then  outstanding (" _Company Stock
Option_ "), whether or not exercisable, under  the Company\'s Amended and
Restated 1999 Incentive Plan, the Company's Stock  Option Plan for Non-
Employee Directors, the Millennium Chemicals Inc. Long-Term  Stock Incentive
Plan and the Millennium Chemicals Inc. 2001 Omnibus Incentive  Compensation
Plan (together with the plans listed in _Section 2.4_ , the  " _Company Stock
Plans_ "), to become fully exercisable (if not then fully  exercisable), and
such options shall immediately thereafter be cancelled and  shall
automatically cease to exist, and each holder of Company Stock Options  shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Stock Option except 
the right to receive the following consideration upon delivery of an option 
surrender agreement, which shall

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  in a  form reasonably agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the
Closing  (" _Option Surrender Agreement_ ") in accordance with _Section 
2.6(b)(i)(B)_ : for each share of Company Common Stock subject to  such
Company Stock Option, an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the 
excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration payable in respect of a
share  of  Company Common Stock over (ii) the per share exercise price of
such Company  Stock Option (such amount in cash as described above being
hereinafter referred  to as the " _Option Consideration_ "). Parent and
Merger Sub  acknowledge and agree that the actions described in the preceding
sentence  shall  occur at the Effective Time without any action on the part
of Merger Sub, Parent  or any of their respective stockholders.


 

2.4 _Treatment  of Restricted Company Common Stock_. Immediately  prior to
the Effective Time, the restrictions applicable to each share of  restricted
Company Common Stock (including Company Common Stock underlying  restricted
stock units) issued or granted pursuant to the Company's Non-Employee 
Directors Restricted Stock Plan, the Company's Amended and Restated 1999 
Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Company's 1995 Restricted Stock Plan shall 
immediately lapse, and, at the Effective Time, each share of such Company
Common  Stock, restricted stock units and phantom stock shall be converted
into the  right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the
terms  hereof.

 

 

2.5 _Payment  for Performance Units_. Immediately  prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding grant of performance units or  performance shares ("
_Performance Units_ ") under the Company Stock Plans  shall become fully
vested and payable according to the terms of the Company  Stock Plan and
applicable form of award agreements and shall be converted into  the right to
receive from the Surviving Corporation, for such Performance Unit,  an amount
(subject to any withholding tax) in case equal to the sum of (i)  the 
product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock which the holder 
thereof would have been entitled to receive under the terms of the
Performance  Unit and (B) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the cash portion,
if any, payable  with respect to such Performance Unit (such amount in cash
as described above  being hereinafter referred to as the "Performance Unit 
Consideration").

 

 

2.6 _Payment  for Securities_

 

 

(a) _Paying  Agent; Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub 
shall enter into an agreement with an entity designated by Parent and
reasonably  acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of
Company Common  Stock and holders of the Company Stock Options in connection
with the Merger  (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and to receive the Merger
Consideration, the Option  Consideration and the Performance Unit
Consideration to which such holders  shall  become entitled pursuant to this
_ARTICLE II_. On the Closing  Date and prior to the filing of the Certificate
of Merger, Parent shall deposit,  or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent, for the benefit of the holders  of shares of Company Common Stock, the
Company Stock Options, and the  Performance Units for payment in accordance
with this _ARTICLE II_ through  the Paying Agent, cash in an amount
sufficient to permit payment of the  aggregate Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , the  aggregate Option Consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 2.3_ , and the  aggregate Performance Unit Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 2.5_   (the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying
Agent shall, pursuant to  irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant  to  _Section 2.1_ , the Option Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section  2.3_ , and the Performance Unit

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Consideration  payable pursuant to _Section 2.5_ in each case, out of the
Payment  Fund. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as 
directed by Parent, in short-term obligations of the United States of
America  with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United
States  of  America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America  or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moody\'s  Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s
Corporation, respectively;  provided, however, that any interest or other
income resulting from the  investment of the Payment Fund shall be solely for
the account of Parent or  the  Surviving Corporation. If for any reason
(including losses) the  Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to
which holders of shares of  Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options and
the Performance Units shall  be  entitled under _Section 2.1_ , _Section
2.3_ and _Section 2.5_ ,  respectively, Parent shall take all steps necessary
to enable or cause the  Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit additional
cash with the Paying Agent  sufficient to make all payments required under
this Agreement, and Parent and  the Surviving Corporation shall in any event
be liable for payment  thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
other  purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses  of the Paying Agent in connection with the exchange of shares for
the Merger  Consideration and the cancellation of Company Stock Options for
the Option  Consideration and the calculation and payment of the Performance
Unit  Consideration. Any interest or other income resulting from Investment 
of the Payment Fund shall become part of the Payment Fund.

 

 

(b) _Payment  Procedures_.

 

 

(i) As  soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Paying  Agent to deliver:

 

 

(A) to  each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of
(1) an  outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
the Effective  Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") or  (2) shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry  Shares_ "), a customary letter of transmittal ("
_Letter of Transmittal_ ")  (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and  title  to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates  to  the Paying Agent or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the  procedures set forth in the
Letter of Transmittal, and which shall be in a  customary form and agreed to
by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing)  and  instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in  the  case of Book-
Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the  Merger
Consideration set forth in _Section 2.1(b)(i)_ ;

 

 

(B) to  each holder of a Company Stock Option as of the Effective Time (1) an
Option  Surrender Agreement, and (2) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender  of  such Company Stock Option in exchange for the Option
Consideration;  and

 

 

(C) to  each holder of a Performance Unit as of the Effective Time a notice
setting  forth such holders' rights pursuant to this Agreement.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Upon  surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, together  with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in  accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
customary documents  as  may be reasonably required by the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent,  the  holder of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive  in  exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share formerly represented  by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares and such Certificate or book-entry  shall then be canceled.
No interest shall be paid or accrued for the  benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger  Consideration payable in
respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry  Shares. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to an  individual, partnership, limited liability
company, corporation, joint stock  company, trust, estate, joint venture,
Governmental Entity, association or  unincorporated organization, or any
other form of business or professional  entity (" _Person_ "), other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered  Certificate is registered, it shall be
a condition of payment that the  Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise  in  proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall  have  paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the  Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the  Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the  Surviving Corporation that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not  applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section  2.6(b)(ii)_ , each Certificate and each Book-
Entry Share shall, subject to  _Section 2.2_ , be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent  only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration as  contemplated by this _ARTICLE II_.

 

 

(iii) Upon  cancellation of a Company Stock Option, together with the
delivery of the Option  Surrender Agreement, duly executed, and any other
documents reasonably required  by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, the holder of the Company  Stock Option shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the amount of  cash which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions  of  _Section 2.3_.

 

 

(c) _Termination  of Rights_.

 

 

(i) All  Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of and in exchange for
shares  of  Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to  have  been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to such Company Common  Stock. After the close of business on the date of the
Effective Time,  there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books  of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the  Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than
certificates  evidencing shares described in clause (ii) of _Section 2.1(b)_
) are  presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
canceled  and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares  of  Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificates as provided  in  this _ARTICLE II._

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) The  cancellation of a Company Stock Option in exchange for the Option
Consideration  shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder had
or may have  had  in respect of such Company Stock Option. Prior to the
Effective Time,  the Company shall take all action necessary (including
causing the Board of  Directors of the Company (or any committees thereof) to
take such actions as  are  allowed by the Company Stock Plan) to ensure
that, following the Effective  Time,  without any action required by any
holder of Company Options, (A) no participant  in the Company Stock Plan or
any other plans, programs or arrangements of the  Company shall have any
right thereunder to acquire or otherwise receive any  capital stock of, or
other equity or similar interests in, the Company, the  Surviving Corporation
or any Affiliate (as such term is defined in Rule 405  under the Securities
Act, an " _Affiliate_ ") thereof and (B) the Company  Stock Options may be
cancelled in exchange for the Option Consideration pursuant  to the terms of
this Agreement.

 

 

(iii) The  payment of the Performance Unit Consideration shall be deemed a
release of  any  and all rights the holder had or may have had in respect of
such Performance  Unit.

 

 

(d) _Termination  of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including any  interest thereon) that remains undistributed to the former
stockholders or  optionholders of the Company on the 365th day after the date
on which the  Effective Time occurs shall be delivered to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation,  upon demand by either Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, and any former common  stockholders or optionholders of the
Company who have not theretofore received  the Merger Consideration or Option
Consideration to which they are entitled  under this _ARTICLE II_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving  Corporation and Parent for payment of
their claim for such amounts.

 

 

(e) _No  Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub 
or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock or 
Company Stock Option for any amount of Merger Consideration or Option 
Consideration, as applicable, delivered to a public official pursuant to any 
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any  Certificate,
Book-Entry Share or Company Stock Option has not been surrendered  prior to
the time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger  Consideration
or Option Consideration in respect of such Certificate, Book-Entry  Share or
Company Stock Option would otherwise escheat to or become the property  of
any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions 
in  respect of such Certificate, Book-Entry Share or Company Stock Option
shall,  to  the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of
Parent, free  and  clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled  thereto.

 

 

(f) _Lost,  Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate (other
than  a Certificate evidencing shares described in clause (ii) of _Section 
2.1(b)_ ) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an 
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, 
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Surviving 
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount 
as  Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any
claim  that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent  shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the  amount of Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
number of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shares  of  Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate
pursuant to the  provisions of this _ARTICLE II_.

 

 

(g) _Withholding  Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the 
contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be 
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to 
any  holder of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options or Performance
Units  pursuant to this Agreement any amount required (or reasonably believed
to be  required) to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment  under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so
properly  withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case  may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this  Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common
Stock, Company  Stock Options or Performance Units, as applicable, in respect
of which such  deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the
Surviving  Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on or prior to the date of 
this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") and except as disclosed 
in the Company SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof
(other  than disclosures in "Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"
and "Risk  Factors" sections of such Company SEC Documents and only to the
extent  reasonably apparent in the Company SEC Document that such disclosed
item is  an  event, item or occurrence that relates to the subject matter
of, or would  constitute a breach of a representation or warranty set forth
in this _Section  3.1_ ), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as  follows:

and in good standing to do  business in each jurisdiction in which the
business it is conducting, or the  operation, ownership or leasing of its
properties, makes such qualification  necessary, other than in such

not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in  the  aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The  Company has
heretofore made available to Parent (for purposes of Article III,  items that
have been publicly filed by the Company pursuant to the SEC's "EDGAR  system"
shall be deemed to have been furnished and made available) complete and

any stockholder of the Company  has taken any action to amend the Company
Certificate of Incorporation or the  Company Bylaws in any respect. As used
in this  Agreement: (i) " _Significant Subsidiary_ " means Millennium 
Chemicals Inc., Equistar Chemicals, LP and Houston Refining LP; (ii) a  "
_Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any occurrence, condition,  change,

or in the aggregate, (i) is or is likely to be materially adverse  to the
properties, facilities, assets, liabilities, financial condition,  business
or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken  as  a
whole (taking into account the effects of any material disruption of 
production at a significant facility of the Company for an extended period 
of  time), or (ii) materially impairs, prevents or delays the ability of the
Company  to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby this Agreement or
to perform  its obligations hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event  shall any of the following constitute a Company Material Adverse 
Effect: (A) any occurrence, condition, change, event or effect  resulting
from or relating to changes in general economic or financial market 
conditions, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates; (B) any 
occurrence, condition, change, event or effect that affects the chemical 
industry or refining industry generally (including changes in commodity

constitute a Company Material Adverse  Effect); (D) any changes resulting

the interpretation thereof, as imposed upon the Company,  its Subsidiaries or

brought by any of the current or former stockholders of  the  Company (on
their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) arising out of or  related to
this Agreement or any of the Transactions, (J) any failure by the  Company to
meet projections of revenues or earnings for a period ending after  the date
of this Agreement or (K) any occurrence, condition, change, event  or 
effect resulting from compliance by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
the  terms of this Agreement and each other agreement to be executed and
delivered  in  connection herewith and therewith (collectively, the "
_Transaction  Agreements_ "); except with respect to (A) - (C) and (F), in
the event, and  only to the extent, that such occurrence, condition, change,
event or effect  has  had a disproportionate effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as  a  whole, as compared to other Persons engaged in
the chemical industry or refining  industry in the same geographic regions
and segments as the Company and its  Subsidiaries and except with respect to
(G), (H) and (J), provided that nothing  in any such clauses shall prevent a
determination that any underlying  causes of such changes resulted in a
Company Material Adverse  Effect. " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to any
party, any  corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other

(ii) Each  of the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company
SEC Documents  (including in each case all notes and schedules thereto),
including any Company  SEC Documents filed after the date of this Agreement,
complied or will comply,  as of its respective date, in all material respects
with all applicable  accounting requirements and the rules and regulations of

presented or will fairly present in  all  material respects the financial
position of the Company and its consolidated  Subsidiaries as of their
respective dates and the results of operations and  the  cash flows of the

the Company\'s internal  controls over financial reporting. As of the date

except where the  failure so to hold or the suspension or cancellation of, or
the failure to  be  valid or in full force and effect of, any of the Company
Permits would not  be  reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material  Adverse Effect. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance  with the terms of the Company Permits, except
where the failure so to comply  would not be reasonably likely to have,

the  knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the property
or any  asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) judgment,

outstanding  against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge
of  the Company, as of the date hereof, no officer or director of the Company

for which the 30-day  notice requirement has not been waived has occurred or
is expected to occur  with  respect to any Employee Benefit Plan. No
Employee Benefit Plan is a  "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of
Sections 3(37) of  ERISA).

 

 

(C) All  contributions required to be made to the Employee Benefit Plans and
Foreign  Benefit Plans pursuant to their terms and applicable law have been
timely  made.

 

 

(D) There  are no unfunded benefit obligations under the Employee Benefit
Plans and Foreign  Benefit Plans that have not been properly accrued for in
the Company\'s financial  statements or disclosed in the notes thereto in
accordance with  GAAP.

(E) The  execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not,
and the  consummation of the Merger and compliance with the terms hereof
(whether alone  or in combination with any other event) will not, (1) entitle
any current or  former employee or director or independent contractor of the
Company or any  Subsidiary of the Company to severance pay, (2) except as
expressly required  by  this Agreement, accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or trigger any payment  or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits  under, increase the amount payable or
trigger any other material obligation  pursuant to, any Employee Benefit Plan
or Foreign Benefit Plan, (3) result  in  any breach or violation of, or a
default under, any Employee Benefit Plan or  Foreign Benefit Plan, or (4)
cause any amounts payable under any Employee  Benefit Plan (whether in cash,
in property or in the form of benefits) to fail  to be deductible for federal
income tax purposes by virtue of Sections 162(m)  or  280G of the Code.

 

 

(iii) No  liability under Title IV or section 302 of ERISA has been incurred
by the  Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full,
and no  condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or any
ERISA  Affiliate of incurring any such liability, other than liability for
premiums  due  the PBGC (which premiums have been timely paid when due).
Insofar as  the representation made in this section 3.1(l)(iii) applies to
sections 4064,  4069 or 4204 of Title IV of ERISA, it is made with respect to
any Employee  Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (a " _Title
IV Plan_ ") to  which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate made, or was
required to make,  contributions during the five (5)-year period ending on
the last day of the  most  recent plan year ended prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

(iv) The  PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Title IV Plan
and no  condition has existed prior to the date of this Agreement that
presents a  material risk that such proceedings will be instituted.

 

 

(v) Except  as set forth on _Schedule 3.1(l)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, with  respect to each Title IV Plan, the present value of accrued
benefits under  such  plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for
funding purposes in the  most  recent actuarial report prepared by such
plan\'s actuary with respect to such  plan did not exceed, as of its latest
valuation date, the then current value  of  the assets of such plan
allocable to such accrued benefits.

 

 

(vi) Neither  the Company, any ERISA Affiliate, or Employee Benefit Plan, any
trust  created thereunder, nor any trustee, fiduciary or administrator
thereof has  engaged in or had knowledge of a transaction in connection with
which the  Company, any ERISA Affiliate, any Employee Benefit Plan, or any
such trust  could  be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to
section 409 or 502(i)  of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to section 4975 or
4976 of the  Code.

 

 

(vii) Each  Employee Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of section  401(a) of the Code is so qualified and the trusts
maintained thereunder are  exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the
Code. Each  Employee

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Benefit  Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) has
satisfied  such requirements.

 

 

(viii) Except  as set forth on _Schedule 3.1(l)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, no  Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan provides medical,
surgical,  hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not
insured) for  employees or former employees of the Company or any Subsidiary
for periods  extending beyond their retirement or other termination of
service, other than  (i) coverage mandated by applicable law, (ii) death
benefits under any "pension  plan," or (iii) benefits the full cost of which
is borne by the current or  former employee (or beneficiary thereof).

 

 

(ix) None  of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has (i) used the
services or workers  provided by third party contract labor suppliers,
temporary employees, "leased  employees" (as that term is defined in Section
414(n) of the Code), or  individuals who have provided services as
independent contractors to an extent  that would reasonably be expected to
result in the disqualification of any  of  the Employee Benefit Plans or the
imposition of penalties or excise taxes with  respect to the Employee Benefit
Plans by the IRS, the Department of Labor,  or  the PBGC.

 

 

(x)   Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan"  (as defined under Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has
been operated and  administered in good faith compliance with Section 409A of
the Code from the  period beginning January 1, 2005. There are no agreements
in place  that would entitle any participant in any such plan to
reimbursement for any  additional tax imposed by Section 409A of the Code.

 

 

(xi) With  respect to the Foreign Benefit Plans, (i) the Foreign Benefit
Plans have been  maintained in all material respects in accordance with their
terms and all  applicable laws (including, but not limited to, all tax laws,
regulations and  the European Union cross-border membership rules), (ii) if
intended to qualify  for special Tax treatment, the Foreign Benefit Plans
meet the requirements  for  such treatment in all material respects, (iii)
if intended to be book-reserved,  the Foreign Benefit Plans are fully book
reserved in all material respects  based  upon reasonable US GAAP actuarial
assumptions and methodology and fully reflect  the financial effects of all
prior transactions in relation to the book reserved  Foreign Benefit Plans,
except where failure to reserve would not be material,  (iv) if intended to
be funded, the Foreign Benefit Plans are either fully funded  or any
shortfall is fully recognized as a book reserve in all material respects, 
based upon reasonable US GAAP actuarial assumptions and methodology and
fully  reflect the financial effects of all prior transactions in relation to
the  funded Foreign Benefit Plans, except where failure to reserve would not
be  material, (v) there are no undisclosed outstanding disputes with respect
to  any  Foreign Benefit Plan and (vi) no liability which could be material
to the  Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, exists or reasonably
could  be  imposed upon the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
by reason  of  such Foreign Benefit Plans (including, but not limited to any
post-sale  liabilities relating to any divestiture in the United Kingdom,
including  disputes and contribution notices from the Pensions Regulator),
other than  to  the extent reflected on the financial statements.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(m) _Labor  Matters_.

 

 

(i) The  third and fourth sentences under the caption "Employee Relations" in

2006  regarding labor unions are true and correct in all material  respects.

 

 

(ii) There  are no pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
strikes, labor  disputes, walkouts, slowdowns, work stoppages or lockouts
against or involving  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

day period  prior  to the date of this Agreement, have been in compliance
with all notice and  other  requirements under the Workers\' Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act  (the  " _WARN Act_ ") and any similar foreign,
state or local law, ordinance or  regulation of any Governmental Entity
relating to plant closings and  layoffs. _Schedule 3.1(m)(iii)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter  sets forth a true and complete chart, as of the
date of this Agreement, listing  any and all plant closings and mass layoffs,
as such terms are defined under  the  WARN Act or any similar foreign, state
or local law, ordinance or regulation,  by  location, which the Company or
its Subsidiaries will implement or anticipate  implementing in the ninety
days prior to the Closing Date, which chart shall  be  updated by the
Company through and until the Closing Date.

 

 

(iv) The  Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable are in material
compliance  with Executive Order 11246.

 

 

(v) To  the Company\'s knowledge, no officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries is in  any  material respect in violation of any term of any
employment agreement,  nondisclosure agreement, common law nondisclosure
obligation, fiduciary duty,  noncompetition agreement, restrictive covenant
or other obligation to a former  employer of any such employee relating (A)
to the right of any such employee  to  be employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or (B) to the knowledge or use  of  trade secrets or
proprietary information, except for such violations as would  not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(n) _Intellectual  Property_. The Company and its Subsidiaries own or have
the  sufficient right to use and after the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement will have the sufficient right to use,
pursuant  to a license or otherwise, all Intellectual Property necessary for
the operation  of the businesses of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as presently  conducted (collectively, the " _Company Intellectual Property_
") free and  clear of all Encumbrances except for Permitted Encumbrances,
except where the  failure to own or have the right to use such Intellectual
Property would not  be  reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material  Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the
Company, the operation of the  business of each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as presently conducted  does  not infringe upon, violate, or
misappropriate any Intellectual  Property right of any other Person, except
for such matters that would not  be  reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material  Adverse Effect. " _Intellectual
Property_ " means all of the following  whether arising under the Laws of the
United States or of any other

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction:  (a) patents, patent applications (including patents issued
thereon) and  statutory invention registrations, including reissues,
divisions, continuations,  continuations in part, extensions and
reexaminations thereof, and all rights  therein provided by international

names, trade dress, logos and other  identifiers of source, including all

registrations and applications for registration  thereof, all rights therein
provided by international treaties or conventions,  and all renewals of any
of the foregoing, (c) Internet domain names, (d)  copyrightable works,

Company  and its Subsidiaries (A) have good, valid and marketable title to
all of the  personal properties and assets, tangible and intangible, that
they purport  to  own, and valid leasehold interests in all of the personal
properties and assets,  tangible and intangible (other than Intellectual
Property), that they purport  to  lease, in each case including the personal
properties and assets reflected  in  the Company\'s consolidated balance
sheet included in the Annual Report, but  excluding any personal property or
assets that are no longer used or useful  for  the conduct of the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently  conducted or that have been
disposed of in the ordinary course of business  since  December 31, 2006.
All such properties and assets are free and clear  of all Encumbrances,
except for (i) routine statutory liens securing liabilities  not yet due and
payable, or the validly or amount of which is being contested  in  good
faith (ii) minor Encumbrances that do not materially detract from the 
value  of the specific asset affected or the present use of such asset,
(iii)  Encumbrances existing or expressly permitted pursuant to credit

as of the date  of  this Agreement or refinancings or Encumbrances permitted

(B) have  such ownership or such rights by license, lease or other agreement
to all  material equipment used or necessary to conduct their respective
businesses  as  currently conducted.

 

 

(p) _Environmental  Matters_.

 

 

(i) As  used in this Agreement:

 

 

(A) " _Environmental  Laws_ " means any and all laws, statutes, regulations,
rules, orders,  ordinances, legally enforceable directives, and rules of
common law of any  Governmental Entity pertaining to protection of human
safety and health (to  the  extent relating to exposure to Hazardous
Materials) or the environment  (including, without limitation, any natural
resource damages or any generation,  manufacture, use, storage, treatment,
disposal, release, threatened release,  discharge, or emission of Hazardous
Materials into the indoor or outdoor  environment) in effect as of the date
hereof;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23

(A) The  Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective operations and
assets are  and,  during the relevant time periods specified under all
applicable statutes of  limitations, have been in compliance with
Environmental Laws, and there are  no  facts or circumstances known to the
Company which could reasonably be expected  to form the basis of any
liability under Environmental Laws against the Company,  its Subsidiaries, or
any person or entity whose liability the Company or its  Subsidiaries likely
has retained or assumed;

 

 

(B) As  of the date of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries are
not subject  to any pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened
claims, actions,  suits, investigations, inquiries or proceedings under
Environmental Laws;  and

 

 

(C) There  have been no Releases of Hazardous Materials at any property
currently or,  to  the knowledge of the Company, formerly owned or operated
by the Company, any  of  its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, by any predecessors  of  the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, which Releases are reasonably  likely to result in material
liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  under Environmental Law,
and, as of the date of this Agreement, neither the  Company nor its
Subsidiaries have received any notice asserting an alleged  liability or
obligation under any Environmental Laws with respect to the  investigation,
remediation, removal, or monitoring of the Release of any  Hazardous
Materials or the threatened Release of any Hazardous Materials at  or  from
any property whether or not currently or formerly owned or operated by  the 
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Subsidiaries  that are customary in all material respects for companies of
similar size in  the  industry and locales in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries operate. Except  as would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, all premiums payable under  the insurance policies have been duly
paid to date. Except as would  not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no
written notice of cancellation  or  termination has been received with
respect to such insurance  policy. There is no material claim by the Company
or any of its  Subsidiaries pending, under any insurance policy and no
material claim made  since January 1, 2006 has been denied.

 

 

(r) _Opinion  of Financial Advisors_. The Board of Directors of the Company
has  received the opinion of Deutsche Bank to the effect that, as of the date
of  this  Agreement, the Merger Consideration to be received by the
shareholders of  Company Common Stock is fair, from a financial point of
view, to such  holders.

 

 

(s) _Vote  Required_. The affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) in favor 
of the adoption of this Agreement of the holders of a majority of the 
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon is the 
only  vote of the holders of any class or series of the Company\'s capital
stock  necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger.

 

 

(t) _Brokers_. Except  for the fees and expenses payable to Deutsche Bank
(which amounts have been  disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof), no
broker, investment banker,  or  other Person is entitled to any broker\'s,
finder\'s or other similar fee or  commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made  by  or on behalf of the Company.

 

 

(u) _Certain  Contracts and Arrangements_. _Schedule 3.1(u)_ of the Company 
Disclosure Letter, together with the lists of exhibits contained in the
Company  SEC Documents, sets forth a true and complete list, as of the date
of this  Agreement, of: (i) each agreement to which the Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries is a party (other than this Agreement) that is of a type
that  would  be required to be included as an exhibit to a Registration
Statement on Form  S-1  pursuant to Items 601(b)(2), (4), (9) or (10) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC  if  such a registration statement was filed by
the Company on the date of this  Agreement; (ii) any agreement that contains
covenants that limit the ability  of  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to compete in a material line of business  of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for any such contract that  may  be cancelled without
any material penalty or other material liability to the  Company or any of
its Subsidiaries upon notice of 60 days or less; (iii) any  contract or
agreement relating to the borrowing of money or extension of credit  pursuant
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has a borrowing  capacity of
more than $100 million or outstanding indebtedness of more than  $100 
million; (iv) interest rate or currency hedging agreements, in each case in 
connection with which the aggregate actual or contingent obligations of the 
Company and its Subsidiaries under such contract are greater than $30
million;  and (v) any contract entered into after January 1, 2007 or not yet
consummated,  in each case for the acquisition or disposition, directly or
indirectly (by  merger or otherwise), of businesses or capital stock or other
equity interests  of another Person for aggregate consideration under such
contract in excess  of  $30 million, but excluding for purposes of this
clause (vi) any supply or sales  contracts; (vii) any contract pursuant to
which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries is burdened from continuing
indemnification or other contingent  payment obligations related to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

environmental  matters, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to
result in payments  in excess of $20 million in any calendar year
(collectively, the " _Company  Contracts_ "). Except as would not be
reasonably likely to have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, neither  the  Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is in breach or default under any Company  Contract nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, is any other party to any such  Company Contract in breach or
default thereunder.

 

 

(v) _State  Takeover Statutes_. No "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share  acquisition," "interested stockholder," "business combination", anti-
takeover  or  other similar statute, rule or regulation enacted under state
or federal laws  in  the United States (with the exception of Section 203 of
the DGCL (" _Section  203_ ")) applicable to the Company is applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger  or any of the other Transactions. Assuming the
accuracy of the  representations made in _Section 3.2(h)_ , the action of the
Board of  Directors of the Company in approving this Agreement is sufficient
to render  inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger, and the other
Transactions the  restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined in
Section 203) as set  forth  in Section 203.

 

 

(w) _Real  Property_. The Company and its Subsidiaries have good, valid and 
defensible title to all material real property owned by the Company or any 
of  its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Owned Real Property_ ")and valid 
leasehold estates in all material real property leased or subleased to the 
Company or its Subsidiaries (" _Material Leased Real Property_ ") free and 
clear of all Encumbrances, except Permitted Encumbrances, except as would
not  be  reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material  Adverse Effect. Except as would not have a Company Material
Adverse  Effect, each agreement under which the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company  is the tenant, subtenant, or occupant with respect to the
Material Leased Real  Property (each, a " _Material Real Property Lease_ ")
to the knowledge of the  Company is in full force and effect and is valid and
enforceable against the  parties thereto in accordance with its terms,
subject, as to enforceability,  to  bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws of general  applicability relating to or affecting
creditors\' rights and to general  principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered  in  a proceeding in equity or at
law), and neither the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries, or to the
knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto,  has  received written
notice of any default under any Material Real Property  Lease.

 

 

(x) _Related  Party Transactions_. Neither the Company nor any of its 
Significant Subsidiaries is a party to any transactions with related parties 
requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission rules and regulations that either (i) have not
previously  been disclosed in the Company SEC Documents or (ii) if not
disclosed, are  materially different from related party transactions
previously disclosed in  the  Company SEC Documents.

 

 

(y) _Rights  Agreement_. The Board of Directors of the Company has amended
the  Rights Agreement (the " _Rights Agreement Amendment_ ") in accordance
with  its terms to render it inapplicable to the Transactions. The Company 
has delivered to Parent a true and correct copy of the Rights Agreement 
Amendment.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 


 

3.2 _Representations  and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_. Except  as
set forth on the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this Agreement 
and  delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company on or prior to the
date of  this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ "), Parent and
Merger Sub  jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as 
follows:

 

 

(a) _Organization,  Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is
duly  organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
its  jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has all requisite
corporate  power  and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
to carry on its  business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified and
in good standing  to  do business in each jurisdiction in which the business
it is conducting, or  the  operation, ownership or leasing of its
properties, makes such qualification  necessary, other than where the failure
to be duly organized, validly existing,  or so to qualify or be in good
standing would not be reasonably likely to have,  individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as defined  below). Parent and
Merger Sub each has heretofore made available to  the Company complete and
correct copies of its principle organizational  documents. " _Parent Material
Adverse Effect_ " means any  occurrence, circumstance, condition, change,
event or effect that prevents  or  materially delays or impairs or is
reasonably likely to prevent or materially  delay or impair the ability of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the  Transactions.

 

 

(b) _Authority;  No Violations, Consents and Approvals_.

 

 

(i) Each  of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to  execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the 
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent  and
Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions 
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of 
each  of Parent and Merger Sub (other than the adoption of this Agreement by
Parent  as  sole stockholder of Merger Sub, which shall occur immediately
after the  execution and delivery of this Agreement). This Agreement has
been  duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub, and,
assuming  this  Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
the Company,  constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent
and Merger Sub  enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject as to
enforceability, to  bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws of general  applicability relating to or affecting creditors\'
rights and to general  principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered  in  a proceeding in equity or at law). Parent,
as the owner of all of the  outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger
Sub, will immediately after the  execution and delivery of this Agreement
adopt this Agreement in its capacity  as  sole stockholder of Merger Sub.

 

 

(ii) The  execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of  the  Transactions will not result in any violation of, or
default (with or without  notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or
acceleration of any material  obligation or the loss of a material benefit
under, or result in the creation  of  any Encumbrance upon any of the
properties or assets of Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries under any
provision of (A) the principle organizational documents  of Parent or Merger
Sub or any provision of the comparable charter or  organizational documents
of any of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  respective Subsidiaries, (B) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage,  indenture, lease or other agreement, permit, franchise or license
to which  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or
Merger Sub  or  any of their respective Subsidiaries or their respective
properties or assets  are bound or (C) assuming the consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations,  registrations, filings, or permits referred to in
_Section 3.2(b)(iii)_ are  duly and timely obtained or made, any judgment,
order, decree, statute, law,  ordinance, rule or regulation of any
Governmental Entity applicable to Parent  or  any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties or assets, other  than, in the case of clauses
(B) and (C), any such violations, defaults,  acceleration, losses or
Encumbrances that would not be reasonably likely to  have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

(iii) No  consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, or
filing with,  or permit from, any Governmental Entity is required to be
obtained or made  by  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the execution and delivery  of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub or the
consummation by Parent and  Merger Sub of the Transactions, including the
Financing, except for: (A) the  filing with the SEC of such reports under
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act  and  such other compliance with the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations  thereunder as may be required in
connection with this Agreement and the  Transactions; (B) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Office of  the  Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware; (C) such filings and approvals  as  may be required by
any foreign premerger notification or competition,  securities, corporate or
other law, rule or regulation of any Governmental  Entity; and (D) any such
consent, approval, order, authorization, registration,  filing, or permit
that the failure to obtain or would not be reasonably likely  to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

(c) _Information  Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by  Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will,  at the date mailed to stockholders of the Company or at the
time of the meeting  of such stockholders to be held in connection with the
Merger, contain any  untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required  to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein,  in  light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not  misleading. The Proxy Statement, insofar as it relates to the
Parent  or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or other information supplied by
the Parent  for inclusion therein, in the form mailed to stockholders will
comply as to  form  in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules  and regulations thereunder.

 

 

(d) _Litigation_. There  are no suits, claim, actions, proceedings,
arbitrations or mediations pending  or, to the knowledge of Parent,

sufficient immediately  available funds available and the financial ability
to permit Parent and Merger  Sub to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration,
the aggregate Option  Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of debt of
the Company and any  Subsidiary of the Company, account receivable facilities
and hedging agreements  and the Company Convertible Notes necessary in
connection with or as a result  of  the Transactions and fees and expenses
of Parent, Merger Sub and their  respective Representatives incurred in
connection with the Transactions and  (ii)  at the Effective Time, will have
the resources and capabilities (financial  and  otherwise) to perform its
obligations hereunder. True, correct and  complete copies of the debt
commitment letter dated the date of this Agreement  from Citigroup Global
Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs International, Goldman Sachs  Credit Partners
L.P., Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner and Smith Incorporated and  Merrill Lynch
Capital Corporation (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), subject  to the terms
and conditions set forth therein have been provided to the  Company. The Debt

Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs International, Goldman  Sachs Credit Partners
L.P., Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner and Smith Incorporated  and Merrill Lynch
Capital Corporation and, when executed by Parent and Merger  Sub, which will

be valid and enforceable against the parties thereto in  accordance with its
terms, subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy,  insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general applicability  relating
to or affecting creditors\' rights and to general principles of equity

equity or at law). The obligations of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,  Goldman
Sachs International, Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., Merrill Lynch 
Pierce Fenner and Smith Incorporated and Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation to 
fund the commitment under the Debt Commitment Letter are not subject to any 
conditions other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As  of the
date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred 
that (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) would constitute a
breach  or default under the Debt Commitment Letter by Parent or Merger 
Sub. Parent has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances that are 
reasonably likely to result in (i) any of the conditions set forth in the
Debt  Commitment Letter not being satisfied or (ii) the funding contemplated
in the  Debt Commitment Letter not being made available to Parent on a timely
basis  in  order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any  repayment or refinancing of debt, account receivable

Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material 
respects, at and immediately after the Effective Time, and after giving
effect  to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, the
Surviving  Corporation (i) will be solvent (in that both the fair value of
its assets  will  not be less than the sum of its debts and that the present
fair saleable value  of its assets will not be less than the amount required
to pay its probable  liability on its debts as they become absolute and
matured); (ii) will have  adequate capital and liquidity with which to engage
in its business; and (iii)  will not have incurred debts beyond its ability
to pay as they become absolute  and matured.

or  series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement
or  the  Merger or the other Transactions. The vote or consent of Parent
as  the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which will be obtained immediately
after  the  execution and delivery of this Agreement) is the only vote or
consent of the  holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub
necessary to  approve and adopt this Agreement, the Merger or the other 
Transactions.

 

 

(h) _Ownership  of Company Common Stock_. Except as set forth on _Schedule

and  correct copy of its consolidated financial statements, including all
notes  and  schedules thereto, for each fiscal quarter and year ended since
August 1, 2005  (the " _Parent Financial Statements_ "). The Parent

periods involved (except  as  may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
fairly present in all material  respects the financial position of Parent and
its consolidated Subsidiaries  as  of their respective dates and the results
of operations and the cash flows  of  Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the periods presented therein,  except that any interim

(e) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company\'s Board of Directors  or  any committee thereof shall be permitted,
at any time prior to obtaining the  Company Required Vote, other than in
connection with a Takeover Proposal, to  make an Adverse Recommendation
Change, but only if prior to taking any such  action, the Board of Directors

consultation with outside legal counsel) that  failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties  under applicable law and the
Company has given three (3) Business Day advance  notice to Parent that the
Company intends to take such action.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
factually accurate public  statement by the Company that describes the
Company\'s receipt of a Takeover  Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto, shall not  be  deemed to be a recommendation

the recommendation of the Company\'s Board of  Directors in favor of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37

such  statement shall be issued without prior notice to Parent and only when
such  statement is required to be issued under applicable law (in the good
faith  judgment of the Company's Board of Directors in consultation with its
legal  counsel).

 

 

(g) Any  action pursuant to this _Section 4.2(a)_ , _(b)_ , _(c)_ ,  _(d)_ ,

consolidated net revenue or earnings  before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization for the preceding twelve  months, or (ii) 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,  (b) any tender offer or exchange

similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to which any Third Party

entity  in  a merger or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the
Company or such  surviving entity, other than, in each case, the transactions
contemplated by  this Agreement. " _Company Required Vote_ " shall mean the
affirmative vote  of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares in
favor of adoption  of  this Agreement. " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean
any bona fide Takeover  Proposal that if consummated would result in a Third
Party (or the shareholders  of any Third Party) owning, directly or
indirectly, (a) more than 50% of the  voting capital stock of the Company or
of the surviving entity in a merger  or  the resulting direct or indirect
parent of the Company or such surviving entity  or (b) assets of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that generated 50%  or  more of the Company\'s
consolidated net revenue or earnings before interest,  taxes, depreciation

the Company\'s Board of Directors or a committee thereof  determines (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel  and after
taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory, estimated timing  of
consummation and other aspects of such proposal and the Third Party making 
such proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines to be 
relevant) would, if consummated in accordance with its terms, result in a 
transaction more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders than the Merger.  "
_Third Party_ " shall mean any Person or group (as defined in Section 
13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than Parent, Merger Sub or any
Affiliates  thereof.

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) Each  of the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in the
preparation  of  the Proxy Statement (including the preliminary Proxy
Statement) and any  amendment or supplement to the preliminary Proxy
Statement. The  Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC as
promptly as reasonably  practicable a preliminary Proxy Statement (and in any
event no later than 30  days following the date of this Agreement);
_provided_ , _however_ ,  that the Company shall furnish such preliminary
Proxy Statement to Parent and  give Parent and its legal counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review such  preliminary Proxy Statement prior to filing with
the SEC and shall cooperate  with Parent with respect to additions, deletions
or changes suggested by Parent  in connection therewith. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent of  the receipt of any comments of the SEC staff with
respect to the preliminary  Proxy Statement and of any requests by the SEC
for any amendment or supplement  thereto or for additional information and
shall provide to Parent, as promptly  as reasonably practicable, copies of
all written correspondence between the  Company or any representative of the
Company and the SEC with respect to the  Proxy Statement. If comments are
received from the SEC staff with  respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement,
the Company shall use its reasonable  best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to the comments  of  the SEC. The Company will
promptly supply Parent with copies of all  correspondence between the Company
or any of its Representatives, on the one  hand, and the SEC or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect  to  the Proxy Statement or the
Merger. The Company shall provide Parent  and its legal counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to review any amendment  or  supplement to each of
the preliminary and the definitive Proxy Statement prior  to filing with the
SEC and shall cooperate with Parent with respect to  additions, deletions or
changes suggested by Parent in connection  therewith. Parent shall promptly
provide the Company with such  information as may be required to be included
in the Proxy Statement or as  may  be reasonably required to respond to any
comment of the SEC  staff. After all the comments received from the SEC have
been cleared  by the SEC staff and all information required to be contained
in the Proxy  Statement has been included therein by the Company, the Company
shall promptly  file the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause
the Proxy Statement  to be mailed (including by electronic delivery if
permitted) as promptly as  practicable, to its stockholders of record, as of
the record date established  by  the Board of Directors of the Company.

 

 

5.2 _Access  to Information_. The  Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent  and  its officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, agents, legal  counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives (collectively, the  " _Representatives_
"), during the period prior to the earlier of the  Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms  of  _Section 7.1_ of
this Agreement, reasonable access, at reasonable times  upon reasonable prior
notice, to the officers, key employees, agents,  properties, offices and
other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries  and  to their books,
records, contracts and documents and shall, and shall cause  each  of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to the Parent and its 
Representatives such information concerning the Company\'s and its
Subsidiaries\'  business, properties, contracts, records and personnel as may
be reasonably  requested, from time to time, by or on behalf of the Parent;
_provided_ ,  that any such access pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ shall be
coordinated  through one of the individuals listed on _Schedule 5.2_ of the
Company  Disclosure Letter. Parent and its Representatives shall conduct
any  such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the  business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise
cause  any  unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge
by the employees  of the Company and its Subsidiaries of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this 
_Section 5.2_ , the Company shall not be required to, or to cause any of its 
Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information to Parent or any of its 
Representatives to the extent that such information is subject to an 
attorney/client or attorney work product privilege or that such access or
the  furnishing of such information is prohibited by law or an existing
contract  or  agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties shall
use  reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to
permit  reasonable disclosure under such circumstances. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, Parent shall not have access to personnel records of the Company 
or  any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or
evaluation  records, medical histories or other information that in the
Company\'s good  faith  opinion on the advice of outside counsel the
disclosure of which could subject  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
risk of liability. Parent  agrees that it will not, and will cause its
Representatives not to, use any  information obtained pursuant to this
_Section 5.2_ for any purpose  unrelated to the consummation of the
Transactions. The  Confidentiality Agreement dated as of July 12, 2007
between Parent and the  Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall
survive the execution and  delivery of this Agreement and, subject to
_Section 7.2_ , shall apply to  all information furnished thereunder or
hereunder.


 

5.3 _Stockholders\'  Meeting and Board Recommendation_. The  Company shall
call, hold and convene a meeting of its stockholders to consider  the
adoption of this Agreement, to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable 
after the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company\'s stockholders (and 
in  any event no later than 45 days after the mailing of the Proxy
Statement),  and  the Company\'s obligation to call, hold, and convene such
meeting in accordance  with this _Section 5.3_ shall not be affected by the
withdrawal, amendment,  or modification of the recommendation by the Board of
Directors of the Company  that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor
of adoption of this  Agreement, unless the Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _ARTICLE VII_.  Subject to _Section 4.2(b) and (e)_ , (i) the Board of
Directors of the  Company shall recommend that the stockholders of the
Company vote in favor  of  the adoption of this Agreement at the Company\'s
stockholders\' meeting and the  Board of Directors of the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to  solicit from stockholders of the Company
proxies in favor of the adoption of  this Agreement and (ii) the Proxy
Statement shall include a statement to the  effect that the Board of
Directors of the Company has recommended that the  Company\'s stockholders
vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the  Company\'s stockholders\'
meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the  Company\'s stockholders\'
meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any  required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the  Company\'s stockholders
or, if as of the time for which the Company\'s  stockholders\' meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy  Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented  (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct  business at such
meeting; _provided_ that no adjournment may be to a date  on or after three
(3) Business Days prior to the date set forth in _Section  7.1(b)(ii)_.

 

 

5.4 _Regulatory  Approvals_

 

 

(a) Except  for the filings and notifications made pursuant to the Premerger
Notification  Rules (as defined below) or other applicable Antitrust Laws (as
defined below)  to which _Section 5.4(b)_ , and not this _Section 5.4(a)_ ,
shall apply,  promptly following the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

execution  of this Agreement, the parties shall proceed to prepare and file
with the  appropriate Governmental Entities all authorizations, consents,
notifications,  certifications, registrations, declarations and filings that
are necessary  in  order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall  diligently and expeditiously prosecute, and shall
cooperate fully with each  other in the prosecution of, such matters.

 

 

(b) As  promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than 60
calendar  days  (assuming the parties to this Agreement have received from
the other party  all  the information required to make all of their
premerger notification filings),  following the execution of this Agreement
the parties shall make all premerger  notification filings pursuant to the
pre-merger notification rules (the  " _Premerger Notification Rules_ "). Each
of Parent and the  Company shall (i) cooperate fully with each other and
shall furnish to the  other  such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may reasonably  request in connection with its
preparation of any filings under any Premerger  Notification Rules; (ii) keep
the other party reasonably informed of any  communication received by such
party from, or given by such party to any  Antitrust Authority, and of any
communication received or given in connection  with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding the Merger and  in  a manner that
protects attorney-client or attorney work product privilege;  and  (iii)
permit the other party to review and incorporate the other party\'s 
reasonable comments in any communication given by it to any Antitrust
Authority  or in connection with any proceeding by a private party related to
Antitrust  Laws with any other Person, in each case regarding the Merger and
in a manner  that protects attorney-client or attorney work product 
privilege. Unless otherwise agreed and without limiting the  obligations
stated in this _Section 5.4(b)_ , Parent and the Company shall  each use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure the prompt expiration of any  applicable
waiting period under any Premerger Notification Rules or approval  by  the
relevant Antitrust Authority. Further, without limiting the  obligations
stated in this _Section 5.4(b)_ , Parent and the Company shall  each use its
reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply with any request  for
information regarding the Merger or filings under any Premerger Notification 
Rules from any Governmental Entity charged with enforcing, applying, 
administering, or investigating any statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation  designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the
purpose or effect  of  monopolization, restraining trade or abusing a
dominant position (collectively,  " _Antitrust Laws_ "), including the
European Commission or any other  competition authority of any jurisdiction
(" _Antitrust  Authority_ "). Parent shall be entitled to direct any
proceedings  or negotiations with any Antitrust Authority or other Person
relating to the  foregoing Merger or filings under any Premerger Notification
Rules,  _provided_ that it shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity
to  participate therein. Neither party shall initiate any meeting or 
discussion with any Governmental Entity with respect to any filings, 
applications, investigation, or other inquiry regarding the Merger or
filings  under any Premerger Notification Rules without giving the other
party reasonable  prior notice of the meeting or discussion and, to the
extent permitted by the  relevant Governmental Entity, the opportunity to
attend and participate (which,  at the request of either party, shall be
limited to outside antitrust counsel  only); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not initiate any  offer to any Governmental Entity with
respect to any proposed Divestiture  Action. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, Parent shall  take any and all action necessary, including
but not limited to (i) selling  or otherwise disposing of, or holding
separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise  dispose of, assets, categories of
assets or businesses of the Company or Parent  or their respective
Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating existing relationships,  contractual rights or
obligations of the Company or Parent or their

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respective  Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any venture or other
arrangement;  (iv) creating any relationship, contractual rights or
obligations of the  Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or (v)
effectuating any  other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent or
their respective  Subsidiaries (and, in each case, shall enter into
agreements or stipulate to  the  entry of an order or decree or file
appropriate applications with any Antitrust  Authority in connection with any
of the foregoing and in the case of actions  by  or with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses  or  assets, by
consenting to such action by the Company and _provided_ that any  such action
may, at the discretion of the Parent, be conditioned upon  consummation of
the Merger) (each a " _Divestiture Action_ ") to ensure that  no Governmental
Entity enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling,  injunction
(preliminary or permanent), or establishes any law, rule, regulation  or
other action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or 
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (" _Antitrust Prohibition_ ")
and  to ensure that no Antitrust Authority with the authority to clear,
authorize  or  otherwise approve the consummation of the Merger, fails to do
so by the  Termination Date. In the event that any action is threatened or 
instituted challenging the Merger as violative of any Premerger Notification 
Rule or other Antitrust Law, Parent shall take all action necessary,
including  but not limited to any Divestiture Action, to avoid or resolve
such  action. In the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or 
other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in
any  proceeding that would make consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby  in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would
restrain,  enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall take
promptly any  and  all steps necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such
injunction or order so  as  to permit such consummation prior to the
Termination Date. The  parties shall take reasonable efforts to share
information protected from  disclosure under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine, joint  defense privilege or any other privilege
pursuant to this section so as to  preserve any applicable privilege.

 

 

(c) Parent  and Merger Sub and any of their respective Affiliates shall not
take any action  with the intention to, or that could reasonably be expected
to, hinder or delay  the obtaining of clearance or any necessary approval of
any Antitrust Authority  under an Premerger Notification Rule or Antitrust
Law or the expiration of  the  required waiting period under the Premerger
Notification Rules or any other  Antitrust Laws, except as may be necessary,
in its good faith judgment, to  resist or reduce the scope of a Divestiture
Action but in no event shall any  delay caused by any such action extend
beyond the Termination Date.

 

 

(d) If  any Divestiture Action agreed to by Parent requires action by or with
respect  to  the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or
assets, and such  action would constitute a breach of this Agreement, the
Parent hereby agrees  to  consent to the taking of such action by the
Company and any such action may,  at  the discretion of the Company, be
conditioned upon consummation of the  Merger.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding  anything else contained herein, the provisions of this
_Section 5.4_ shall  not be construed to require either party to undertake
any efforts, or to take  or  consent to any action, if such efforts, action
or consent would be reasonably  likely to result in a material adverse effect
on the business, operations,  financial condition or results of operations of
the combined business of Parent  and the Company after giving effect to the
consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby.

5.5 _Employee  Matters_

 

 

(a) Parent  or the Surviving Corporation shall take such action as may be
necessary so  that  on and after the Effective Time through the period
ending December 31, 2008,  employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
other than current elected  executive officers of the Company (approximately
20 individuals), who are not  covered by any collective bargaining agreement
or labor contract who remain  employed after the Closing by Parent, its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates or the  Surviving Corporation (the " _Parent Group_
"), are provided compensation  opportunities (including, but not limited to,
base salary, base wages, annual  and long-term incentive compensation and
phantom stock and phantom option  awards) and benefits opportunities
(including, but not limited to, pension  and  welfare benefits and vacation
pay but excluding equity compensation) which  are,  in the aggregate,
materially no less favorable than the compensation and  benefits (including
the target value of phantom options, phantom restricted  stock and
performance units) made available by the Company and its Subsidiaries  to its
employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the  extent not
duplicative of benefits, for purposes of eligibility to participate, 
calculation of benefits and vesting in all benefits provided by the Parent 
Group  to officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, such
officers  and  employees will be credited with their years of benefits
eligibility service  with  the Company and its Subsidiaries and any
predecessors thereof to the extent  such  service with a predecessor was so
recognized under analogous Employee Benefit  Plans (including, but not
limited to vacation pay plans) of the Company and  its  Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time. The eligibility of any such  officer or employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to participate in any  welfare benefit plan
or program of the Parent Group shall not be subject to  any  exclusions for
any pre-existing conditions if such individual had met the  participation
requirements of similar benefit plans and programs of the Company  and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Amounts paid before  the Effective
Time by such officers and employees of the Company and its  Subsidiaries
under any health plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall,  after the
Effective Time, be taken into account in applying deductible and  out-of-
pocket limits applicable under the health plans of the Parent Group  to  the
same extent as if such amounts had, when paid, been paid under such health 
plans of the Parent Group. Nothing contained in this _Section  5.5_ shall
create any rights in any officer or employee of the Company or any  of its
Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment for any specified period  of
any nature or kind whatsoever or, except as set forth in this Agreement, 
limit Parent\'s or the Surviving Corporation\'s power to amend or terminate
any  particular Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan or require (and
the  Company shall take no action that would require) the Parent or
Surviving  Corporation to continue any particular Employee Benefit Plan or
Foreign Benefit  Plan. To the extent that an agreement with a labor union,
works council or  a  similar entity obligates the Company to require a
purchaser or merger partner  to  assume the terms of that agreement, Parent
agrees to cause the Surviving  Corporation to recognize the entity that is a
party to such an agreement as  the  exclusive bargaining representative of
the covered employees and to cause the  Surviving Corporation to adopt the
terms of that agreement and any related  and  current memorandums of
agreement between the Company and such  entity.

 

 

(b) Except  as necessary to comply with applicable law, for a period ending
on the later  of  (i) twelve months from the Effective Time or (ii) December
31, 2008, Parent  Group shall not terminate or otherwise amend the severance
plans described  in  _Schedule 5.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter in a
manner adverse to  any officer or employee of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Company  or any of its Subsidiaries covered by such plans immediately prior
to the  Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent Group shall 
not, with respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
remain  Employed after the signing by the Parent Group, terminate or permit
the  Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to terminate or otherwise
amend any  severance plan at a time, or in a manner, not permitted under the
terms of  that  plan.

 

 

(c) Parent  or the Surviving Corporation shall take such action as may be
necessary so  that  on or immediately after the Effective Time, the benefits
payable under the  Lyondell Chemical Company Supplementary Executive
Retirement Plan, the Lyondell  Chemical Company Executive Deferral Plan, the
Lyondell Chemical Company Director  Deferral Plan and the Lyondell Chemical
Company Retirement Plan for Non-Employee  Directors are paid in accordance
with plan terms. Parent or the Surviving  Corporation shall take such action
as may be necessary so that the benefits  payable in cash under outstanding
performance unit awards, phantom option awards  and phantom restricted stock
awards under the terms of (i) the Lyondell Chemical  Company Non-Executive
Incentive Plan will be paid in full on or immediately  after the Effective
Time in accordance with their terms, and (ii) the Millennium  Chemicals Inc.
Non-Executive Incentive Plan, the Equistar Chemicals L.P. 2001  Incentive
Plan, the Equistar Chemicals, L.P. Non-Executive Incentive Plan and  the
Houston Refining L.P. Non-Executive Incentive Plan (the "Subsidiary 
Incentive Plans") will be paid in full on the later of January 15, 2008 or 
thirty days after the Effective Time, in each case with such payments under 
the  Lyondell Chemical Company Non-Executive Incentive Plan and the
Subsidiary  Incentive Plans to be based on the methodology described in
_Sections 2.3_ ,  _2.4_ and _2.5_ and it is expressly understood and agreed
that the  Subsidiary Incentive Plans will be amended prior to the Effective
Time to  reflect these obligations and as necessary to comply with section
409A of the  Code; provided that, such amendments do not cause a material
increase in the  cost to the Company of providing benefits under such plans.
Parent or the  Surviving Corporation shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to pay annual  incentive bonuses for the 2007 calendar year, in
accordance with the terms  of  the bonus plans or programs presently in
effect, based on the actual achievement  of the approved performance criteria
for 2007, provided all such annual  incentive bonuses for the 2007 calendar
year have not been made by the Company  prior to the Closing. In furtherance
of the provisions set forth in  _Section 5.5(a)_ above, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the  Company and its Subsidiaries to
administer the annual cash bonus awards under  the existing administrative
guidelines for annual cash bonus awards in all  material respects so that
annual cash bonuses payable in 2008 with respect  to  the 2007 performance
year shall be determined on the basis of financial  performance achieved by
the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall not be  affected in any way by any
expenses or balance sheet changes on or after the  Effective Time resulting
from or related to the Merger.

 

 

5.6 _Indemnification;  Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance_

 

 

(a) Without  limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person (as
defined below) may  have pursuant to any employment agreement or
indemnification agreement in effect  on the date hereof, from and after the
Effective Time through the six year  anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify,  defend and hold harmless (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation  to  indemnify, defend and hold
harmless) each Person who is now, or has been at  any  time prior to the
date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective  Time, a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or  who

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acts  as a  fiduciary under any Employee Benefit Plan of the Company or any
of its  Subsidiaries in their capacity as such and not as stockholder or
optionholder  of  the Company or its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified
Persons_ ") against all  losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties,
expenses (including attorneys\'  and other professionals\' fees and
expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts  that are paid in settlement
(with the approval of the indemnifying party),  of or  incurred in
connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,  proceeding or
investigation to which such Indemnified Person is a party based,  in whole or
in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that  such
Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Employee Benefit Plan of the Company or 
any  of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company
or any  of  its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another  corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
employee  benefit plan, trust or other enterprise or by reason of anything
done or not  done by such Person in any such capacity, pertaining to any act
or omission  occurring or existing prior to, the Effective Time and whether
asserted or  claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time ("
_Indemnified  Liabilities_ "), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in
whole or in  part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining
to, this Agreement  or the Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent
permitted under  applicable law (and the Surviving Corporation shall pay
reasonable expenses  incurred in defense of any claim in connection therewith
in advance of the  final  disposition of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation to  each  Indemnified Person to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law;  _provided_ that any person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an  undertaking to repay such advances if it
is ultimately determined that such  person is not entitled to
indemnification). Without limiting the  foregoing, in the event any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or  investigation is brought against any
Indemnified Persons (whether asserted  before or after the Effective Time),
(i) the Indemnified Persons may retain  the  Company\'s regularly engaged
legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to  them,  and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and  expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Persons as promptly as statements  therefor are
received, and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall  cooperate in
the defense of any such matter, _provided_ that neither Parent  nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected  without
its prior written consent. Any Indemnified Person wishing to  claim
indemnification under this _Section 5.6_ , upon learning of any such  claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify the Surviving 
Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any 
obligations that it may have under this _Section 5.6_ except to the extent 
such failure materially prejudices such party\'s position with respect to
such  claims) and, if required by law, shall deliver to the Surviving
Corporation  an  undertaking to repay any amounts advanced to it if it shall
ultimately be  determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to
indemnification,  but  without any requirement for the posting of a bond or
any other terms or  conditions other than those expressly set forth herein; 
_provided_ _further_ , that Parent shall not be obligated pursuant to  this
_Section 5.6(a)_ to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one  counsel
for all Indemnified Persons in any single action, unless, in the good  faith
judgment of any of the Indemnified Persons, there is or may be a conflict  of
interests between two or more of such Indemnified Persons, in which case 
there may be separate counsel for each similarly situated group.

 

 

(b) Parent  and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify the  Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation in any  manner that would adversely affect (or manage the
Surviving Corporation or  its  Subsidiaries,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  intent to adversely affect) the rights thereunder or under the
Company  Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws of any Indemnified
Person to  indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent
required  by  law. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to,  fulfill and honor any indemnification or exculpation agreements between
the  Company and any of its directors, officers or employees existing
immediately  prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

(c) Parent  and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnified
Person against  all  reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees and  expenses), relating to the enforcement of such
Indemnified Person\'s rights  under  this _Section 5.6_ or under any
charter, bylaw or contract, provided that  such Indemnified Party is
successful in enforcing such claim.

 

 

(d) Parent  agrees that immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will cause  to  be put in place, and Parent shall fully prepay immediately
prior to the  Effective Time, "tail" insurance policies with a claims period
of at least  six  years from the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better  credit rating as the Company\'s current insurance
carrier with respect to  directors\' and officers\' liability insurance in an
amount and scope at least  as  favorable as the Company\'s existing policies
with respect to matters, acts  or  omissions existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ , that in no event shall Parent be
required to spend more than  200% (the " _Cap Amount_ ") of the last annual
premium paid by the  Company prior to the date hereof (the amount of such
premium being set forth  in  _Schedule 3.1(q)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter) per policy year of  coverage under such tail policy; _provided_ ,
_further_ that if the  cost per policy year of such insurance exceeds the Cap
Amount, Parent shall  purchase as much coverage per policy year as reasonably
obtainable for the  Cap  Amount.

 

 

(e) In  the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors  or  assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not  be  the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or  merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all
of its properties and assets  to any other Person, then, in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made  so  that such other Person shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section  5.6(e)_ in addition to the Surviving
Corporation remaining liable for such  obligations. The provisions of this
_Section 5.6(e)_ are  intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the parties  hereto and each Person entitled to
indemnification or insurance coverage or  expense advancement pursuant to
this _Section 5.6(e)_ , and his heirs and  representatives.

 

 

(f) Parent  will ensure (including providing funding, if necessary) that the
obligations  of  the Surviving Corporation in this _Section 5.6_ are
fulfilled.

 

 

5.7 _Agreement  to Defend_. In  the event any claim, action, suit,
investigation or other legal or  administrative proceeding by any
Governmental Entity or other Person is  commenced that questions the validity
or legality of the Transactions or seeks  damages in connection therewith,
the parties hereto agree to cooperate and  use  their reasonable best
efforts to defend against and respond  thereto. The Company shall give
Parent  reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement
of  any stockholder litigation against the Company and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  directors relating to any Transaction, _provided_ , that no such
settlement  shall be agreed to without Parent\'s consent, which shall not be
unreasonably  withheld, conditioned or delayed.


 

5.8 _Public  Announcements_. The  parties hereto will consult with each
other before issuing, and will provide  each other reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon, any press release  or otherwise making any written
public statements with respect to this  Agreement, the Merger or the other
Transactions, and shall not issue any such  press release or make any such
written public statement prior to such  consultation, except as Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company may be required by  applicable law, court order or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement  with any national
securities exchange (in which case such party will, to the  extent
practicable, promptly inform the other parties hereto in writing in  advance
of such compelled disclosure).

 

 

5.9 _Advice  of Certain Matters; Control of Business_. Subject  to
compliance with all applicable laws, the Company and Parent, as the case 
may  be, shall confer on a regular basis with each other, report on
operational  matters and shall promptly advise each other orally and in
writing of any change  or event having, or which would be reasonably likely
to have, individually  or in  the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect or Parent Material Adverse  Effect, as the case may be. The Company
and Parent shall promptly  provide each other (or their respective counsel)
copies of all filings made  by  such party or its Subsidiaries with the SEC
or any other Governmental Entity  in  connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions. Prior to the  Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,

and supervision of the Company\'s  operations.

which become payable in connection with the Transactions,  (b) cooperate in
the preparation, execution and filing of all applications  or  other
documents regarding any applicable exemptions to any such Tax or fee,  and 
(c) each pay any such Tax or fee which becomes payable by it on or before
the  due date therefor.

 

 

5.11 _Investigation  by Parent and Merger Sub; No Other Representations or 
Warranties_

 

 

(a) Each  of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has made
its own  inquiry and investigation into, and, based on the information
provided by the  Company, has formed an independent judgment concerning, the
Company and its  Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations, and Parent
and Merger Sub  have  requested such documents and information from the
Company as each such party  considers material in determining whether to
enter into this Agreement and  to  consummate the transactions contemplated
in this Agreement. Each of  Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees
that it has had an opportunity  to  ask all questions of and receive answers
from the Company with respect to any  matter such party considers material in
determining whether to enter into this  Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated in this  Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Each  of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, except for the
representations and  warranties made by the Company that are expressly set
forth in _Section  3.1_ of this Agreement (as modified by the Company
Disclosure Letter or as  disclosed in the Company SEC Documents) and in any
certificate provided pursuant  to _Section 6.2(c)_ , neither the Company nor
any other Person has made or  shall be deemed to have made any representation
or warranty of any  kind. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of  Parent and Merger Sub agrees that neither the Company, any holder of
the  Company\'s securities nor any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives,  makes or has made any representation or warranty to Parent,
Merger Sub or any  of  their representatives or Affiliates with respect to:

 

 

(i) any  projections, forecasts or other estimates, plans or budgets of
future revenues,  expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or
any component  thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or
future financial  condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any
of its  Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the
Company or  any  of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or
made available  to  Parent, Merger Sub or their respective representatives
or Affiliates;  or

 

 

(ii) any  other information, statement or documents heretofore or hereafter
delivered  to  or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
representatives  or  Affiliates, except to the extent and as expressly
covered by a representation  and warranty made by the Company and contained
in _Section 3.1_ of this  Agreement.

 

 

5.12 _Financing_

 

 

(a) Parent  shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions  and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to  arrange and consummate the financing necessary to
consummate the Transactions  (the " _Debt Financing_ ") on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt  Commitment Letter, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy  on a timely basis all terms,
covenants and conditions set forth in the Debt  Commitment Letter; (ii) enter
into definitive agreements with respect  thereto on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter;  (iii) enforce its rights under
the Debt Commitment Letter; and  (iv) consummate the Debt Financing at or
prior to the Effective  Time. Parent will furnish correct and complete copies
of all such  definitive agreements to the Company promptly upon their
execution.

 

 

(b) Parent  shall keep the Company informed with respect to all material
activity concerning  the status of the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter  and  shall give the Company prompt notice of any
material adverse change with respect  to such Debt Financing. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees  to notify the Company promptly, and in
any event within two Business Days,  if at  any time (i) any Debt Commitment
Letter shall expire or be terminated for  any reason, (ii) any financing
source that is a party to any Debt  Commitment Letter notifies Parent that
such source no longer intends to provide  financing to Parent on the terms
set forth therein, or (iii) for any reason  Parent no longer believes in good
faith that it will be able to obtain all  or  any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on  the  terms described therein.
Parent shall not,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  shall  not permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior written
consent of the  Company, take or fail to take any action or enter into any
transaction,  including any merger, acquisition, joint venture, disposition,
lease, contract  or debt or equity financing, that could reasonably be
expected to breach or  make  untrue any representation or warranty contained
in the Commitment Letters or  otherwise impair, delay or prevent consummation
of the Financing contemplated  by  any of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent
shall not amend or alter,  or agree to amend or alter, any Debt Commitment
Letter in any manner that would  prevent or materially impair or delay the
consummation of Transactions without  the prior written consent of the
Company.

 

 

(c) If  any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and  conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt
Commitment  Letter shall be terminated or modified in a manner materially
adverse to Parent  for any reason, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange to  obtain alternative financing from alternative sources
in an amount sufficient  to  consummate the Transactions (" _Alternate
Financing_ ") and to obtain, and,  if obtained, will provide the Company with
a copy of, a new financing commitment  that provides for at least the same
amount of financing as such Debt Commitment  Letter as originally issued and
on terms and conditions (including termination  rights and funding
conditions) no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent  or  Merger Sub
than those included in such Debt Commitment Letter (the " _New  Commitment
Letter_ "). To the extent applicable, Parent shall use  its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all things necessary,  proper or
advisable to arrange promptly and consummate the Alternate Financing  on the
terms and conditions described in any New Commitment Letter, including  using
reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy on a timely basis all terms, 
covenants and conditions set forth in the New Commitment Letter; (ii) enter 
into  definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions  contemplated by the New Commitment Letter; (iii) enforce its
rights under the  New Commitment Letter; and (iv) consummate the Alternate
Financing at or prior  to the Closing.

(a) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement or  otherwise, in the event that Parent determines,
in its reasonable, good faith  judgment that doing so will increase the
likelihood of the consummation of  the  transactions contemplated hereby,
Parent shall have the right to commence,  or to  cause Merger Sub or another
one of its affiliates (such entity, the " _Tender  Offeror_ ") to commence,
at any time after the date hereof, a cash tender  offer for any and all of
the issued and outstanding shares of the Company Common  Stock at a purchase
price per share, net to the holders thereof, equal  to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Merger Consideration, provided, that (i) it shall be a condition to
the  obligation of the Tender Offeror to accept for payment and pay for
shares of  Company Common Stock tendered in the tender offer that there shall
have been  validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration date of
the tender  offer that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, when
added to any  shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and Merger Sub,
represents 90%  or  greater of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (such  condition, the " _Minimum Condition_ "), (ii) except for
the Minimum  Condition, the obligation of the Tender Offeror to accept for
payment and pay  for shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the tender
offer shall not be  more conditional than the obligation of Parent and Merger
Sub to consummate  the  Merger, (iii) Parent, Merger Sub and/or the Tender
Offeror shall be obligated  to  consummate (x) the Merger or (y) a merger
providing for cash consideration  at  least equal to the Merger
Consideration and which shall otherwise be on terms  and conditions no less
favorable to the holders of shares of Company Common  Stock than the Merger,
(iv) the tender offer shall comply with all applicable  laws, including the
Exchange Act, Sections 14(d) and 14(e) thereof and the  rules, regulations
and schedules promulgated thereunder, and (v) the Tender  Offeror shall not
be required to accept for payment or pay for any validly  tendered shares if,
at the expiration date of the tender offer the conditions  set forth in
_Section 6.1_ (other than _Section 6.1(a)_ ) and  _Section 6.2_ of this
Agreement shall not have been satisfied or  waived.  The expiration date of
the tender offer shall not be earlier than 60 calendar  days after the date
hereof; provided, however, that if a Third Party commences  a  tender offer
for 50% of more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,  the
tender offer by the Tender Offeror may expire one (1) Business Day prior 
to  the initial expiration date of such other tender offer. The parties 
hereto shall (a) negotiate in good faith and as expeditiously as practicable 
any  and all amendments, modifications or waivers of this Agreement and the 
Confidentiality Agreement necessary or appropriate to implement this
_Section  5.16_ , (b) make any and all amendments or modifications to the
Proxy  Statement, (c) make any and all filings with or submissions to (and/or
make  any  and all amendments or modifications to existing filings or
submissions), and  seek any and all consents, authorizations and permits
from, any Governmental  Entity necessary or appropriate in light of the
tender offer, including under  any Antitrust Law, other applicable law or
otherwise, and (d) otherwise take  any  and all actions necessary or
appropriate to implement this _Section 5.16_   and to ensure the Merger and
the tender offer comply with all applicable laws  and are consummated. For
avoidance of doubt, the Company acknowledges that  the  representations and
warranties set forth in _Sections 3.1(v)_ and  _3.1(y)_ apply to the tender
offer described in this _Section  5.16_. In the event that the Tender Offeror
shall acquire in the  aggregate a number of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, pursuant  to the tender offer or otherwise, sufficient to
enable Parent, Merger Sub or  the  Company to cause the Merger to become
effective pursuant to Section 253 of  the  DGCL without a meeting of
stockholders of the Company, Parent shall take all  necessary and appropriate
action to cause the Merger to become effective  pursuant to Section 253 of
the DGCL as soon as practicable after such  acquisition, without a meeting of
stockholders of the Company, in accordance  with and subject to the DGCL. For
avoidance of doubt, in such event  consummation of the Merger shall not be
subject to any of the conditions set  forth in _Article VI_ hereof. Parent
shall amend or alter the  Debt Commitment Letter or enter into new debt
commitment letter(s) that would  enable the Tender Offeror to finance the
tender offer and the Merger in order  to  effect the tender offer in
accordance with the provisions in this _Section  5.16_ ; provided that any
such financing shall be on terms no less favorable  in the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggregate  to Parent or Merger Sub than those included in such Debt
Commitment Letter  and  reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  Section 1.5 hereof or any other provision hereof, upon
the completion of the  tender offer and until the Effective Time (the "
_Interim Period_ "), the  Board of Directors of the Company shall have at
least three directors who are  directors of the Company on the date of this
Agreement (the " _Continuing  Directors_ "); and provided further that, in
such event, if the number of  Continuing Directors shall be reduced below
three for any reason whatsoever,  the  remaining Continuing Directors or
Director shall designate a person or persons  to fill any such vacancy who
shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director. During  the Interim Period, the
approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors  then  serving shall be
required to (i) authorize any agreement between the Company  and  any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub or any of  their 
Affiliates on the other hand, (ii) amend or terminate this Agreement on
behalf  of the Company, (iii) exercise or waive any of the Company's rights
or remedies  hereunder, (iv) waive or extend the time for performance of
Parent's or Merger  Sub's obligations hereunder, (v) amend the Company's or
any of its Subsidiaries' charter or bylaws, if such action would adversely
affect the holders of shares  of Company Common Stock, or (vi) take any other
action by the Company in  connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby required  to be taken by the Company's Board of
Directors.

Effective Time, (i) Parent will continue  to  engage in business in same
general type as now conducted by Parent, (ii) Parent  will not consolidate or
merge with or into any other Person, and (iii) Parent  will not sell or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets  to  any other

counsel  of  its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the 
execution

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  this  Agreement and that it has executed the same with the advice of
said independent  counsel. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the
drafting and  preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to
herein, and any  and  all drafts relating thereto exchanged between the
parties shall be deemed the  work product of the parties and may not be
construed against any party by reason  of its preparation. Accordingly, any
rule of law or any legal  decision that would require interpretation of any
ambiguities in this Agreement  against any party that drafted it is of no
application and is hereby expressly  waived.

 

 

(b) The  inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent  Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
in and  of  itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information
in the Company  Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable,
that such  information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure
Letter or Parent  Disclosure Letter, as applicable, or that such information
is material to the  Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, Parent or
Merger Sub,  as the case may be. The headings, if any, of the individual
sections  of each of the Parent Disclosure Letter and Company Disclosure
Letter are  inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to
constitute a part  thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company
Disclosure Letter  and Parent Disclosure Letter are arranged in sections
corresponding to those  contained in _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2_ merely
for convenience,  and the disclosure of (i) an item in one section of the
Company Disclosure  Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter as an exception to a
particular  representation or warranty and (ii) disclosures made in the
Company SEC  Documents shall in each case be deemed adequately disclosed as
an exception  with  respect to all other representations or warranties to
the extent that the  relevance of such item to such other representations or
warranties is reasonably  apparent on its face from such item,
notwithstanding the presence or absence  of  an appropriate section of the
Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure  Letter with respect to such
other representations or warranties or an  appropriate cross reference
thereto.

 

 

(c) The  specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or  otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure
Letter or Parent  Disclosure Letter is not intended and shall not be deemed
to be an admission  or  acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or
items, nor shall the same  be used in any dispute or controversy between the
parties to determine whether  any obligation, item or matter (whether or not
described herein or included  in  any schedule) is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement.

 

 

(d) All  references in this Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, Articles,
Sections,  subsections and other subdivisions refer to the corresponding
Exhibits,  Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions
of this  Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles appearing at 
the beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions 
of  this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute any part of
such  Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions, and shall be
disregarded  in construing the language contained therein. The words "this 
Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof" and words of
similar  import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision  unless expressly so limited. The words "this Section," "this 
subsection" and words of similar import, refer only to the Sections or 
subsections hereof in which such words occur. The word "including"  (in its
various forms) means "including, without limitation."

terms defined herein)  in  the singular form shall be construed to include
the plural and vice versa,  unless the context otherwise expressly requires.
Unless the context  otherwise requires, all defined terms contained herein
shall include the  singular and plural and the conjunctive and disjunctive
forms of such defined  terms. Unless the context otherwise requires, all
references to a  specific time shall refer to Houston, Texas time.


 

8.5 _Counterparts_. This  Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, including via facsimile  transmission, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and  shall become effective when two or
more counterparts have been signed by each  of  the parties and delivered to
the other parties, it being understood that all  parties need not sign the
same counterpart.

 

 

8.6 _Entire  Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This  Agreement
(together with the Confidentiality Agreement and any other documents  and
instruments executed pursuant hereto) constitutes the entire agreement  and 
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, 
among  the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except for
the  (i) rights of holders of Company Common Stock to enforce their rights to
receive  Merger Consideration in accordance with ARTICLE II upon consummation
of the  Merger in the event the Merger is consummated, and (ii) Indemnified
Persons,  who  are intended to be third party beneficiaries of _Section
5.6,_ and who  shall have the right to enforce such provisions directly,

remedy of any nature  whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

take any action inconsistent herewith or not to take an  action consistent
herewith or required hereby, the validity, legality and  enforceability of
the remaining provisions and obligations contained or set  forth herein shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, unless the  foregoing
