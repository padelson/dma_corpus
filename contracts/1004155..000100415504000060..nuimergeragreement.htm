of Merger_ ") shall be duly prepared, executed and acknowledged by Sub and the
Company in accordance with the NJBCA and shall be filed with the Division of
Revenue of the Department of Treasury of the State of New Jersey in accordance

Certificate of Merger as shall be agreed to by Parent and the Company). The
date and time when the Merger shall become effective is hereinafter referred
to as the " _Effective Time_."

 

(a)

 

On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the NJBCA, at the Effective Time, Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease, and
the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation under the laws of the
State of New Jersey (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

(b)

 

From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth
in N.J.S.A. 14A:10-6 of the NJBCA. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties,
rights, privileges and powers of the Company and Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Sub shall become debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

Section 2.2. _Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_.
The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.3. _By-laws of the Surviving Corporation_. The Amended and
Restated By-laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.4. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each of such directors to
hold office, subject to the applicable provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until their respective
successors shall be duly elected or appointed and qualified. At the Effective
Time, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time,
together with such other persons as Parent shall designate, shall, subject to
the applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of
the Surviving Corporation, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors shall be duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 

Section 2.5. _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time:

 

(a)

 

Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any Shares which are held by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company or in the treasury of the Company, or which are held, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent (including Sub), all of
which shall cease to be outstanding and be canceled and none of which shall
receive any payment with respect thereto) and all rights in respect of such
Shares shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, forthwith cease to exist and be converted into and
represent the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the Merger Price; and

 

(b)

 

Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Sub, then issued and
outstanding, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.6. _Paying Agent; Surrender of Certificates_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company located in the
United States to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive funds
in trust in order to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.5(a). Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a paying agent agreement with
the Paying Agent in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company.
As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail and/or make available to each holder of a certificate which,
prior to the Effective Time, represented Shares or any portion of a Share
(other than those which are held by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company
or in the treasury of the Company, or which are held directly or indirectly by
Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent (including Sub)) a
notice and letter of transmittal advising such holder of the effectiveness of
the Merger and the procedure for surrendering to the Paying Agent such
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares or any portion of a Share (the " _Certificates_
") in exchange for the aggregate Merger Price deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Article II. Upon the surrender for cancellation to the
Paying Agent of such Certificates, together with a letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereon, and any
other items specified by the letter of transmittal, the Paying Agent shall
promptly pay to the Person entitled thereto the product of the Merger Price
and the number of Shares and any portion of a Share represented by such
Certificates. Until so surrendered, each Certificate shall be deemed, for all
corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to receive upon such surrender
the aggregate Merger Price deliverable in respect thereof to which such Person
is entitled pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall be paid or accrued
in respect of such cash payments.

 

(a)

 

If the aggregate Merger Price (or any portion thereof) is to be delivered to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificates surrendered in
exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a condition to the payment of
such Merger Price that the Certificates so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such transfer pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or
establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes have been
paid or are not required to be paid.

 

(b)

 

If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the aggregate Merger Price
deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this Article
II.

 

Section 2.7. _Payment_. Concurrently with or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited in trust with
the Paying Agent cash in United States dollars in an aggregate amount equal to
the product of (a) the number of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Shares which are held by any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company or in the treasury of the Company, or which are held
directly or indirectly by Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of
Parent (including Sub)) and (b) the Merger Price (such amount being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Sub (i) in direct obligations of
the United States, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the
United States is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest,
commercial paper of an issuer organized under the laws of a state of the
United States rated of the highest quality by Moodys Investors Service, Inc.
or Standard and Poors Ratings Group, or certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of a United States commercial
bank having at least $1,000,000,000 in assets (collectively, " _Permitted
Investments_ ") or (ii) in money market funds which are invested in Permitted
Investments, and any net earnings with respect thereto shall be paid to Sub as
and when requested by Sub. The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, make the payments referred to in Section 2.5(a) out of the
Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
Promptly following the date which is one (1) year after the Effective Time,
the Paying Agent shall return to the Surviving Corporation all cash,
certificates and other instruments in its possession that constitute any
portion of the Payment Fund, and the Paying Agents duties shall terminate.
Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate may surrender such Certificate to the
Surviving Corporation and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat
and similar laws) receive in exchange therefor the aggregate Merger Price
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Article II, without interest,
but shall have no greater rights against the Surviving Corporation than may be
accorded to general creditors of the Surviving Corporation under Applicable
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any Party
shall be liable to a holder of Shares for any Merger Price with respect to
such Shares delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat and similar laws.

 

Section 2.8. _No Further Rights of Transfers_. At and after the Effective
Time, each holder of Shares shall cease to have any rights as a shareholder of
the Company, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law and except for, in
the case of a holder of a Certificate (other than Shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section 2.5(a)), the right to surrender his or her Certificate in
exchange for payment of the applicable aggregate Merger Price, and no transfer
of Shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation. Certificates presented to the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time shall be canceled and exchanged for cash as provided in this
Article II. At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time the
stock ledger of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed.

 

Section 2.9. _Stock Options and Restricted Stock_. Prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding stock option and other right to purchase or otherwise
acquire Shares (each, an " _Option_ " and, collectively, the " _Options_ ")
heretofore granted under any stock option or stock-based compensation plan of
the Company or otherwise (the " _Stock Plans_ "), whether or not then vested
or exercisable shall become 100% vested and exercisable and shall no longer be
exercisable for the purchase of Shares but shall entitle each holder thereof,
in cancellation and settlement therefor, to payments in cash (the " _Cash
Payment_ "), at the Effective Time, equal to the product of (i) the total
number of Shares subject to such Option, whether or not then vested or
exercisable and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Merger Price exceeds the
exercise price per Share subject to such Option; each such Cash Payment to be
paid to each holder of an outstanding Option at the Effective Time. Section
2.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each Stock Plan and the outstanding
Options. The Company shall terminate, as of the Effective Time, the Stock
Plans and amend, as of the Effective Time, the provisions of any other
Employee Benefit Plans providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any
capital stock of the Company, or any interest in respect of any capital stock
of the Company, to provide no continuing rights to acquire, hold, transfer or
grant any capital stock of the Company or any interest in the capital stock of
the Company. Upon the execution by Parent and Sub of this Agreement, the
Company shall suspend the NUI Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("
_ESPP_ ") and the NUI Corporation 1996 Director Stock Purchase Plan (" _DSPP_
") so that, as of the Effective Time, no options shall be outstanding under
either such plan. The Company shall (i) cause each such suspension to
continue until the earlier of (A) the Effective Time and (B) the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII hereof, and (ii) terminate the ESPP
and the DSPP effective as of the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding participant account balance under the NUI Corporation Deferred
Compensation Plan that is denominated in Shares shall be converted into a
right to receive an amount, in cash, at the Effective Time, equal to the
Merger Price multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such account. At
the Effective Time, each outstanding deferred restricted stock credit under
the NUI Corporation 1996 Stock Option, Stock Award and Incentive Plan shall be
converted into a right to receive an amount, in cash, at the Effective Time,
equal to the Merger Price multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such
deferred restricted stock credit.

 

(a)

 

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Share in the form of restricted
stock outstanding under the Stock Plans shall become, subject to applicable
securities laws, fully and immediately transferable and the restrictions
thereon shall lapse.

 

Section 2.10. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company and Parent shall take all such steps as may be required and permitted
to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
dispositions of equity securities (including derivative securities) of the
Company by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company,
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 2.11. _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned pursuant to
Article VII, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in Article VI, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_

that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions, or at such other date, time or
place as the Parties shall agree in writing. Such date is herein referred to
as the " _Closing Date_ ".

 

Section 2.12. _Withholding Rights; Transfer Taxes_. The Company or the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to and will deduct and withhold, or
cause to be deducted or withheld, from any payment made pursuant to this
Article II, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
applicable state, local or foreign Tax law. Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and take
all reasonable and necessary steps between the date hereof and the Effective
Time to determine if any amounts should be withheld or deducted pursuant to
Section 1445 of the Code from any payments made pursuant to this Article II
and the Company agrees that it will withhold or deduct any such amounts as may
be required under Applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holders in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

(a)

 

From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent
shall reasonably cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax
Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any
Transfer Taxes and take all reasonable steps necessary to obtain any
exemptions from such Transfer Taxes.

  _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Section 3. The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Sub,
except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to
Parent and Sub upon or prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ "); _provided_ , _that_ , any such exception shall be
contained in the section of the Company Disclosure Letter corresponding to the
representation or warranty to which such exception is being taken, _provided_
, _further_ , that any such exception shall not be required to be contained in
other sections of the Company Disclosure Letter if the magnitude and
significance of the item excepted and its relationship to a particular
representation or warranty shall be reasonably discernable to Parent:

 

Section 3.1. _Due Organization, Good Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated (or, if
not a corporation, duly organized), validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation (or, if not a
corporation, organization) and each such Person has all requisite power
(corporate or otherwise) and authority, and has been duly authorized by all
necessary approvals and orders, to own, lease and operate its assets and
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased
or operated by it, or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, when taken together
with all other such failures, reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of the Companys Certificate
of Incorporation and the Companys By-laws and the comparable governing
documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case, as amended and in full
force and effect as of the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 3.2. _Authorization; Noncontravention_. The Company has the
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
to perform its obligations hereunder and (subject to the approval of the
shareholders of the Company as required by the NJBCA) to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Company, and the consummation by it of the transactions
contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized and approved by the Board, and
no other corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (other than, in each
case, as required by the NJBCA, the adoption of this Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company and the filing of appropriate merger documents
with the Division of Revenue of the Department of Treasury of the State of New
Jersey). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming that this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of Parent and Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the
extent that its enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and by general equitable
principles. The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, (a)
conflict with any of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-
laws or other equivalent charter documents, as applicable, of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, as amended to the date of this
Agreement, (b) conflict with or result in a breach of, or default under, any
Material Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or by which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
assets are bound or subject or (c) subject to the consents, approvals,
authorizations, declarations, filings and notices referred to in Section 3.4,
contravene any domestic or foreign law, rule or regulation or any order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award currently in effect,
which, in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.3. _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of (a) 30,000,000 Shares and (b) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
no par value per share, of which 100,000 shares of such preferred stock are
designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. At the close of
business on July 12, 2004 (the " _Capital Structure Date_ ") (i) 16,188,867
Shares were issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of preferred stock were
issued and outstanding, (iii) 218,706 Shares were held by the Company in its
treasury, (iv) 331,198 shares were subject to issuance upon exercise of
outstanding Options granted under the Stock Plans and Section 3.3(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the number of shares subject to issuance
pursuant to each Stock Plan, and (v) no shares of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock were subject to issuance pursuant to the
Companys Rights Agreement, dated as of March 2, 2001, by and between the
Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the "
_Rights Agreement_ "). Section 3.3(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth all of the subsidiaries of the Company and all partnerships, joint
ventures and similar entities of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a partner, member or participant as the case may be. All issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid
and nonassessable, and are not subject to any preemptive rights. Except as
set forth in this Section 3.3, at the close of business on the Capital
Structure Date, no shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the
Company or its Subsidiaries were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.
Since the close of business on the Capital Structure Date, no shares of
capital stock or other equity securities of the Company have been issued or
reserved for issuance or become outstanding, other than Shares described in
clause (iv) of the second sentence of this Section 3.3 that have been issued
upon the exercise of outstanding Options granted under the Stock Plans, as the
case may be. Except as described in this Section 3.3, there are no
outstanding options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, contracts or other rights
(including any preemptive right), agreements or commitments (whether written
or oral) which (x) obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
deliver, sell or transfer, or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, or
cause to be issued, delivered, sold or transferred, or repurchased, redeemed
or otherwise acquired, any shares of the capital stock of the Company or any
subsidiary, (y) restricts the transfer of any shares of capital stock of the
Company or (z) relates to the voting of any shares of capital stock of the
Company.

 

Section 3.4. _Consents and Approvals_. Assuming all filings required under
the Antitrust Laws are made and any waiting periods thereunder have been
terminated or expired, no Consent of or to any Governmental Entity or any
other third party, which has not been received or made, is necessary or
required with respect to the Company in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (a) the Consent
of each of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (the " _NJBPU_ "), the
Florida Public Service Commission (the " _FPSC_ "), the Maryland Public
Service Commission (the " _MPSC_ ") and the Virginia State Corporation
Commission (the " _VSCC_ "), (b) compliance with any applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act and any applicable state securities or blue sky laws, (c)
the filing of the Certificate of Merger, (d) the Consent of the Federal
Communications Commission, and (e) any other Consents which, if not made or
obtained, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.5. _Company Reports and Financial Statements_. Since September
30, 2003, the Company has filed all material forms, reports, schedules,
statements and other documents with the Commission relating to periods
commencing on or after such date required to be filed by it pursuant to the

consolidated financial position of the Company as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and changes in cash flows for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustment).

 

(b)

 

Except as reflected, reserved against or otherwise disclosed in the financial
statements of the Company included in the Exchange Act Reports filed and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of
the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations (absolute, accrued, fixed, contingent or otherwise)
required to be set forth in the Companys consolidated balance sheet under
GAAP, other than liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since
September 30, 2002 or which would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c)

 

Except as disclosed in the Exchange Act Reports, the Company has maintained
systems of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that (i) all transactions are executed in accordance with
managements general or specific authorization, and (ii) all transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of annual and interim
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain proper
accountability for items. Except as disclosed in the Exchange Act Reports,

managements report and the Companys independent auditors reports identify
no material weakness or control deficiency in accordance with or as defined by
PCAOB Standard No. 2 or Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

 

Section 3.6. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in

  _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB_

 

Section 4. Each of Parent and Sub hereby represents and warrants to the
Company as follows:

 

Section 4.1. _Due Organization, Good Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of
Parent and Sub is a corporation duly incorporated (or, if not a corporation,
duly organized), validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated (or, if not a corporation,
organization) and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on
its business as now being conducted. Each of Parent and Sub is duly qualified
or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Sub has
delivered to the Company complete and correct copies of its Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws, in each case, as amended and in full force and
effect as of the date of this Agreement. Neither Parent nor Sub is in
violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or By-
laws.

 

Section 4.2. _Authorization; Noncontravention_. Each of Parent and Sub has
the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by Parent and Sub and the consummation by each of them of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized and approved by the
Board of Directors of each of Parent and Sub and have been duly approved by
Parent as sole shareholder of Sub. No other corporate action on the part of
either of Parent or Sub is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by each of Parent and Sub and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (other than the filing of the
appropriate merger documents as required by the NJBCA). This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Sub and, assuming that
this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Sub,
enforceable against each of Parent and Sub in accordance with its terms,
except that such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally, and by general equitable
principles. The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, (a)
conflict with any of the provisions of the certificate or articles of
incorporation or by-laws (or comparable documents) of Parent or Sub, in each
case as amended to the date of this Agreement, (b) conflict with, result in a
breach of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
any material contract, agreement, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, lease or
other instrument to which Parent or Sub is a party or by which Parent or Sub
or any of their respective assets is bound or subject or (c) subject to the
consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, filings and notices
referred to in Section 4.3, contravene any domestic or foreign law, rule or
regulation or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or
award currently in effect, which, in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above,
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.3. _Consents and Approvals_. Except as set forth in Section 4.3
of the Parent Disclosure Letter, assuming all filings required under the
Antitrust Laws are made and any waiting periods thereunder have been
terminated or expired, no Consent of or to any Governmental Entity or any
other third party which has not been received or made, is necessary or
required with respect to Parent or Sub in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Sub or the consummation by Parent or
Sub, as the case may be, of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for (a) the Consent of each of the NJBPU, the FPSC, the MPSC
and the VSCC and the Consents set forth in Section 3.4(d), (b) compliance with
any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and any applicable state
securities or blue sky laws, (c) the filing of the Certificate of Merger and
(d) any other consents, approvals, authorizations, filings or notices which,
if not made or obtained, would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.4. _Information_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Sub in writing specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Proxy Statement or (ii) the
Other Filings will, at the respective times filed with the Commission and, in
addition, in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the date it or any amendment
or supplement thereto is mailed to shareholders, and at the time of the
Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they we made, not misleading. The Other Filings made by Parent or Sub will,
at the respective times filed with the Commission, comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, if applicable, except that no representation is made
by Parent or Sub with respect to statements made therein based on information
supplied by the Company in writing specifically for inclusion in the Other
Filings.

 

Section 4.5. _Broker s or Finders Fee_. Except for Morgan Stanley and Co.
Incorporated (whose fees and expenses as financial advisor to Parent and Sub
shall be paid by Parent or Sub), no agent, broker, Person or firm acting on
behalf of Parent or Sub is or shall be entitled to any fee, commission or
brokers or finders fees in connection with this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby from any of the parties hereto or from any
Affiliate of the Parties.

 

Section 4.6. _Sub s Operations_. Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has not
engaged in any business activities or conducted any operations other than in
connection with such transactions.

 

Section 4.7. _Funds_. Parent and Sub collectively have and, at the
Effective Time, Parent will cause Sub to have, cash on hand in an aggregate
amount sufficient to enable (a) Parent and Sub to timely perform their
obligations hereunder, including to pay in full (i) an amount equal to the
Payment Fund, (ii) the aggregate Cash Payment, and (iii) all fees and expenses
payable by Parent and Sub in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and, (b) the Company and its subsidiaries to
pay in full (i) any outstanding balance in respect of the $28 million and any
interest accrued thereon that the Company is required to return to its
ratepayers and the $2 million penalty and any interest accrued thereon, in
each case as required by the NJBPU Settlement Order upon a sale of the Company
and (ii) all Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries required
to be repaid as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

Section 4.8. _Litigation_. There is no action, suit, proceeding at law or
in equity, or any arbitration or any administrative or other proceeding by or
before any Governmental Entity pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened, against or affecting Parent or Sub, or any of their respective
properties or rights which would prohibit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 4.9. _Ownership of Shares_. Other than as contemplated by this
Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates or associates (as such
terms are defined under the Exchange Act) beneficially owns, directly or
indirectly, or is a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for
the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, any shares of
capital stock of the Company.

judgment of the Board (after consultation with its financial advisors), is or
may reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (y) the Board

duties to shareholders under Applicable Law, and (B) prior to furnishing such
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, the Company (x) provides prompt written notice to Parent to the effect

connection with, and any waivers of any breaches or violations of any
Contracts, permits, licenses or other agreements that may be caused by the
consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by
(i) promptly making all required filings or submissions to Governmental
Entities provided that the Company and Parent shall make all such filings and
submissions available to the other Party for review and comment prior to such
filing or submission, (ii) cooperating with one another in (A) determining
whether any other filings are required to be made with, or Consents are
required to be obtained from any Governmental Entity or any other third party
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (B) timely making all
such filings and timely seeking all such Consents and (iii) seeking to avoid
the entry of, or seeking to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or
judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including, by
defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any
Person. In addition, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Acceptable Orders from the NJBPU,
the FPSC, the MPSC and the VSCC approving the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. An " _Acceptable Order_ " shall mean a Final Order (or other
written communication reasonably satisfactory to Parent) that includes all of
the items set forth in Section 5.8 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, except to
the extent that the failure to include any such items or the inclusion of any
additional terms or conditions would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a Regulated Business Material Adverse Effect, in
each case after giving effect to the items set forth in Section 5.8 of the
Parent Disclosure Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that
in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Regulated
Business Material Adverse Effect has occurred for the purposes of this Section
5.8, the standard from which such determinations shall be made will be the
state of the Company or the Regulated Businesses, as the case may be, as it
would be if all of the items set forth in Section 5.8 of the Parent Disclosure
Letter were implemented and in effect. Any additional terms and conditions
contained in an Acceptable Order, other than the terms and conditions set
forth in Section 5.8 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, shall not necessarily
preclude such order from being an Acceptable Order but shall be considered in
the determination as to whether the condition set forth in Section 6.2(c) has
been satisfied.

 

(a)

 

The Company and Parent shall each promptly notify the other Party hereto and
shall promptly furnish copies of any notices or other communications relating
to: (a) any written notice from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; (b) any written notice from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (c) any claim
commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against, relating to, or involving
or otherwise affecting such Party that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to any provision
of this Agreement, or that relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (d) any of the following: (i) the
discovery by such Party that any representation or warranty of any Party
contained in this Agreement is untrue or inaccurate in any material respect,
or (ii) the occurrence or failure to occur of any event which occurrence or
failure to occur would reasonably be likely to cause any of the
representations or warranties in this Agreement to be untrue or incorrect in
any material respect as of the date made or as of the Closing Date, (iii) the
occurrence or failure to occur of any event which occurrence or failure to
occur would reasonably be likely to cause a Company Material Adverse Effect
and (iv) any material failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification, nor the
obligation to make such notification, shall affect the representations,
warranties or covenants of any Party or the conditions to the obligations of
any Party to this Agreement. To the extent such efforts do not unreasonably
interfere with the day-to-day operations of the Company, each of the Company
and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to consult with each other in advance
of any telephone calls, meetings or conferences with, any Governmental Entity
in connection with obtaining the Required Consents and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and, to the extent permitted and practicable,
give the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
telephone calls, meetings and conferences.

 

Section 5.9. _Employee Benefits_. For at least one (1) year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to all current
and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than any such

to the salary or wage level and bonus opportunity to which they were entitled
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) benefits, perquisites and
other terms and conditions of employment that, taken as a whole, are
substantially equivalent to the benefits, perquisites and other terms and
conditions that they were entitled to receive immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including benefits pursuant to qualified and non-qualified
retirement and savings plans, medical, dental and pharmaceutical plans and
programs, severance plans and policies, deferred compensation arrangements and
equity-based and incentive compensation plans). Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence (but not in limitation thereof), following the Effective Time, Parent

Affiliates shall keep in effect for at least one (1) year following the

date hereof with respect to such Company Employees, (ii) Parent shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, ensure that all Company Employees who were
notified of their target bonus opportunity for the current fiscal year shall

attainment of financial performance criteria and goals substantially similar
to those under the Companys current bonus program, and (iii) following the

the deferred compensation plans of the Company are not amended or terminated
in any manner that would adversely affect any participant in such plan as of
the date hereof.

 

(b)

 

Following the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall ensure that no limitations or
exclusions as to pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good
health, waiting periods or actively-at-work exclusions or other limitations or
restrictions on coverage are applicable to any Company Employees or their
dependents or beneficiaries under any welfare benefit plans in which such
employees may be eligible to participate (other than such limitations or
waiting periods applicable to such Company Employees under the Employee
Benefit Plans), and (ii) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided that any
costs or expenses incurred by Company Employees (and their dependents or
beneficiaries) up to (and including) the Effective Time (during the calendar
year the Effective Time occurs) shall be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying applicable deducible, co-payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-
pocket provisions and like adjustments or limitations on coverage under any
such welfare benefit plans.

 

(c)

 

With respect to each employee benefit plan, policy or practice, including
severance, vacation and paid time off plans, policies or practices, sponsored
or maintained by Parent or its Affiliates, Parent shall grant, or cause to be
granted to, all Company Employees from and after the Effective Time credit for
all service with the Company and the Subsidiaries, and their respective
predecessors, prior to the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting credit, eligibility to commence benefits, early
retirement subsidies and severance (but not for other purposes, including but
not limited to benefit accrual under a defined benefit plan of Parent or any
of its Affiliates), to the extent similarly situated Parent employees receive
such credit.

another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, with such individuals
heirs, executors or administrators, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided

rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until final disposition of any and all such claims.

 

(a)

 

At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
purchase and maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years thereafter,
"run-off" coverage as provided (i) by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policies and (ii) by the Companys fiduciary and employee
benefit policies, in each case, covering those Persons who are covered on the
date of this Agreement by such policies, subject to the limitations set forth
in Section 5.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter; and provided, further
that, if Parent or the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain such "run-

Corporation to maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years thereafter,

all Indemnified Parties to the extent permitted by the applicable law of the
jurisdiction of organization of the Company or the relevant Subsidiary with
respect to all acts and omissions arising out of such individuals services as

Subsidiaries or as trustees or fiduciaries of any plan for the benefit of
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, occurring prior to the

In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person

Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

 

(d)

 

The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
5.10 shall survive the Closing and shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to affect adversely any Indemnified Party to whom this Section
5.10 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being

the manner provided in Section 8.4, or in such other manner as may be

Section 8.12. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against
its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and this Agreement
shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable term, provision, covenant or restriction or
any portion thereof had never been contained herein.
