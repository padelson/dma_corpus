AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of this 26th day of June, 2017, by and between FOUR OAKS FINCORP,
INC., a North Carolina corporation (" _Seller_ " and, unless the
context otherwise requires, the term "Seller" shall include Seller and its
wholly-owned subsidiary bank, FOUR OAKS BANK and TRUST COMPANY, a North
Carolina bank (the " _Bank_ ")), and UNITED COMMUNITY BANKS, INC., a Georgia
corporation (" _Buyer_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Seller and Buyer deem it
advisable and in the best interests of each such entity and their
respective shareholders that Seller merge with and into Buyer (the " _Merger_
"), with Buyer being the surviving corporation;

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Seller and Buyer believe that
the merger of Seller and Buyer will enhance and strengthen the franchises and
future prospects of both companies and each of their subsidiary banks; and

  



  

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement
is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code;

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants and agreements herein contained, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which as legally
sufficient consideration are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I _ 
 MERGER_

  



  

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Seller shall merge with and into Buyer in
accordance with Section 55-11-06 of the North Carolina Business Corporation
Act and the Georgia Business Corporation Code, Chapter 2 of Title 14 of the
Official Code of Georgia (the " _Georgia_ _Code_ "). Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Seller shall cease, and Buyer
shall survive and continue to exist as a corporation incorporated under the
Georgia Code and shall continue under the name "United Community Banks, Inc."
Buyer shall possess all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises, as well of a public nature as of a private nature, of each
of Seller and Buyer; and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all
debts due on whatever account, and all other choses in action, and all and
every other interest of or belonging to or due to each of Seller and Buyer
shall be taken and deemed to be transferred to and vested in Buyer without
further act or deed, and the title to any real estate or any interest therein,
vested in either of Seller or Buyer shall not revert or be in any way
impaired by reason of the Merger. Buyer shall thenceforth be responsible
and liable for all the liabilities, obligations and penalties of each of
Seller and Buyer; and any claim existing or action or proceeding, civil or
criminal, pending by or against either of Seller or Buyer may be prosecuted as
if the Merger had not taken place, or Buyer may be substituted in its place,
and any judgment rendered against either of Seller or Buyer may thenceforth be
enforced against Buyer; and neither the rights of creditors nor any liens
upon the property of either of Seller or Buyer shall be impaired by
the Merger. The " _Effective Time_ " shall mean the date and time at which
the Merger shall be effective upon the filing of the certificate of merger
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Georgia Secretary of State and the
articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with the North Carolina
Secretary of State pursuant to _Section 1.4_.

  



    



 



    



  

1.2 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Buyer, Seller or the shareholders of either
of the foregoing:

  



  

(a) Each share of Buyer's common stock, $1.00 par value per share ("
_Buyer Stock_ ") that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time and shall
be unchanged by the Merger;

  



  

(b) Each share of Seller common stock, $1.00 par value per share ("
_Seller Common Stock_ ") owned directly by Buyer (other than shares in trust
accounts, managed accounts or other similar accounts for the benefit of
customers or shares held as collateral for outstanding debt previously
contracted) immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cancelled Shares_
") shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time without any
conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  



  

(c) Subject to Sections 1.2(g), each share of Seller Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than treasury stock, Dissenting Shares and Cancelled Shares) shall become and
be converted into the right to receive the following consideration, in each
case without interests: (i) an amount of cash equal to $1.90 (the " _Cash
Consideration_ "); and (ii) 0.6178 validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of Buyer Stock together with
cash in lieu of any fractional shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 1.2(g) (the " _Stock Consideration_ ", and with the Cash
Consideration, individually, the " _Per Share Purchase Price_ " and
collectively, and in the aggregate, as adjusted in accordance with the terms
hereof, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Each certificate previously
representing shares of Seller Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ")
shall thereafter represent, subject to _Section 1.3(d)_ , only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. Any reference herein to "Certificate" shall
be deemed, as appropriate, to include reference to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of shares of Seller Common Stock, and it
being further understood that provisions herein relating to
Certificates shall be interpreted in a manner that appropriately accounts for
book-entry shares, including that, in lieu of delivery of a Certificate and a
Letter of Transmittal, shares held in book-entry form may be transferred by
means of an "agent's message" to the Exchange Agent or such other evidence of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request.

  



  

(d) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to acquire shares
of Seller Common Stock (a " _Seller Stock Option_ ") issued pursuant to
Seller's equity-based compensation plans identified in _Section 3.5(a)(i)_ of
the Disclosure Memorandum (the " _Seller Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall become fully vested and shall be cancelled and converted automatically
into the right to receive a cash payment from Buyer or Buyer Bank (the "
_Cash Out Amount_ ") in an amount equal to the product of (x) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration Price (as defined below) over the exercise
price of each such Seller Stock Option and (y) the number of shares of Seller
Common Stock subject to such option to the extent not previously exercised.
After the Effective Time, any such cancelled Seller Stock Option shall no
longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only
entitle the holder to the payment of the Cash Out Amount, without interest.
In the event the exercise price per share of Seller Common Stock subject to a
Seller Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration
Price, such Seller Stock Option shall be cancelled without consideration and
have no further force or effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Merger Consideration Price_ " means the sum of (i) the Exchange Ratio
multiplied by the Closing Price and (ii) $1.90.

  



  

(e) At the Effective Time, each award of shares of Seller Common
Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction (a "
_Seller Restricted Share Award_ ") granted pursuant to the

  



    

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Seller Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become fully vested and shall
be converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in respect of each share of Seller Common Stock underlying such Seller
Restricted Share Award. Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall (i) obtain
any necessary consents or make any necessary amendments to the terms of any
outstanding Seller Restricted Share Awards and/or Seller Stock Plans to give
effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section 1.2(e)_ , (ii) take
all actions as may be necessary to terminate (and, except as provided in this
_Section 1.2(e)_ , ensure that neither Seller nor the Bank remains bound by or
liable for) any outstanding Seller Restricted Share Awards or other rights to
acquire Seller Common Stock and (iii) ensure that the Seller Stock Plans which
allow the grant of Seller Restricted Share Awards or other rights to acquire
Seller Common Stock, if any, will be amended to eliminate the ability to
grant any such Seller Restricted Share Awards or other rights to acquire
Seller Common Stock effective as of immediately after the Effective Time. At
or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (which may be in
connection with the payment of the first regular base salary payment due to
such holder following the Closing, but in any event shall occur within thirty
(30) days after the Effective Time), Buyer or Buyer Bank shall deliver the
Merger Consideration to the holders of Seller Restricted Share Awards,
without interest. Such payments may be reduced by any Taxes withheld pursuant
to _Section 1.3(g)_.

  



  

(f) At the Effective Time, each outstanding warrant to acquire
shares of Seller Common Stock shall be cancelled without consideration and
have no further force or effect.

  



  

(g) No scrip or fractional share certificates of Buyer Stock shall
be issued in connection with the Merger and an outstanding fractional share
interest will not entitle the owner thereof to vote, to receive dividends or
to have any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to such fractional
interest. In lieu of any fractional interest, there shall be paid in cash,
without interest, an amount (computed to the nearest cent) equal to such
fraction multiplied by the purchase price per share of Seller Common Stock as
determined by multiplying (i) the Exchange Ratio by (ii) the closing price
for Buyer Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market trading day immediately
preceding the Effective Time (the " _Closing Price_ ").

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, shares of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised
dissenters' rights in respect of such shares in accordance with Article 13 of
the North Carolina Business Corporation Act (such shares being referred to
collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's
dissenters' rights under applicable law with respect to such shares) shall
not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead
shall be entitled to payment of such consideration as may be determined to be
due in accordance with Article 13 of the North Carolina Business Corporation
Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's right to dissent
pursuant to Article 13 of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, or if
a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Article 13 of the North Carolina Business
Corporation Act, such shares of Seller Common Stock shall be treated as if
they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 1.2_ , without interest
thereon, upon surrender of such shares of Seller Common Stock. Seller shall
give prompt notice to Buyer of any demands received by Seller for appraisal,
of any withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served
pursuant to the North Carolina Business Corporation Act and received by
Seller relating to Article 13 of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act,
and Buyer shall direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall not, without the prior
written consent of Buyer, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do
any such appraisal demands.

(i) If either party should change the number of its outstanding
shares as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar transaction with
respect to such shares prior to the Effective Time, then the shares to be
issued hereunder to holders of Seller Common Stock shall be proportionately
and appropriately adjusted; _provided that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, no
such adjustment shall be made with regard to Buyer Stock if (i) Buyer issues
additional shares of Buyer Stock and receives consideration for such shares
in a bona fide merger, acquisition or other business combination or any other
third party transaction, or (ii) Buyer issues stock options, restricted stock
or restricted stock units or grants or similar equity awards or Buyer Stock
upon exercise or vesting of any such grants or awards.

  



  

1.3 _Delivery of the Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall appoint
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company to act as exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") and shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, for the
benefit of the holders of Seller Common Stock, for exchange in accordance
with this _Section 1.3_ , through the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates of
Buyer Stock or, at Buyer's option, evidence of shares of Buyer Stock in book
entry form (collectively, referred to herein as " _New Certificates_ ") to be
issued in exchange for the Stock Consideration, and (ii) cash in an amount
sufficient to pay (A) the aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration
and (B) cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares
in accordance with _Section 1.2(g)_ (such cash and New Certificates described
in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). Buyer shall, after the Effective Time on the appropriate
payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be provided to the
Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions represented by such
deposited shares. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund as directed by Buyer for Buyer's benefit pending payment thereof
by the Exchange Agent to the holders of Seller Common Stock pursuant to this
_Article_ I; provided that no investment of such deposited funds directed by
Buyer shall relieve Buyer or the Exchange Agent from promptly making the
payments required by this _Article_ I, and following any losses from any such
investment, Buyer shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Seller Common Stock, in the amount
of such losses, which additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same
manner as funds initially deposited with the Exchange Agent. Buyer shall
direct the Exchange Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the
former holders of Seller Common Stock and to make payments from the Exchange
Fund in accordance with this _Article_ I. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to this _Article I_ ,
except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Buyer shall direct the Exchange Agent to mail no later than five
(5) business days after the Closing Date (the mailing date of such letter of
transmittal being referred to herein as the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder
of record of Seller Common Stock as of the Effective Time: (i) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the holder's Certificate or Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to
the Exchange Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other
provisions as Buyer may reasonably specify (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ");
and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon the surrender of
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, and delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and
properly completed, with respect to such Certificates, the record holder of
such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration to be paid therefor pursuant to this _Article I_. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate.

(c) As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Seller
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Seller Common Stock on the records of Seller. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this  _Article_ I with
respect to any Seller Common Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining thereto. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior thereto shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law.

  



  

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Seller
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Seller
Common Stock with respect to the shares of Buyer Stock represented thereby,
in each case unless and until the surrender of each outstanding share of such
Seller Common Stock in accordance with this _Section 1.3_. Subject to the
effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following
surrender of any such share of such Seller Common Stock in accordance with
this _Section 1.3_ , the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive,
without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the
whole shares of Buyer Stock represented by such Seller Common Stock and paid
prior to such surrender date, and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of
Buyer Stock represented by such Seller Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date
subsequent to the issuance of the Buyer Stock issuable with respect to such
Seller Common Stock.

  



  

(e) At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective
Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental
entity), Buyer shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to
it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest or investment
income received with respect thereto) not disbursed to holders of Seller
Common Stock, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
Buyer (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates and compliance with the procedures
set forth in this _Section 1.3_ , without interest. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Buyer nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder
of Seller Common Stock for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

  



  

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Exchange Agent or Buyer, as applicable, shall issue in exchange therefor
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of Seller Common Stock formerly
represented thereby were converted pursuant to this _Article_ I; provided,
however, that the Exchange Agent, or Buyer, as applicable, may, in its
reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of
such Merger Consideration, as applicable, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a customary indemnity agreement or
provide a bond in a customary amount.

  



  

(g) Buyer and Buyer Bank are entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any individual or entity (a " _Person_ ") such amounts, if any,
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
remitted on a timely basis to the appropriate governmental authority by or on
behalf of Buyer or Buyer Bank, such amounts withheld shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

respective subsidiaries shall (i) take, or agree to take, any action that
would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying

(ii) fail to take, or agree to fail to take, any action that would
reasonably be expected to be necessary to permit the Merger to qualify as a

connection with the filing of the Form S-4, and (ii) deliver to its
respective Tax counsel and Tax advisors certificates containing

Buyer shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
documents, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary
or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in

properties or assets of Seller, or (ii) otherwise carry out the purposes of

Statement_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _1933 Act_
"), on Form S-4 covering the issuance of the shares of Buyer Stock to the

reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer Registration Statement to become

assistance as necessary in the preparation of the Buyer Registration
Statement, including, without limitation, providing Buyer with all material
facts regarding the operations, business, assets, liabilities and personnel
of Seller, together with the audited financial statements of Seller, all as
and to the extent required by the 1933 Act and the rules, regulations and
practices of the SEC, for inclusion in the Buyer Registration Statement. The

the shareholders of Seller, and Buyer shall have no obligation to cause the
Buyer Registration Statement to continue to be effective after the Effective
Time or to prepare or file any post-effective amendments to the Buyer
Registration Statement after the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) Buyer agrees to list on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, by the

2.2 _Meeting of Seller Shareholders_.

  



  

(a) Seller shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of its shareholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Buyer Registration Statement becomes effective under the
1933 Act for the purpose of submitting the Merger and this Agreement to such
shareholders for their approval. In connection with the Special Meeting,
Buyer and Seller shall together prepare and submit to the Seller shareholders
a notice of meeting, proxy statement and proxy (the " _Seller Proxy
Materials_ "), which shall include the final prospectus from the Buyer

(b) Except as provided in this _Section 2.2(b)_ , the board of
directors Seller shall (i) communicate to the shareholders of Seller

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the
" _Seller Recommendation_ ") and (ii) include the Seller Recommendation in the
Seller Proxy Materials. Neither the Seller board of directors nor any
committee thereof shall: (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Buyer, the
Seller Recommendation or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) (each, an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), except that, prior to the Requisite
Seller Shareholder Approval, Seller's board of directors may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change if:

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(A) Seller's board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with Seller's financial advisor and outside counsel, that it has
received an Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of
_Section 4.19_ ) that is a Superior Proposal;

  



  

(B) Seller's board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with Seller's outside counsel, that a failure to accept
such Superior Proposal would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of
the fiduciary duties of the members of the board of directors of Seller;

  



  

(C) Seller's board of directors provides written notice (a " _Notice
of Recommendation Change_ ") to Buyer of its receipt of the Superior Proposal
and its intent to announce an Adverse Recommendation Change on the third
business day following delivery of such notice, which notice shall specify
the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (it being
understood that any amendment to any material term of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Recommendation Change);

  



  

(D) after providing such Notice of Recommendation Change, Seller
negotiates in good faith with Buyer (if requested by Buyer) and
provides Buyer reasonable opportunity during the three (3)-business day
period following the Notice of Recommendation Change to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable Seller's board
of directors to proceed without an Adverse Recommendation Change (provided,
however, that Buyer shall not be required to propose any such adjustments);
and

  



  

(E) Seller's board of directors, following such three (3)-business
day period, determines in good faith, after consultation with
Seller's financial advisor and outside counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach
of the fiduciary duties of the members of the board of directors of Seller.

  



  

(c) The term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or
offer with respect to a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation,
dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization,
rights offering, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction,
involving Seller or any of its subsidiaries; and (ii) any acquisition by any
Person resulting in, or proposal or offer, which, if consummated, would
result in, any Person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly,
of ten percent (10%) or more of the total voting power of any class of equity
securities of Seller or any of its subsidiaries, or ten percent (10%) or more
of the consolidated total assets of Seller, in each case, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(d) The term " _Superior Proposal_ _"_ means any Acquisition
Proposal with respect to which the board of directors of Seller (i)
determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is
reasonably likely to be consummated on a timely basis, taking into account
all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal
and the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) determines in its
good faith judgment (based on, among other things, the advice of
Seller's financial advisor) to be more favorable to Seller's shareholders
than the Merger taking into account all relevant factors (including whether,
in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of Seller, after
obtaining the advice of the Seller's financial advisor, the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably able to finance the transaction and
close it timely, and any proposed changes to this Agreement that may be
proposed by Buyer in response to such Acquisition Proposal).

  



  

2.3 _Access to Properties, Books, Etc_. Seller shall allow Buyer
and its authorized representatives full access, upon reasonable prior notice,

books, contracts, commitments and records and those of its subsidiaries and
shall furnish Buyer and its authorized representatives such information
concerning its affairs and the affairs of its subsidiaries as Buyer may
reasonably request, provided that such request shall be reasonably related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not interfere
unreasonably with normal operations. Seller shall cause its and its
subsidiaries' personnel, employees and other representatives to assist Buyer
in making any such investigation. During such investigation, Buyer and
its authorized representatives shall have the right to make copies of such
records, files, tax returns and other materials as it may deem advisable and
shall advise Seller of those items of which copies are made. No investigation
made heretofore or hereafter by Buyer and its authorized representatives
shall affect the representations and warranties of Seller hereunder.

the disclosure by the other party; (b) is or becomes generally available to
the public other than by breach of this Agreement; (c) is provided by one
party for disclosure concerning such party in the Buyer Registration

Agreement on a non-confidential basis from a third party who is not under an
obligation of confidence to the other party to this Agreement. If this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, upon request each party hereto
agrees to return all documents, statements and other written
materials, whether or not confidential, and all copies thereof, provided to
it by or on behalf of the other party to this Agreement. The provisions of
this _Section 2.4_ shall survive termination, for any reason whatsoever, of
this Agreement, and, without limiting the remedies of the parties hereto in
the event of any breach of this _Section 2.4_ , the parties hereto will be
entitled to seek injunctive relief against the other party in the event of a
breach or threatened breach of this _Section 2.4_.

Agreement, the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts in
good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary or advisable so as to permit consummation of
the Merger as promptly as practicable and shall cooperate fully with each
other to that end.

  



  

2.6 _Expenses_. All of the expenses incurred by Buyer in connection
with the authorization, preparation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement, including, without limitation, all

commercially reasonable efforts to preserve its business organization and the
business organizations of its subsidiaries, to keep available the services of
its present employees and of the present employees of its subsidiaries, and

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

preserve the goodwill of customers and others having business relations with
such party or its subsidiaries.

  



  

2.8 _Approvals and Consents_. Each party hereto represents and
warrants to and covenants with the other that it will use its
commercially reasonable efforts, and will cause its officers, directors,

Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ "), the Georgia Department of
Banking and Finance (the " _GDBF_ "), the North Carolina Office of the
Commissioner of Banks (the " _NCCOB_ "), and (ii) any other approvals set
forth in _Section 3.6(a)_ and _Section 5.7(a)_ which are necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger and the Bank Merger or those the failure of which to be obtained would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Buyer (collectively, the " _Required Regulatory Approvals_
").

  



  

2.9 _Press Releases_. Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller
must each approve the form, substance and timing of any press release or
other public disclosure materially related to this Agreement or any other
transaction contemplated hereby; _provided, however,_  that nothing in this
_Section 2.9_ shall be deemed to prohibit Buyer from making any disclosure
which its counsel deems necessary or advisable in order to satisfy Buyer's
disclosure obligations imposed by law.

  



  

2.10 _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide generally to
employees of Seller who continue employment with Buyer (" _Seller Continuing
Employees_ ") medical, dental, vacation and long-term disability benefits,
medical and dependent care flexible spending accounts, severance and life
insurance (collectively, " _Employee Benefits_ "), on terms and
conditions consistent in all material respects with those then currently
provided by Buyer or Buyer Bank to its other similarly-situated
employees. For purposes of eligibility to participate and any vesting
determinations (but not benefit accruals) in connection with the provision of
any such Employee Benefits by Buyer or Buyer Bank to the Seller Continuing
Employees, service with Seller or the Bank prior to the Closing Date shall be
counted to the extent such service was counted under the similar plan of
Seller or the Bank. The Seller Continuing Employees' prior service with
Seller or the Bank shall also be credited for purposes of all waiting periods
for participation in any of such Employee Benefits to the extent such service
was counted under the similar plan of Seller or the Bank. Buyer or Buyer Bank
shall also waive all restrictions and limitations for preexisting conditions
under Buyer's Employee Benefit plans, to the extent such restrictions or
limitations would not apply to the Seller Continuing Employees under the
similar plan of Seller or the Bank. Buyer or Buyer Bank shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Seller Continuing
Employees with credit under Buyer's group health Employee Benefit plans, for
the plan year of such plans which include the Closing Date, towards any
applicable deductibles under Buyer's group health Employee Benefit plans for
the aggregate amounts paid by such employees toward applicable deductibles
under Seller's group health Employee Benefit plans for the plan year of
such plans which includes the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) Subject to applicable legal requirements, Buyer and Seller shall
take such other actions prior to the Closing Date as may be
reasonably necessary to enable the employees of Seller after the Closing Date
to rollover the amount credited to their accounts under the Seller 401(k)
Plan (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") through a rollover contribution into the
Buyer Bank, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "), if such employees
are Seller Continuing Employees, or to transfer the amount credited to their
accounts through an eligible rollover contribution to a separate third party
individual retirement account (after the deemed distribution of any
participant loans as reflected in such accounts), or to take a

  



    

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

cash distribution from the Seller 401(k) Plan (after the deemed distribution
of any participant loans as reflected in such accounts), _provided, that_
 (i) Seller's Board of Directors shall adopt resolutions to terminate the
Seller 401(k) Plan and cease all further deferrals with respect to eligible
compensation no later than the business day immediately prior to the Closing
Date, and (ii) the foregoing shall be subject to the receipt of a final
favorable IRS determination letter (or prototype sponsor letter) with respect
to the Seller 401(k) Plan to the extent reasonably required by Buyer and
completion of such other actions as may be required by applicable legal
requirements. For purposes of any vesting determinations (but not benefit
accruals) in connection with the Buyer 401(k) Plan in which any Seller
Continuing Employees may participate after the Closing, service with Seller
prior to the Closing Date shall be counted to the extent such service was
counted under the Seller 401(k) Plan. For purposes of eligibility to
participate in any matching contribution under the Buyer 401(k) Plan, Seller
Continuing Employees shall be eligible on terms and conditions
consistent with those then currently provided by Buyer to its other
similarly-situated employees as of their employment date with Buyer. Prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall make any necessary employer contributions to
the Seller 401(k) Plan due such Seller Continuing Employees for compensation
paid by Seller prior to termination of the Seller 401(k) Plan.

  



  

(c) Subject to applicable legal requirements, Buyer and Seller shall
take such other commercially reasonable actions prior to the Closing Date as
may be necessary to terminate, effective prior to Closing, the agreements
marked with an "*" on _Section 3.5(a)(i)_  of the Disclosure Memorandum
effective as of the Closing Date and any other Seller Plans that Buyer directs
Seller or the Bank to terminate prior to Closing. In connection with such
terminations, any compensation to be provided thereunder shall be paid
in full in exchange for a settlement and release agreement in a form
reasonably acceptable to Buyer to the extent requested by Buyer. Seller or
the Bank shall (i) permit Buyer to review and approve in advance any documents
or notices required to effect any of the foregoing and (ii) provide to Buyer
prior to Closing written evidence as to satisfaction of the requirements of
this _Section 2.10(c)_ as Buyer may reasonably request. Unless terminated
prior to Closing pursuant to this _Section 2.10(c)_ , Buyer shall honor any
existing employment agreements with any Seller Continuing Employees in
accordance with their terms or as otherwise amended by the parties.

  



  

2.11 _Severance Plan_. Buyer agrees that it shall provide a severance
package for all Seller Continuing Employees who are not retained by Buyer
following the Closing Date, or who are otherwise displaced by Buyer following
the Closing Date. Such severance package will be in accordance with Buyer's
existing policies and practices as they apply to similarly-situated employees
of Buyer, which currently consists of two weeks of salary for every full year
of employment with a minimum of eight (8) weeks and a maximum of fifty-two
(52) weeks. Employees with tenure of fifteen (15) years or longer will receive
fifty-two (52) weeks of severance pay. Buyer will also provide reimbursement
for COBRA benefits for up to four (4) months for those displaced employees
with fewer than fifteen (15) years of tenure with Seller and for up to six
(6) months for those with fifteen (15) years or longer tenure with Seller. In
the event that Buyer changes its severance policies in a manner that applies
to all Buyer employees, such changes shall also apply to any Seller
Continuing Employees employed by Buyer at the effective date of such change.

  



  

2.12 _Directors ' and Officers' Tail Coverage_. Prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer shall have, at Buyer's expense, amended, modified or obtained
directors' and officers' liability insurance (either through its existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies or under Seller's
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policies, in which
event Seller will designate Buyer's insurance broker as Seller's broker-of-
record, as determined by Buyer in its sole discretion) for a period of six
(6) years after the Closing Date, covering any person who is now, or has been
at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing
Date, a director or officer of Seller or the Bank, who are currently covered
by Seller's policies on terms similar to such existing insurance; _provided
that_ Buyer shall not be obligated to make aggregate annual premium payments
for such six (6)-year period in respect of such policy which

  



    

 | 11| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium payments on
Seller's current policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Maximum Amount_ "). If the amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or
procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Buyer shall use
its reasonable best efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal
to the Maximum Amount. The directors and officers of Seller and its
subsidiaries shall take all reasonable actions required by the insurance
carrier necessary to procure such endorsement.

  



  

2.13 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time (or, in
the case of Claims that have not been resolved prior to the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, until such Claims are finally
resolved), Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the present and
former directors and executive officers of Seller (each, an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") against all liabilities arising out of, resulting from or related
to any claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or other
legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(each, a " _Claim_ "), in which an Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to
be made, a party or witness arising out of the fact that such Indemnified
Party is or was a director or officer of Seller (or, at Seller's request, was
a director, officer, manager or trustee of, or in a similar capacity
with, another Seller entity or Seller Plan) prior to the Effective Time if
such Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at
or before the Effective Time (including the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed
before, or after, the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law. Buyer shall promptly pay reasonable expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) in advance of the final disposition of any such
Claim to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such advance payments if he or
she shall be adjudicated not to be entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 2.13(a)_. Buyer shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine, and such determination shall have become final and non-appealable,
that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable law (including any law promulgated,
interpreted or enforced by any regulatory authority).

  



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
paragraph (a) of this _Section 2.13_ , upon learning of any such Claim, shall
promptly notify Buyer thereof in writing (provided that a failure to timely
provide such notice shall not relieve Buyer of any indemnification obligation
unless, and to the extent that, Buyer is materially prejudiced by such
failure). In the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) Buyer shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and Buyer shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred
by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except
that if Buyer elects not to assume such defense for the Indemnified Parties,
or if there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest between
Buyer and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and Buyer shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received; _provided_ , that Buyer shall be obligated pursuant to this
_Section 2.13(b)_ to pay for only one firm of counsel for any Indemnified
Party in any jurisdiction; (ii) each Indemnified Party will cooperate in good
faith in the defense of any such Claim; (iii) Buyer shall not be liable
for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (iv) without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) Buyer shall not agree to any settlement which does not provide for a
release of the Indemnified Party.

(c) Buyer covenants and agrees that neither it, nor any successors
or assigns, shall consolidate with or merge into any other person where Buyer
or any such successor or assign shall not be the continuing or surviving
person of such consolidation or merger, or transfer all or substantially all
of its assets to any person, unless, in each case, proper provision shall have
been made to ensure that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 2.13_.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 2.13_ are intended to be for the
benefit of and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their
respective heirs and legal and personal representatives.

  



  

2.14 _Certain Litigation_. Each party shall promptly advise the other
party orally and in writing of any actual or threatened
shareholder litigation against such party and/or the members of such party's
board of directors related to this Agreement or the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall: (i) permit Buyer to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the view of Buyer
in connection with, any proposed written or oral response to such shareholder
litigation; (ii) furnish Buyer's outside legal counsel with all non-
privileged information and documents which outside legal counsel may
reasonably request in connection with such shareholder litigation; (iii)
consult with Buyer regarding the defense or settlement of any such
shareholder litigation, and (iv) not settle any such litigation prior to such
consultation and consideration; provided, however, that Seller shall not
settle any such shareholder litigation if such settlement requires the payment
of money damages, without the written consent of Buyer (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld) unless the payment of any such damages by Seller is
reasonably expected by Seller, following consultation with outside counsel, to
be fully covered (disregarding any deductible to be paid by Seller) under
Seller's existing director and officer insurance policies, including any tail
policy.

  



  

ARTICLE III _ 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF Seller_

  



  

As an inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, Seller represents and warrants as follows:

  



  

3.1 _Disclosure Memorandum_. Seller has delivered to Buyer a
memorandum (the " _Disclosure Memorandum_ ") containing certain information
regarding Seller as indicated at various places in this Agreement. All
information set forth in the Disclosure Memorandum or in documents
incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Memorandum is true, correct and
complete, does not omit to state any fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made,
not misleading, and shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to
constitute part of the representations and warranties of Seller under this
_Article III_. The information contained in Seller Exchange Act Reports and
the Disclosure Memorandum shall be deemed to qualify all representations and
warranties contained in this _Article III_ and the covenants in _Article IV_
 to the extent applicable. No item is required to be set forth in the
Disclosure Memorandum as an exception to a representation or warranty if its
absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being
deemed untrue or incorrect; the mere inclusion of an item in the Disclosure
Memorandum as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission by Seller that such item represents a material exception or
fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result
in a Material Adverse Effect; and any disclosures made with respect to a
section of _Article III_ or _Article IV_ shall qualify (i) any other section
of _Article III_ or _Article IV_ specifically referenced or cross-
referenced and (ii) other sections of _Article III_ or _Article IV_ to the
extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of
a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such other sections. Seller shall promptly provide
Buyer with written notification of any event, occurrence or other information
necessary to maintain the Disclosure Memorandum and all

the securities laws and other applicable laws and (ii) did not, at the time
they were filed (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date

(iii) Except as set forth in _Section 3.5(a)(iii)_ of the Disclosure
Memorandum, Seller and its ERISA Affiliates (as defined below) are not

or had any liability (direct or indirect, contingent, as the result of any
indemnity or guaranty or otherwise) with respect to (A) a multiemployer plan
as defined in Section 3(37)(A) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, (B) an employee
benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to
Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 or 430 of the Code, (C) a
multiple employer plan within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code or

_Section 3.5(a)(iii)_ , the term " _ERISA Affiliate_ " shall mean any
person within the meaning of Section 3(9) of ERISA, or any trade or business
(whether or not incorporated), that, together with Seller or the Bank, would
be treated at the relevant time as a single employer within the meaning of
Section 414 of the Code or 4001(a) of ERISA.

  



  

(iv) Each Seller Plan has been established, operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and in accordance with,
and has been amended to comply with (unless such amendment is not yet
required), all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, without
limitation, ERISA, the Code, and the regulations issued under ERISA and the
Code. With respect to each Seller Plan, other than routine claims for
benefits submitted in the ordinary course of the benefits process and in
accordance with the express terms of such Seller Plans, no litigation or
administrative or other proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of
Seller, threatened involving such Seller Plan or any of its assets or
fiduciaries. With respect to each Seller Plan, neither Seller, the Bank nor
any of their directors, officers, employees or agents or any fiduciary of any
Seller Plan has been engaged in or been a party to any transaction relating
to the Seller Plan which could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach
of fiduciary duty under ERISA or a " _prohibited transaction_ " (as such term
is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code), unless such
transaction is specifically permitted under Sections 407 or 408 of ERISA,
Section 4975 of the Code or a class or administrative exemption issued by the
Department of Labor. Each Seller Plan that is a group health plan within the
meaning of Section 607(l) of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code is in
material compliance with (i) the continuation coverage requirements of
Section 501 of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code and other applicable laws
and (ii) the applicable requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, as amended.

remittances required by such plan or applicable law have been made, or will
be made, on a timely basis.

  



  

(vi) Each Seller Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code, and its related trust, respectively, has received a
favorable determination letter (or opinion letter) from the Internal Revenue
Service (" _IRS_ ") as to the qualification of such plan and

  



    

 | 29| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

the tax-exempt status of the related trust (or has filed with the IRS a
request for such a determination letter within the applicable
remedial amendment period or is a prototype plan for which the prototype plan
sponsor has received a favorable opinion letter or advisory opinion from the
IRS as to the qualification of the prototype plan on which Seller may rely)
and, to the knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred, and no condition
exists, that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualified
or tax exempt status or the imposition of any liability, tax or penalty under
ERISA or the Code.

  



  

(vii) Seller does not provide and has no obligation to provide
benefits, including, without limitation, death, health, post-retirement
life insurance or medical benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to
current or former employees of Seller or the Bank or their spouses,
dependents or beneficiaries beyond the employees' retirement or other
termination of employment or service with Seller or the Bank other than
coverage mandated by applicable law and at the sole expense of such employees
or their spouses, dependents or beneficiaries.

  



  

(viii) Except as set forth in _Section 3.5(a)(viii)_ of the Disclosure
Memorandum, neither this Agreement nor any transaction contemplated hereby
(either alone or in combination with any other event) will: (i) entitle any
current or former employee, officer, director or other service provider of
Seller or the Bank to any payment or benefit, including any bonus, retention,
severance pay, retirement pay, unemployment compensation or any similar or
other payment; (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of, or
increase the amount of compensation or benefits due any such employee,
officer, director or other service provider; (iii) increase any benefits, or
accelerate the time of payment or any benefits, otherwise payable under any
Seller Plan (iv) trigger any material obligation under any Seller Plan,
including any funding thereof; or (v) cause the payment of any "excess
parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code). No Seller Plan
provides for the gross up of taxes under Code Sections 409A or 4999.

  



  

(ix) Each Seller Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code
has been maintained in written form, and administered and operated in
compliance in all material respects, with Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations and rulings thereunder.

  



  

(x) There is no audit or investigation pending with respect to any
Seller Plan before any governmental authority and, to the knowledge
of Seller, no such audit or investigation is threatened.

  



  

(xi) Seller has properly accrued on its financial statements in all
material respects, the correct number of days, for all vacation, sick
leave, personal time and paid time off credited to Seller or the Bank
employees and individual consultants as of the date of such
financial statements. Seller or the Bank has, for each Seller Plan and all
other purposes, including taxes and participation in Seller Plans, correctly
classified all natural persons and, if applicable, their disregarded entities,
providing services to Seller as common law employees or independent
contractors as appropriate.

  



  

(xii) Neither Seller nor the Bank has entered into any commitment to
modify or amend any Seller Plan (other than in the ordinary course and
consistent with past practices or as required by law) or to establish any new
benefit plan, program or arrangement. There has been no amendment to any
Seller Plan, interpretation or announcement by Seller or the Bank relating to
any Seller Plan or written notice or arrangement, or change in eligibility,
participation or coverage under any Seller Plan, that would increase the
expense of maintaining any such Seller

  



    

 | 30| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Plan above the level of expense incurred or with respect to such Seller Plan
for the most-recently completed fiscal year of Seller and the Bank.

  



  

(xiii) Each pension plan, within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA,
that is not intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is
exempt from Parts 2, 3 and 4 of ERISA as an unfunded plan that is maintained
primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select
group of management or highly compensated employees pursuant to Sections
201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. No assets of any such pension plan
have been set aside to pay the obligations under such pension plan in a rabbi
trust or otherwise.

  



  

(b) _Employment and Labor Matters_. Seller is not, and has not
been, a party to any collective bargaining agreement or agreement of any kind
with any union or labor organization or to any agreement with any of its

the election of, and without cost or penalty to, Seller. Seller has not
received at any time in the past five (5) years, any demand for recognition
from any union, and no attempt has been made, to organize any of its
employees. Seller has complied in all material respects with all obligations
under the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, as amended, and all other federal, state and local labor laws

3.5(b)_ of the Disclosure Memorandum, (i) there are no unfair labor practice
charges pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller,
and (ii) there are, and in the past three (3) years there have been, no
charges, complaints, claims or proceedings, pending, or to the knowledge of
Seller, threatened against, or involving, as the case may be, Seller with
respect to any alleged violation of any wage and hour laws, age discrimination
act laws, employment discrimination laws or any other claims arising out of
any employment relationship as to any of Seller's employees or as to any
person seeking employment therefrom, and no such violations exist. All
employees and independent contractors of Seller are properly classified as
such for all purposes, including without limitation, the Seller Plans.

  



  

(c) _Related Party Transactions_. Except for: (i) loans and
extensions of credit made on substantially the same terms, including
interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions by Seller with other Persons who are not affiliated with Seller,
and which do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present
other unfavorable features; (ii) deposits, all of which are on terms and
conditions identical to those made available to all customers of Seller at the
time such deposits were entered into; and (iii) transactions specifically
described in _Section 3.5(c)_ of the Disclosure Memorandum, there are no

Buyer; or

have, to the knowledge of Buyer, any unasserted contingent liabilities.

  



  

5.6 _Compliance_. Other than investments to satisfy regulatory
requirements, neither Buyer nor Buyer Bank is a party to any agreement with
any individual or group regarding Community Reinvestment Act matters and, to
its knowledge, no facts or circumstances exist, which would cause Buyer Bank:
(i) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance with the Community
Reinvestment Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be
assigned a rating for Community Reinvestment Act purposes by federal or state
bank regulators of lower than "satisfactory"; (ii) to be deemed to be
operating in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing
regulations (31 C.F.R. Part 103), the USA PATRIOT Act, any order issued with
respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's
Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money
laundering statute, rule or regulation; the Truth in Lending Act and
Regulation Z, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,
any regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or

  



    

 | 37| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

any regulations relating to unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices
under federal or state law; or (iii) to be deemed not to be in
satisfactory compliance with the applicable privacy of customer information
requirements contained in any federal and state privacy laws and regulations,
including, without limitation, in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of
1999 and regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions of the
information security program adopted by Buyer Bank pursuant to 12 C.F.R. Part
364. Furthermore, the board of directors of Buyer Bank has adopted and Buyer
Bank has implemented an anti-money laundering program that contains adequate
and appropriate customer identification verification procedures that has not
been deemed ineffective by any governmental agency and that meets the
requirements of Sections 352 and 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act.

WITNESSETH:

  



  

WHEREAS, Four Oaks Fincorp, Inc. (" _Seller_ "), and United Community Banks,
Inc. (" _Buyer_ "), entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger
dated as of the date hereof (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), which provides for
the merger of Seller with and into Buyer (the " _Buyer Merger_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Constituent Banks deem it
advisable and in the best interests of each such bank and its shareholders
that the Bank merge with and into Buyer Bank, with Buyer Bank being the
surviving bank; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Constituent Banks, by
resolutions duly adopted, have unanimously approved and adopted
this Agreement and directed that it be submitted to the sole shareholder of
each of the Bank and Buyer Bank for their approval;

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual warranties,
representations, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, and other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

Pursuant to and with the effects provided in the applicable provisions of
Article 2 of the Financial Institutions Code of Georgia, Chapter 1 of Title 7
of the Official Code of Georgia (the " _Georgia Code_ ") and Chapter 53C of
the North Carolina General Statutes, the Bank (sometimes referred to as the "
_Merged Bank_ ") shall be merged with and into Buyer Bank (the " _Bank
Merger_ "). Buyer Bank shall be the surviving bank (the " _Surviving Bank_
") and shall continue under the name " _United Community Bank_." At the
Effective Time (as defined herein) of the Bank Merger, the individual
existence of the Merged Bank shall cease and terminate.

  



  

2. Actions to be Taken.

  



  

The acts and things required to be done by the Georgia Code in order to make
this Agreement effective, including the submission of this Agreement to the
shareholders of the Constituent Banks and the filing of the articles of merger
relating hereto in the manner provided in said Georgia Code, shall be
attended to and done by the proper officers of the Constituent Banks with the
assistance of counsel as soon as practicable.

  



  

3. Effective Time.

  



  

The Bank Merger shall be effective upon the filing of the articles of merger
in the manner provided in the Georgia Code (the " _Effective Time_ "). The
Bank Merger shall not be effective prior to the

  



    



 



    



  

effective time of the Buyer Merger.

  



  

4. Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Bank.

  



  

(a) The Articles of Incorporation of Buyer Bank, as heretofore
amended, as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Bank.

  



  

(b) Until altered, amended or repealed, as therein provided, the
Bylaws of Buyer Bank as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
Bylaws of the Surviving Bank.

  



  

5. Directors.

  



  

Upon the Bank Merger contemplated herein becoming effective, the directors of
the Surviving Bank shall be the individuals set forth on _Attachment 1_
hereto. Said persons shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the
shareholder of the Surviving Bank and until their successors are elected in
accordance with the Bylaws of the Surviving Bank. If at the Effective Time any
vacancy shall exist on the Board of Directors of the Surviving Bank, such
vacancy shall be filled in the manner specified in the Bylaws of the
Surviving Bank.

  



  

6. Cancellation of Shares of Merged Bank; Capital Structure of the Surviving Bank.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each share of the Merged Bank's common
stock (the " _Bank Stock_ ") outstanding at the Effective Time shall be
cancelled.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, each share of the Surviving Bank's common
stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain outstanding.

  



  

7. Termination of Separate Existence.

  



  

At the Effective Time, the separate existence of the Merged Bank shall cease
and the Surviving Bank shall possess all of the rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises, as well of a public nature as of a private
nature, of each of the Constituent Banks; and all property, real, personal
and mixed, and all debts due on whatever account, and all other choses in
action, and all and every other interest of or belonging to or due to each of
the Constituent Banks shall be taken and deemed to be vested in the Surviving
Bank without further act or deed, and the title to any real estate or any
interest therein, vested in either of the Constituent Banks shall not
revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the Bank Merger. The Surviving
Bank shall thenceforth be responsible and liable for all the liabilities,
obligations and penalties of each of the Constituent Banks; and any claim
existing or action or proceeding, civil or criminal, pending by or against
either of said Constituent Banks may be prosecuted as if the Bank Merger had
not taken place, or the Surviving Bank may be substituted in its place, and
any judgment rendered against either of the Constituent Banks may
thenceforth be enforced against the Surviving Bank; and neither the rights of
creditors nor any liens upon the property of either of the Constituent Banks
shall be impaired by the Bank Merger.

  



  

8. Further Assignments.

  



  

If at any time the Surviving Bank shall consider or be advised that any
further assignments or assurances in law or any other things are necessary or
desirable to vest in said bank, according to the terms hereof, the title to
any property or rights of the Merged Bank, the proper officers and directors
of the Merged Bank shall and will execute and make all such proper assignments
and assurances and do all things necessary and proper to vest title in such
property or rights in the Surviving Bank, and otherwise to

carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

9. Condition Precedent to Consummation of the Merger.

of the Bank.

  



  

10. Termination.

of merger by the Secretary of State of Georgia or the Secretary of State of
North Carolina with respect to the Bank Merger in accordance with the
provisions of the Georgia Code or the North Carolina General Statutes, as
applicable. This Agreement shall automatically be terminated upon a
termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof.

  



  

11. Counterparts; Title; Headings.

  



  

This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. The title of this Agreement and the
headings herein set out are for the convenience of reference only and shall
not be deemed a part of this Agreement.

  



  

12. Amendments; Additional Agreements.

  



  

At any time before or after approval and adoption by the shareholder of the
Bank, this Agreement may be modified, amended or supplemented by
additional agreements, articles or certificates as may be determined in the
judgment of the respective Boards of Directors of the Constituent Banks to be
necessary, desirable or expedient to further the purposes of this Agreement,
to clarify the intention of the parties, to add to or modify the covenants,
terms or conditions contained herein or to effectuate or facilitate any
governmental approval of the Bank Merger or this Agreement, or otherwise to
effectuate or facilitate the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that no such modification,
amendment or supplement shall reduce to any extent the consideration into
which shares of the Bank Stock shall be converted in the Bank Merger pursuant
to Section 6 hereof.
