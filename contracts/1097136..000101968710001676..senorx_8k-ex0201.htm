NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE 1 
 

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

1.01 The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.02), subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company (the "Merger"). Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation")
and shall continue to be governed by the Laws (as defined in Section 3.06) of
the State of Delaware.

  

  

1.02 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on the
Closing Date, the Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time
as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to
as the "Effective Time").

  

  

1.03 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
herein, in the Certificate of Merger and in the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company and Merger Sub.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

   
 

1.04 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(a) Subject to the requirements of Section 5.06, at the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to read as the certificate of incorporation of Merger
Sub, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall not be amended
and, as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter further amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law.

  

  

(b) Subject to the requirements of Section 5.06, at the Effective Time, the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its
entirety to read as the bylaws of Merger Sub, except that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall not be amended and, as so amended and restated,
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter further
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

  

1.05 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death,
resignation or removal, in accordance with applicable Law and the Surviving
Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

  

  

1.06 Closing. Subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement and unless
this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Article VII, the
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place (a) at the offices of
Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York at 10:00
a.m., on the Business Day that is most promptly practicable following the date
of the satisfaction (or waiver if permissible) of all of the conditions set
forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions), but in no event later than the second (2nd) Business Day
following such date or (b) at such other place and time and/or on such other
date as the Company and Parent may agree in writing. The date on which the
Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date."

  

  

ARTICLE 2 
 

  

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

  

OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB

  

  

2.01 Effect on Shares of Capital Stock.

  

  

(a) Common Shares of the Company. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Common Shares,
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, each Common Share that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Dissenting
Shares, and (ii) Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(b))
shall be automatically canceled and extinguished and converted into the right
to receive $11.00 per share in cash (the "Merger Consideration"), payable to
the holder thereof, without interest or dividends thereon, less any applicable
withholding of Taxes (as defined in Section 3.13(g)), in the manner provided
in Section 2.03. All such Common Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and each holder of such Common Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions, if any that are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.01(a).

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) Cancellation of Certain Common Shares. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Common
Shares, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, each Common Share that is owned by
the Company as treasury stock or otherwise owned by Merger Sub or Parent shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  

  

(c) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of Merger Sub common
stock, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, each share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Shares") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and non assessable share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation ("Surviving Corporation
Common Shares"), with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so
converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented issued and outstanding Merger Sub Common Shares
shall, from and after the Effective Time, automatically and without the
necessity of presenting the same for exchange, represent the shares of the
Surviving Corporation capital stock into which such shares have been converted
pursuant to the terms hereof; provided, however, that the record holder
thereof shall receive, upon surrender of any such certificate, a certificate
representing the Surviving Corporation Common Shares into which the Merger Sub
Common Shares formerly represented thereby shall have been converted pursuant
to the terms hereof.

  

  

(d) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
(a "Dissenting Stockholder") and who has properly demanded appraisal for such
Common Shares in accordance with the DGCL (each, a "Dissenting Shares") shall
not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration at the
Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.01(a) hereof, but shall represent
and become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be
due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the Laws of the State of
Delaware, unless and until such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses such holder's right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL.
If a Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect appraisal rights in accordance
with the DGCL, or if such holder withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's
right to appraisal, such former Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive, upon surrender as provided above, the Merger Consideration,
without any interest or dividends thereon, in accordance with Section 2.01(a).
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Common Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in and, after the Effective Time,
to direct, all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as
required under the DGCL, make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

   
 

2.02 Equity Awards.

  

  

(a) Options.

  

  

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Option" means any option to
purchase or acquire Common Shares (other than the Warrants), including any
option granted under the Company's 1998 Stock Option Plan and 2006 Equity
Incentive Plan (as amended and restated February 26, 2009) (collectively, the
"Stock Plans").

  

  

(ii) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any holder thereof, each Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent then
unvested, become fully vested and exercisable and shall be canceled, in each
case, in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the Stock Plans and
related award agreements under which such Options were granted. In
consideration of such cancellation, each holder of an Option that has a per-
share exercise price less than the Merger Consideration, if any, will be
entitled to receive in settlement of such Option as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, a cash payment from the Surviving Corporation,
subject to any required withholding of Taxes, equal to the product of (i) the
total number of Common Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of such Option
and (ii) the Merger Consideration less the applicable exercise price per
Common Share of such Option (the "Option Consideration"). Any Option with a
per-share exercise price that equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration shall
be canceled and no payment shall be made in respect thereof.

  

  

(b) Restricted Stock. As of the Effective Time, each then-outstanding share of
restricted stock ("Restricted Stock"), including any Restricted Stock
previously issued by the Company pursuant to the terms of any of the Stock
Plans and/or any applicable restricted stock award or restricted stock
purchase agreement, shall be converted into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation, as promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration (the "Restricted
Stock Consideration"), less any applicable withholding Taxes, and when so
converted will be automatically canceled and will cease to exist.

(c) Restricted Stock Units. As of the Effective Time, each then-outstanding
restricted stock unit (each, a "Restricted Stock Unit"), including any
Restricted Stock Unit previously issued by the Company pursuant to the terms
of any of the Stock Plans and/or any applicable restricted stock unit award,
shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation,
as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, an amount in cash
equal to the Merger Consideration that the holder would have been entitled to
receive had such Restricted Stock Unit vested in full and settled immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "RSU Consideration"), less any applicable
withholding Taxes, and when so converted will be automatically canceled and
will cease to exist.

  

  

(d) Warrants.

  

  

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Warrant" means any warrant to
purchase or acquire Common Shares issued pursuant to the: (A) Venture Lending
and Leasing IV, Inc. warrant agreement, dated December 27, 2004, (B) Steve M.
Parker warrant agreement, dated December 14, 2004 and (C) Lloyd Malchow

"Warrant Agreement").

  

  

(ii) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any holder thereof, each Warrant that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent then
unvested, become fully vested and exercisable and shall be canceled, in each
case, in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of any Warrant Agreement
and related award agreements under which such Warrants were granted. In
consideration of such cancellation, each holder of a Warrant that has a per-
share exercise price less than the Merger Consideration, if any, will be
entitled to receive in settlement of such Warrant, as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, a cash payment from the Surviving Corporation,
subject to any required withholding of Taxes, equal to the product of (i) the
total number of Common Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of such Warrant
and (ii) the Merger Consideration less the applicable exercise price per
Common Share of such Warrant (the "Warrant Consideration"). Any Warrant with a
per-share exercise price that equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration shall
be canceled and no payment shall be made in respect thereof.

  

  

(e) Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

  

  

(i) The Company has taken all actions necessary and sufficient, including, in
accordance with Section 20(a) and Section 4 of the SenoRx, Inc. Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP"), to provide that no new Offering Period (as
defined in the Company ESPP) under the Company ESPP will commence on and after
May 15, 2010 (the date upon which the Offering Period underway as of the date
of this Agreement will end pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Company
ESPP), unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article 7.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(ii) Each Common Share purchased under the Company ESPP and outstanding prior
to the Effective Time will be treated as a Common Share in accordance with
Section 2.01.

  

  

(iii) No offering period under the Company ESPP shall commence on or after the
date of this Agreement. The Company shall take all actions necessary and
sufficient in accordance with applicable Law and the Company ESPP (including
delivering all required notices and passing necessary resolutions of the
Company Board and any applicable committee thereof) to effect the foregoing,
so that the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective
Time. All amounts withheld by the Company on behalf of the participants in the
Company ESPP that have not been used to purchase Common Shares prior to the
Effective Time will be returned to the participants without interest pursuant
to the terms of the Company ESPP.

  

  

(f) Payment. Promptly following the Effective Time, but in no event more than
one (1) Business Day following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
Parent shall otherwise take all steps necessary to cause to be deposited, by

Fund"), (B) the aggregate Restricted Stock Consideration payable to all
holders of Restricted Stock pursuant to Section 2.02(b) (the "Restricted Stock
Fund"), (C) the aggregate RSU Consideration payable to all holders of
Restricted Stock Units pursuant to Section 2.02(c) (the "RSU Fund") and (D)
the aggregate Warrant Consideration payable to all holders of Warrants

Restricted Stock Fund, the RSU Fund and the Warrant Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose except as provided in this Agreement.

  

  

(g) Company Action. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary and sufficient in accordance with applicable Law, the
Company ESPP, the Stock Plans and, as applicable, the terms of each Option
award agreement, Warrant Agreement, Restricted Stock award or purchase
agreement and Restricted Stock Unit award agreement (including delivering all
required notices and passing necessary resolutions of the Company Board and
any applicable committee thereof), in each case, to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including this Section 2.02).
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to ensure that the Company will not, at the Effective Time, be bound by any
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock rights, restricted stock
units, phantom equity awards, warrants or other rights or agreements which
would entitle any Person, other than Parent and its subsidiaries, to own any
equity interest in the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in
respect thereof. The Company shall take all actions necessary and sufficient
to terminate the Company ESPP and all of its Stock Plans, such termination to
be effective at the Effective Time.

2.03 Payment for Common Shares in the Merger.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall appoint a commercial bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange and
paying agent, registrar and transfer agent (the "Agent") to facilitate the
receipt by the Company's stockholders of the Merger Consideration. Promptly
following the Effective Time, but in no event more than one (1) Business Day
following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or Parent shall otherwise
take all steps necessary to cause to be deposited, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, in trust with the Agent for the benefit of the
holders of Common Shares, cash in an aggregate amount equal to the product of
(i) the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.01(a) and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the
"Payment Fund"). The Agent shall, pursuant to instructions provided by Parent,
make the payments provided for in Section 2.01 of this Agreement out of the
Payment Fund (it being understood that any and all interest earned on funds
made available to the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to
the Surviving Corporation). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose except as provided in this Agreement.

  

  

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Agent to mail to each Person who was, as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Common
Shares (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form) which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the certificates representing the Common Shares (the "Certificates") or
uncertificated Common Shares represented by book entry ("Uncertificated
Shares") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer
of the Uncertificated Shares to the Agent and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering such Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares and
receiving the Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

  

  

(c) Upon (i) surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal validly executed and duly completed
in accordance with the instructions thereto or (ii) compliance with the
reasonable procedures established by the Agent for delivery of Uncertificated
Shares, the holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be
entitled to receive, in exchange therefor, in the case of Common Shares (other
than Dissenting Shares or Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section
2.01(b)), cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Common
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, as
applicable, and (ii) the Merger Consideration, which amount shall be paid by
the Agent by check in accordance with the instructions provided by such
holder. No interest or dividends will be paid or accrued on the consideration
payable upon the surrender of any Certificate or transfer of any
Uncertificated Share. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect of the applicable Common Shares may be made to
a Person (other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered or
the Uncertificated Shares so transferred is registered) if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Shares shall be properly transferred. The Person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof or such Person shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered or transferred, as the case
may be, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.03, each
Certificate or Uncertificated Share (other than those representing Dissenting
Shares or Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(b)) shall
represent, for all purposes, only the right to receive cash in an amount equal
to the product of (i) the number of Common Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, as applicable and (ii) the Merger
Consideration, without any interest or dividends thereon.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) The consideration issued upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Common
Shares formerly represented thereby. After the Effective Time, there shall be
no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any
Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this Article 2.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any amounts that may be payable
to the former stockholders of the Company in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company
upon the nine (9) month anniversary of the Closing Date shall be returned to
the Surviving Corporation upon demand and any former stockholders of the
Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter
look, subject to Section 2.03(f), to the Surviving Corporation only as general
unsecured creditors thereof for payment of any Merger Consideration, without
any interest or dividends thereon, that may be payable in respect of each
Common Share held by such stockholder. Following the Closing, the Agent shall
retain the right to invest and reinvest the Payment Fund, on behalf of the
Surviving Corporation, in securities listed or guaranteed by the United States
government or as otherwise directed by the Surviving Corporation, and the
Surviving Corporation shall receive the interest earned thereon. Nothing
contained in this Agreement and no investment losses resulting from the
investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of
Common Shares to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Agreement.

  

  

(f) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Agent shall be liable to a
holder of Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or any other Person in respect
of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have
been surrendered or any Uncertificated Shares shall not have been transferred
by the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date (or immediately prior to
such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration, dividends (whether in
cash, stock or property) or other distributions with respect to Common Shares
in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Authority (as defined in Section
3.06(b)), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of
all Claims (as defined in Section 3.10) or interests of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation) of that fact by the Person (who shall be the record
owner of such Certificate) claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such amount as the Agent may direct as indemnity against any Claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect of the Common Shares formerly represented
by such Certificate as contemplated by this Article 2.

  

  

(h) Each of the Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder
of Common Shares, Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or
Warrants pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any applicable
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by the
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such former holder of
Common Shares, Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or Warrants,
provided that the withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate
taxing authority.

Adverse Effect has occurred as described in any other clause in this
definition of "Excluded Matter"; (E) any fact, circumstance, effect, event,
change or occurrence resulting from a change after the date of this Agreement
in accounting rules or procedures announced with respect to United States

operations or any change in analyst recommendations, for any period, provided
that this clause (F) shall not preclude any fact, circumstance, effect, event,
change or occurrence that may have contributed to or caused such failures from
being taken into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse
Effect has occurred, unless such fact, circumstance, effect, event, change or
occurrence is itself not to be considered in the determination of whether a
Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred as described in any other clause
in this definition of "Excluded Matter"; (G) any fact, circumstance, effect,
event, change or occurrence attributable to the execution, performance or
announcement of this Agreement including (I) the identity of Parent, (II) the

with any of its customers, suppliers, distributors, landlords, licensors,
licensees or other business partners, provided that this clause (G) shall not
preclude any legal or contractual consequences of the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions from being taken into
account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred;
(H) any action taken or failed to be taken by the Company at the request or
with the consent of Parent, that, if taken without the request or the consent
of Parent, would have been prohibited by the terms of this Agreement or (I)
any legal proceedings made or brought by any of the current or former
stockholders of the Company (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company)
against the Company or any of its directors or officers, including legal
proceedings arising out of the Merger or in connection with any of the other
Transactions; but only in the case of the foregoing clauses (A), (B), (C) or

Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Shares
entitled to vote thereon (the "Stockholder Approval"), to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the

(a) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the Transactions will not: (i) conflict with or violate any
provision of the Company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws; (ii)
assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and other actions

which any asset of the Company is bound or affected; (iii) conflict with,
result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with or
without notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give
to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation
of, or require any payment under, or give rise to a loss of any benefit to
which the Company is entitled under, any provision of any contract,
instrument, Permit, concession, franchise, license, loan or credit agreement,
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other property agreement,

or Lien would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not, and
the performance of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or Permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any domestic (federal, state or local)
or foreign or multi-national government or governmental, regulatory or
administrative authority, agency, commission, board, bureau, quasi-
governmental organization, body (including notified bodies), court or
instrumentality or arbitrator of any kind ("Governmental Authority"), or any

applicable notification requirement with respect to the various transactions
contemplated under Section 2.02 and Section 2.03 with respect to the Stock
Plans and/or Benefit Plans and (iii) where the failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or Permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to impair in any material respect the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations hereunder, or prevent or materially impede, interfere
with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Transaction.

(c) The Company does not have any material liabilities or obligations of any
kind or nature required to be reflected or reserved against on a balance sheet
prepared in accordance with GAAP, except liabilities or obligations (i) fully
reflected on or reserved against in the Company's balance sheet as of December
31, 2009 (the "Balance Sheet Date") included in the Company's SEC Reports

a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar
Contract or arrangement (including any Contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction or relationship between the Company, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate on the other hand), including any "off-balance sheet
arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the
SEC)).

(e) The Company is not indebted to any director or officer of the Company
(except for amounts due as normal salaries and bonuses or in reimbursement of
ordinary business expenses and directors' fees, in each case, in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices) and no such Person is

proxy statement filed with the SEC and the date of this Agreement, there have
been no other transactions of the type required to be disclosed pursuant to
Item 402 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

  

  

(f) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)
promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act) reasonably designed to ensure
that all information (both financial and non-financial) relating to the
Company required to be disclosed by the Company in the SEC Reports (i) is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and (ii) are effective to ensure that information is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC. The Company's principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Company
Board (i) all significant deficiencies that have been identified in the design
or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the Company's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have

effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2009, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts
or circumstances that would prevent the Company's principal executive officer
and principal financial officer from giving the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

been filed, to (i) agreements, documents or other instruments which previously
have been filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or
(ii) the Company's SEC Reports. The Company has delivered or made available to
Parent true, correct and complete copies of all correspondence with the SEC
occurring since January 1, 2007 and prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(i) The audit committee of the Company Board has established "whistleblower"
procedures that meet the requirements of Exchange Act Rule 10A-3, and the
Company has made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of such
procedures. No complaint seeking relief under Section 806 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act has been filed with the United States Secretary of Labor and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no employee has threatened to file any such
complaint.

  

  

3.08 Compliance with Applicable Laws. The Company is in compliance with, and
is not in default or violation of, any Law, or any consent decree, executive
order or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent
(collectively, "Order") applicable to it, or by which any of its properties or
assets are bound and the business operations of the Company have been
conducted in compliance with all Laws of each Governmental Authority; except,
in each case, for any such non compliance, defaults or violations that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Since January 1, 2007, the Company has not received written notice to the
effect that a Governmental Authority claimed or alleged that the Company was
not in compliance with all Laws and Orders applicable to the Company, any of
the Company's properties or assets or any of the Company's business

3.09 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement, since the Balance Sheet Date and prior to the date hereof, (i)
the Company has conducted its business in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, (ii) there has not
been a Company Material Adverse Effect and (iii) the Company has not taken or
permitted to occur any action that, were it to be taken from and after the
date of this Agreement without the approval of Parent, would constitute a
breach of Section 5.01(a).

Governmental Authority in respect of which the Company has received notice,
whether written or oral, and to the Company's Knowledge, no Claim,
investigation or inquiry threatened in writing, in each case, against the
Company, at law or in equity, that individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
is not, as of the date of this Agreement, subject to any Order by or before
any Governmental Authority that is material to the Company. Since January 1,
2007, the Company has not been a defendant in any Claim or inquiry involving
product liability or warranty claims, in each case, with respect to the
Company's products, and since such date, to the Company's Knowledge, no such
Claim or inquiry has been threatened. There are no settlement or similar

with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement"), to be
filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger, will, when filed, comply as

first mailed to the stockholders of the Company, and at the time such
stockholders vote on adoption of this Agreement, the Proxy Statement, as
supplemented or amended, if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. At the time of the filing of any Company Disclosure
Document other than the Proxy Statement and at the time of any distribution
thereof, such Company Disclosure Document will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The representations and warranties
contained in this Section 3.11(b) will not apply to statements included in or

complete list of (i) all "employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3)
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"))
and (ii) all other employee benefit plans, programs, agreements, policies,
arrangements or payroll practices, including bonus plans, employment,
individual consulting or other compensation agreements, collective bargaining
agreements, equity or equity-based compensation, employee stock ownership,
employee loan, or deferred compensation arrangements, change in control,

fringe benefit plans, arrangements or practices, whether or not subject to
ERISA, oral or written, in each case of (i) and (ii), sponsored, maintained,
or contributed to by, or required to be contributed to by, the Company for the
benefit of any current or former director, officer, employee or independent
contractor of the Company, or to which the Company has or could have any
liability, contingent or otherwise, including as a result of its or their
ERISA Affiliates (the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the
"Benefit Plans").

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies
of the following documents (or a description thereof to the extent no writing
exists), to the extent applicable, (i) all Benefit Plans, including any plan
documents and related trust documents, insurance contracts or other funding
arrangements, and all amendments thereto, (ii) the most recent Forms 5500 and
all schedules thereto, (iii) the most recent actuarial reports, (iv) the most
recent Internal Revenue Service determination letters and (v) the most recent
summary plan descriptions and any other material communications to current or
former directors, employees, officers or independent contractors regarding the
extent or level of benefits thereunder.

  

  

(c) All Benefit Plans intended to be qualified plans may either rely on
opinion letters issued for the form of plan or have been the subject of
favorable determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service to the
effect that such Benefit Plans are qualified and exempt from federal income
Taxes under Section 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code. No such
determination letter has been revoked and nothing has occurred with respect to
the operation of the Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to cause
the loss of such qualification or exemption, or the imposition of any material
liability, penalty or Tax under ERISA or the Code.

  

  

(d) None of the Benefit Plans is, and neither the Company nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has in the last six (6) years maintained, contributed to, had an
obligation to contribute to, or had any liability in respect of, a Title IV
Plan. Each Benefit Plan and all related trusts, insurance Contracts and funds
has been maintained, funded and administered in all material respects in
accordance with the terms of such Benefit Plan and in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Laws, and each Benefit Plan which is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code has been established
and maintained in compliance, in all material respects, with Section 409A of
the Code. All payments (including payments to any participant (or their
beneficiaries) and premium payments) and contributions (including all employer
contributions and employee salary reduction contributions) required to have
been made under the terms of such Benefit Plan, under any funds or trusts
established under such Benefit Plan, any related insurance Contract or any
applicable Law, have been made by the due date thereof (including any valid
extension), and all payments and contributions for any period ending on or
before the Effective Time which are not yet due will have been paid or accrued
on the Company's balance sheet on or prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(e) With respect to each Benefit Plan, (i) no Claims or inquires (other than
routine Claims or inquiries for benefits in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices) are pending, or to the Company's Knowledge,
threatened against the Benefit Plans, the assets of any of the trusts under
such plans or the plan sponsor or administrator, or against any fiduciary of
the Benefit Plans, in each case, with respect to the operation of the Benefit
Plans and (ii) to the Company's Knowledge, no facts or circumstances exist
that could give rise to any such Claims or inquiries.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(f) The Company has no obligation to provide, nor do any of the Benefit Plans
provide, for post-employment health or life insurance, benefits or coverage
for any Person, except as specifically required under the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), or similar state Law
and at the sole expense of such Person.

  

  

(g) Each Option granted by the Company (i) was granted with a per share
exercise price equal to or greater than the per share fair market value of the
Company's underlying Common Shares on the date of grant thereof and no such
Option has a feature for the deferral of compensation, in each case, within
the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and other guidance
issued thereunder ("Section 409A") or satisfies the "grandfather" rules for
stock options under Section 409A and (ii) which was intended to be an
incentive stock option (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code) was
granted pursuant to a Benefit Plan which meets the requirements of Section 422
of the Code.

  

  

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transactions will, either alone or in connection with any other
event(s), (i) result in any payment becoming due to any current or former
director, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company, (ii)
increase any amount of compensation or benefits otherwise payable under any
Benefit Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, funding
or vesting of any benefits under any Benefit Plan, (iv) require any
contributions or payments to fund any obligations under any Benefit Plan, (v)
limit the right to merge, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan (except any
limitations imposed by Law, if any) or (vi) give rise to any amount that would
not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code. No Benefit Plan or other
agreement with any employee provides for a "gross-up" or similar payment in
respect of any Taxes that may become payable under Section 409A or Section
4999 of the Code.

  

  

(i) There is no Contract or other arrangement or plan (including any Benefit
Plan) by or with the Company covering any Person that, individually or
collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount by the Company that
would not be deductible by the Company or the Surviving Corporation by reason
of Section 162(m) of the Code.

  

  

(j) Each current or former director, officer, employee or independent
contractor of the Company has been, and is, properly classified as an
employee, independent contractor or consultant under applicable Law, except
for any failure to be so classified that would not give rise to a material
liability to the Company. The Company has no direct or indirect liability with
respect to any misclassification of any current or former director, officer,
employee or independent contractor of the Company as an independent contractor
rather than as an employee, as a part-time employee rather than a full-time
employee, or with respect to any employee leased from another employer, except
for any such liability that would not give rise to a material liability to the
Company.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(k) No Benefit Plan is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United
States, or covers any employee residing or working outside the United States.

which any Tax may be assessed or collected by any taxing authority; and (v) no
written (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, oral) claim has been made by any
taxing authority in a jurisdiction where the Company does not file Tax Returns
that the Company is or may be subject to taxation in that jurisdiction, other
than such claims which would not reasonably be expected to be material.

pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall affect any representations, warranties,
covenants, conditions, remedies or rights of the parties hereto contained in
this Agreement.

5.05 Public Announcements. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement,
each of Parent and the Company may issue a press release, in each case, in a
form mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company announcing the execution of
this Agreement and the Transactions. Thereafter, each of Parent and Merger
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, hereby agrees to (a)
consult promptly with the other party prior to issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger and the
Transactions and (b) provide to the other party for review a copy of any such
press release or statement, and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement prior to such consultation and review by the other
party, unless required by applicable Law or rules and regulations of any
securities exchange, in which case the party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.05 shall not apply to
any release or announcement made or proposed to be made by the Company
following a Recommendation Change.

  

  

5.06 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

  

  

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) cause the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and director exculpation substantially similar to
those set forth in the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in
effect at the date of this Agreement (to the extent consistent with applicable
Law), which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Persons
who at any time prior to the Effective Time were entitled to indemnification,
advancement of expenses or exculpation under the Company's certificate of
incorporation or bylaws in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including the Transactions), unless otherwise
required by applicable Law. In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company under those indemnification agreements
set forth on Section 5.06(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) From and after the Effective Time and until the expiration of any
applicable statutes of limitation, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law (but subject to Section 5.06(c)), the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each Person who is or has been prior to the date of this
Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer, director,
employee or agent of the Company (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties")
against all losses, Claims, damages, judgments, fines, fees and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and investigation expenses), liabilities
or amounts that are paid in settlement of, or otherwise incurred ("Losses")
(but only to the extent such Losses are not otherwise covered by insurance and
paid), in connection with any Claim, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to which any Indemnified Party is or may become a party to
by virtue of his or her service as a present or former director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company and arising out of actual or alleged events,
actions or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the Transactions), in each case, to the fullest
extent permitted under the DGCL and provided in the Company's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws as in effect at the date of this Agreement (and shall
pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of the Claim(s) that are
reasonably incurred in defending any such Claim to each Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL as provided in the Company's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect at the date of this
Agreement, upon receipt from the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced of the undertaking to repay such advances contemplated by the DGCL).

  

  

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
5.06 after the Effective Time, upon learning of any such Claim, shall notify
the Surviving Corporation thereof; provided, however, the failure to so notify
the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation from any
liability that the Surviving Corporation may have under this Section 5.06,
except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the Surviving
Corporation. In the event of any such Claim, the Surviving Corporation shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Surviving
Corporation elects not to assume such defense or if there is an actual or
potential conflict of interest between, or different defenses exist for the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation and the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Party promptly as statements therefor are received
by the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that (i) the Surviving
Corporation shall not, in connection with any such Claim or separate but
substantially similar Claims arising out of the same general allegations, be
liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys
at any time for all Indemnified Parties, (ii) the Surviving Corporation and
the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
(iii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent and (iv) neither the Surviving
Corporation nor any of its affiliates (including Parent) shall settle or
otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any Claim, investigation or inquiry for which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Party under this Agreement,
without such Indemnified Party's prior written consent, unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional
release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such
claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry; and provided, further, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) Effective upon the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be purchased and
maintained a six (6) year "tail" prepaid liability insurance policy in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering
each Person currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy on terms, including with respect to coverage and
amount, no less favorable to such directors and officers than those of such
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that in no
event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 200%
of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and
provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  

  

(e) This Section 5.06 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Indemnified Parties referred to herein, their heirs, legal representatives,
successors, assigns and personal representatives and shall be binding on the
Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns. The provisions of this
Section 5.06 are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification that the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and personal
representatives may have by contract or otherwise.

  

  

(f) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, as a condition to such
consolidation, merger, transfer or conveyance, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume
and agree to perform the obligations set forth in this Section 5.06.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

   
 

5.07 Further Assurances; Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier
of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 7 or the Effective
Time, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and
use (and shall cause its subsidiaries and affiliates to use) commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all such actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, all such things as may be necessary or appropriate in
order to effectuate, as expeditiously as practicable, the Merger and the
Transactions, including causing the conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article 6 to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
the Company shall not be required prior to the Effective Time to pay any
consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration (including
increased rent or other payments), or to provide any additional security
(including a guaranty), to obtain the consent of any third party under any
Contract.

  

  

5.08 Third Party Standstill Agreements. From the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 7 or the
Effective Time, (a) the Company shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive
any provision of any confidentiality or standstill Contract to which the
Company is a party (other than involving Parent or its affiliates) and (b) the
Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the
provisions of any such Contracts, including seeking injunctions to prevent any
breaches of such agreements or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof in a court in the United States or any state thereof having
jurisdiction.

  

  

5.09 No Solicitation.

  

  

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 7, the
Company and its officers and directors shall not, and the Company shall cause
the Company Representatives not to, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing information or assistance), or take any other
action to facilitate, any inquiry in connection with, or the making of any
proposal from any Person that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.09(f)), (ii)
maintain or continue, or enter into or participate in, any discussion or
negotiation with any Person (other than Merger Sub, Parent or any of the
Parent Representatives, as applicable) regarding an Acquisition Proposal, or
furnish to any Person (other than Merger Sub, Parent or any of the Parent
Representatives, as applicable) any information or otherwise cooperate in any
way with, or assist or participate in, any effort or attempt by any other
Person (other than Merger Sub, Parent or any of the Parent Representatives, as
applicable) to make or effect an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) (A) except as
set forth in Section 5.09(b), withdraw or modify (in a manner adverse to
Parent) its approval or favorable recommendation of this Agreement and the
Merger, or approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or (B) enter
into any Contract, arrangement or understanding with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement);
provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 5.09 or any other
provision of this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board, directly or
indirectly through the Company Representatives, prior to obtaining the
Stockholder Approval, from furnishing non-public information to, or entering
into or participating in discussions or negotiations with, any Person that
makes an unsolicited written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal (which did not
result from a breach of this Section 5.09) that provides for per Common Share
consideration that is greater than the Merger Consideration if (A) the Company
Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal
counsel that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law, (B) prior
to entering into or participating in discussions with such Person, the Company
Board determines in good

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

   
 

faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and the Financial
Advisor or other independent financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 5.09(g)) and
(C) prior to furnishing any non-public information to, or entering into or
participating in discussions or negotiations with, such Person, (x) the
Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality Contract (which
Contract shall be provided to Parent for informational purposes) with terms no
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, it being understood and agreed that such confidentiality Contract
need not contain a "standstill" or other similar provision that prohibits such
third party from making any proposal to acquire the Company, acquire
securities of the Company or nominate for election members of the Company
Board (such confidentiality Contract, an "Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement") and (y) concurrently with its delivery to such Person, the Company
delivers to Parent and Merger Sub all such information not previously provided
to Parent and Merger Sub.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.02(a), the
Company Board may, prior to Stockholder Approval at the Stockholders Meeting,
(x) withdraw or modify (in a manner adverse to Parent) its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger, (y) approve or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal or (z) recommend that the stockholders of the Company
reject this Agreement or the Merger (each Company Board action set forth in
clauses (x) through (z) of this Section is referred to herein as a
"Recommendation Change") if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and the Financial Advisor or other
independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided, that prior to
reaching such conclusions (A) the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
effect such Recommendation Change relating to such Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under
applicable Law; (B) the Company shall have notified Parent in writing that it
intends to effect such Recommendation Change relating to such Superior
Proposal, attaching the current version of the definitive agreement relating
to such Superior Proposal (a "Superior Proposal Notice") (it being understood
that the Superior Proposal Notice shall not constitute a Recommendation Change
for purposes of this Agreement); (C) if requested by Parent, the Company shall
have made the Company Representatives available to discuss with the Parent
Representatives, and to negotiate in good faith with the Parent
Representatives, any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement during the three (3) Business Day period following delivery by
the Company to Parent of such Superior Proposal Notice; and (D) if Parent
shall have delivered to the Company during such three (3) Business Day period
a written, binding and irrevocable (through the expiration of such three (3)
Business Day period) offer which is set forth in a definitive written
amendment to this Agreement delivered to the Company and executed on behalf of
Parent and Merger Sub, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that the Acquisition
Proposal giving rise to such Superior Proposal Notice continues to constitute
a Superior Proposal. If the Company Board shall have determined that such
Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal or if the terms
of any Acquisition Proposal are modified in any material respect, then, in
each case, any such modified Acquisition Proposal from the party that
submitted such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Superior Proposal
Notice and a new three (3) Business Day period as set forth above.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) The Company (i) will promptly (and in no event later than within 24 hours)
notify Parent orally and in writing of the receipt by the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or request for discussion regarding an
Acquisition Proposal including any request for information, the terms and
conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the identity
of the Person making such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry (including
copies of any document or correspondence evidencing such Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry) and (ii) will keep Parent informed of any material changes
(including any changes to price, merger consideration, financing terms, if
any, and closing conditions) to any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Representatives
not to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that would restrict the Company's ability to provide such
information relating to the Company to Parent, and the Company is not
currently a party to any Contract that prohibits the Company from providing
the information relating to the Company described in this Section 5.09(c) to
Parent.

  

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company Board from
(i) taking, and disclosing to the Company's stockholders, a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
with regard to any tender offer or exchange offer that is an Acquisition
Proposal or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders that the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law,
so long as the Company at least one (1) Business Day prior to making such
disclosure notifies Parent (or as soon as possible if notifying Parent at
least one (1) Business Day prior to making such disclosure is impractical)
and, if requested in writing by Parent, such disclosure shall contain a
reaffirmation of the Company Board's recommendation to the stockholders of the
Company to approve and adopt this Agreement; provided, however, if Parent
requests reaffirmation in writing and the Company fails to make such
reaffirmation in such disclosure, then such failure shall be deemed to be a
Recommendation Change; provided further, that none of the Company, the Company
Board or any Company Representative, except as permitted by Section 5.09(b),
shall propose to approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or make a
Recommendation Change. For the avoidance of doubt, a "stop, look or listen"
communication by the Company Board to the Company's stockholders pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any substantially similar communication,
shall not be deemed to be a Recommendation Change.

  

  

(e) The Company shall immediately cease, and cause each Company Representative
to immediately cease, any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties (other than Merger Sub, Parent or any of the
Parent Representatives, as applicable) conducted heretofore with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly request any such parties in
possession of confidential information about the Company that was furnished by
or on behalf of the Company in connection with such Acquisition Proposal to
return or destroy all such information in the possession of any such party or
its representatives.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any
offer or proposal for a merger, acquisition, recapitalization, consolidation,
tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction involving, or any proposal
or offer to purchase or acquire in any manner (A) assets representing 20% or
more of the assets of the Company or (B) an equity interest in 20% or more of
the voting securities of the Company, other than the Transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

  

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any
Acquisition Proposal by a Person other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective affiliates (substituting 50% for the 20% thresholds set forth in
the definition of "Acquisition Proposal") that the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and the
Financial Advisor or other independent financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, and taking into account all financial, regulatory,
legal and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, (i) is more favorable
from a financial point of view to the Company's stockholders than the Merger
(including any adjustment to the terms and conditions thereof proposed in
writing by Parent in response to any such Acquisition Proposal) and which such
Acquisition Proposal, if it includes non-cash consideration, would result in
the receipt by the Company's stockholders of consideration economically
superior to the consideration such holders are to receive in the Merger; (ii)
is reasonably capable of being consummated no later than nine (9) months from
the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal; and (iii) for which financing, to
the extent required, is then fully committed.

  

  

5.10 Termination of Registration. Each of the parties hereto agrees to
cooperate with the other party in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions
reasonably necessary to terminate the registration of the Common Shares under
the Exchange Act; provided that such termination shall not be effective until
or after the Effective Time.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

   
 

5.11 Employment Matters.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor the change in control
agreements set forth on Section 5.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided, that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit Parent from
amending or terminating, or from causing the Surviving Corporation to amend or
terminate, any such change in control agreement in accordance with its terms
or if otherwise required by applicable Law (with the consent of the employee
covered by any such change in control agreement if required).

  

  

(b) Until the date which is three (3) months after the Effective Time, Parent
shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each individual
who is actively employed by the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time and who remains an employee of the Surviving Corporation during such
period (each, a "Continuing Employee"), (i) at least the same level of base
salary or regular wages and (ii) employee benefits that are no less favorable
in the aggregate, than those provided by the Company to Continuing Employees
generally immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Benefit
Plans (excluding any change in control and equity benefits). Following the
Effective Time, Parent agrees that the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Surviving Corporation's employee benefit plans established following the
Effective Time (if any) and any other employee benefit plans covering
Continuing Employees following the Effective Time (collectively, the "Post-
Closing Plans") to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee (to the
extent such service was recognized by the Company) with the Company prior to
the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
only; provided, however, that such service need not and shall not be credited
for new Parent equity-based awards or for benefit accrual purposes under any
Post-Closing Plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, for the calendar year including the Effective Time: (i) each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all Post-Closing Plans (other than the Benefit Plans)
to the extent coverage under any such Post-Closing Plan replaces coverage
under a comparable Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates
immediately before the Effective Time; (ii) the Continuing Employees and his
or her covered dependents shall not be required to satisfy any deductible, co-
payment, out-of-pocket maximum or similar requirements under the Post-Closing
Plans that provide medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability
benefits (collectively, the "Post-Closing Welfare Plans") to the extent of
amounts previously credited for such purposes under comparable Benefit Plans
that provide medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability
benefits (the "Company Welfare Plans"); and (iii) any waiting periods, pre-
existing condition exclusions, and evidence of insurability requirements
contained in such Post-Closing Welfare Plans shall be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents (except to the extent
any such waiting period, pre-existing condition exclusion, or evidence of
insurability requirement was in effect with respect to such individual and had
not been satisfied under the applicable Company Welfare Plan in which the
individual then participates or participated as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time). Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Current PTO Liability") shall be credited to such Continuing Employee
following the Effective Time.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, (ii) be
construed as an amendment of any employee benefit plan or policy of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or their affiliates, or (iii) create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent of such employee or former employee) of the Company
in respect of their employment or any other matter.

  

  

5.12 Merger Sub. Parent will take all action necessary (a) to cause Merger Sub
to perform its obligations under this Agreement to consummate the Merger on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) to ensure that,
prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business or make
any investments other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

5.13 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall promptly advise Parent in
writing of any Claim brought by any stockholder of the Company against the
Company and/or its directors (in their capacity as such) relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions. Each of the parties hereto shall give the
others the reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of any
stockholder Claim against the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable,
and their respective directors (in their capacity as such) relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions. The Company shall not settle any Claim
currently pending, or commenced after the date of this Agreement, against the
Company or any of its directors (in their capacity as such) by any stockholder
of the Company or holder of any Options, Warrants, Restricted Stock or
Restricted Stock Units relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, in each
case, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

5.14 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all such steps as may be reasonably necessary and permitted to cause the
Transactions, including any dispositions of Company Shares (including
derivative securities with respect to such Common Shares and including the
deemed disposition and cancellation of the Options in the Merger) by each
individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

5.15 State Takeover Statutes. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover Laws
in the United States (including Section 203 of the DGCL) is or may become
applicable to the Transactions, the parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby, which efforts shall include the Company Board taking all
actions permitted under Applicable Law to render such statutes inapplicable to
the Transactions.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

   
 

5.16 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to
the Company of (a) any written notice or other communication received from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is required in connection with
the Transactions, (b) any notice from any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Transactions, (c) any actions, suits, Claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to such party's Knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its
subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions, (d) the discovery of any fact
or circumstance, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, that would
reasonably be expected to cause (i) any representation or warranty made by
such party contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality or
"Company Material Adverse Effect" or "Parent Material Adverse Effect," as
applicable, to be untrue or inaccurate (ii) any representation or warranty
made by such party contained in this Agreement that is not qualified as to
materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" or "Parent Material Adverse
Effect," as applicable, to be untrue or inaccurate in any manner that would
cause the condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) or Section 6.03(a), as the
case may be, to not be satisfied or (iii) any other condition to the Merger
set forth in Article 6 to be incapable of being satisfied prior to the
Expiration Date, and (e) any material failure of such party to comply with or
satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.16 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any
other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the
party receiving such notice.

  

  

5.17 Retention Agreements. Parent shall provide certain employees individual
retention agreements prepared by Parent (the "Retention Agreements"); provided
that no Retention Agreement shall require the Company to make any payments to
any employees prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall (i) assist
Parent, as and to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, in the creation
of the Retention Agreements, (ii) provide Parent with such information
regarding its employees as may be reasonably requested by Parent for such
purposes, which information may include employee names, addresses, titles,
compensation and current equity holdings, (iii) provide Parent access to the
Company's employees and (iv) cause a duly authorized officer of the Company to
execute the Retention Agreements on behalf of the Company. In the event any
employees shall enter into Retention Agreements, from the date of entering
into the Retention Agreements until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article 7 or the Effective Time, the Company shall not
terminate, amend, withdraw, revoke, modify or waive any provision of any
Retention Agreement without Parent\'s prior written approval

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

   
 

5.18 Corrective Action Plan. The Company shall in all material respects comply
with and implement the corrective action plans set forth on Section 5.18 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided, however, that this Section 5.18
shall have no effect following the occurrence of a Warning Letter Event, in
which case Parent's sole and exclusive recourse shall be a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.03(c)(i) with concurrent payment of the
Reverse Break Up Fee pursuant to Section 8.01(d).

  

  

ARTICLE 6 
 

  

  

CONDITIONS TO CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER

  

  

6.01 Conditions to the Obligations of Each Party. The respective obligations
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are subject to
the satisfaction or waiver (where permissible under applicable Law), at or
before the Effective Time, of each of the following conditions:

  

  

(a) Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall have obtained Stockholder

or in any of the jurisdictions set forth in Section 6.01(b) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule (the "Identified Jurisdictions"), shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law or Order that is then in
effect and that has the effect of preventing or prohibiting the consummation
of the Merger or otherwise imposing material limitations on the ability of
Merger Sub and Parent to effectively acquire, hold or operate the business of
the Company or Parent; provided, however, that each of the parties hereto
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to appeal any such Order or
otherwise have any such Order vacated or removed; and

  

  

(c) Antitrust Approvals. (i) Any waiting period (and any extension thereof)
under the HSR Act shall have expired or terminated and (ii) any waiting period

56  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects
as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the
extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier
date, in which case as of such earlier date), except that any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties will be disregarded if the circumstances
giving rise to all such inaccuracies (considered collectively) do not
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect (other than (i) the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.02, 3.03 (except as set
forth in clause (ii) below), 3.04, 3.05, 3.18, 3.19 and 3.20 which shall be

except for insignificant deviations in numerical amounts set forth in the
second, third and fourth sentence of Section 3.03, in each case, as of the
Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent
such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in
which case as if made as of such earlier date)); provided, however, that for
purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties,
all "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and other materiality
qualifications, and any similar qualifications, contained in such
representations and warranties shall be disregarded;

  

  

(b) Covenants and Agreements. The Company shall have, in all material
respects, performed all obligations and complied with all agreements and

shall not have occurred any Company Material Adverse Effect which is then
continuing. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may not assert that the

circumstance, effect, event, change or occurrence giving rise to such Company
Material Adverse Effect was disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule;

  

  

(d) Officers' Certificate. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver an
Officers' Certificate, duly executed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer

by the Company in writing prior to the Effective Time:

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct in
all respects as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date
(except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to
an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), except that any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties will be disregarded if the
circumstances giving rise to all such inaccuracies (considered collectively)
do not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect (other than the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.03 and Section 4.05,
which shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing
Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date); provided, however, that for
purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties,
all "Parent Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and other materiality
qualifications, and any similar qualifications, contained in such
representations and warranties shall be disregarded;

  

  

(b) Covenants and Agreements. Each of Merger Sub and Parent shall have, in all
material respects, performed all obligations and complied with all agreements
and covenants required to be performed by them or complied with by them under
this Agreement at or prior to the Effective Time; and

ARTICLE 7 
 

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

7.01 Termination by Mutual Consent. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger and other Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Effective Time, before or after Stockholder Approval, by the mutual written
consent of the Company (acting under the direction of the Company Board) and
Parent.

  

  

7.02 Termination by Parent or the Company. This Agreement may be terminated
and the Merger and other Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to
the Effective Time, before or after Stockholder Approval, by Parent, on the
one hand, or the Company, acting under the direction of the Company Board, on
the other hand, if:

  

  

(a) any Governmental Authority shall have (i) notified Parent or Company, or
shall have announced, that it has voted to challenge the consummation or
legality of the Merger in a judicial or administrative proceeding; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.02(a) shall not be available to any party that has failed to perform in all
material respects its obligations under Section 5.03, Section 5.07 or the
proviso contained in Section 6.01(b); or (ii) issued or entered any Order that
is in effect and has the effect of preventing or prohibiting the consummation
of the Merger;

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before six (6) months
from the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that if on such date, all
of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 6, other than (x) any of
the conditions that by their nature are only to be satisfied at the Effective
Time and (y) any of the conditions set forth in or Section 6.01(b) and Section
6.01(c) (but solely, in the case of Section 6.01(b), to the extent the matter
giving rise to the failure of such condition is related to Antitrust Laws),
have been satisfied or waived in writing, then at the election of either the
Company or Parent, such date shall be extended for up to three (3) months
(such date, as may be so extended, the "Expiration Date"); provided, however,
that Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
consummate any necessary Non-Material Divestiture prior to the Expiration
Date; and provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 7.02(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to
perform any covenant or obligation under this Agreement has been the principal
cause of or principally resulted in the failure of the Merger to have been
consummated on or before the Expiration Date; or

  

  

(c) upon a vote at a duly held Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournment
or postponement thereof) to obtain Stockholder Approval in accordance with
this Agreement, Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained.

  

  

7.03 Termination by Parent. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
and other Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time, before or after Stockholder Approval, by Parent, if:

  

  

(a) the Company shall have breached any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement or any such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this
Agreement (in either case, a "Terminating Company Breach") and such
Terminating Company Breach (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in Section 6.02(a) or Section 6.02(b) and (ii) has not been cured
within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is received by the
Company; provided that Parent shall have no right to terminate this Agreement
in connection with a Terminating Company Breach if there is an uncured
Terminating Merger Sub Breach at the time of the Terminating Company Breach or
at the time of the purported termination in connection with a Terminating
Company Breach;

  

  

(b) a Recommendation Change shall have occurred; or

  

  

(c) the Company (i) receives any warning letter, or similar written notice, or
correspondence from the FDA or any other Governmental Authority regulating
medical devices, relating to quality issues, that in the opinion of Parent,
would reasonably be expected to materially impair, or lead to actions that
materially impair, the business of the Company (a "Warning Letter Event");
provided that concurrently with and as a condition to the termination of this
Agreement, Parent pays the Reverse Break Fee, and/or (ii) receives notice of,
or is subject to, any consent decree relating to FDA regulatory or quality
issues.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

   
 

7.04 Termination by the Company. This Agreement may be terminated by the
Company, acting under the direction of the Company Board, and the Merger and
other Transactions may be abandoned if:

  

  

(a) at any time prior to the Effective Time, before or after Stockholder
Approval, Merger Sub or Parent shall have breached any of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement or any such representation or warranty shall have become untrue
after the date of this Agreement (in either case, a "Terminating Merger Sub
Breach") and such Terminating Merger Sub Breach (i) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) or Section 6.03(b) and
(ii) is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is
received by Merger Sub and Parent; provided that the Company shall have no
right to terminate this Agreement in connection with a Terminating Merger Sub
Breach if there is an uncured Terminating Company Breach at the time of the
Terminating Merger Sub Breach or at the time of the purported termination in
connection with a Terminating Merger Sub Breach; or

  

  

(b) at any time prior to Stockholder Approval, (i) a valid Recommendation
Change shall have occurred after the Company shall have complied with the
procedures set forth in Section 5.09(b) and (ii) concurrently with and as a
condition to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.04(b), the Company enters into a definitive Contract relating to an
Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of Section 5.09 that
constitutes a Superior Proposal and pays Parent the Break Up Fee (as defined
in Section 8.01(b)).

  

  

7.05 Effect of Termination. Any proper and valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this Article 7 shall be effective immediately upon the delivery of
written notice of the terminating party to the other party or parties hereto,
as applicable. In the event of the termination of this Agreement and
abandonment of the Merger and other Transactions pursuant to this Article 7,
this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect,
without any liability on the part of any party or its officers, directors,
stockholders, affiliates and agents, other than the provisions of the third to
last and penultimate sentences of Section 5.04 and the provisions of Sections
5.05, 7.05, and Article 8; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
relieve any party hereto from liability for fraud or any intentional or
willful breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

ARTICLE 8 
 

  

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

8.01 Payment of Fees and Expenses.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 8.01(b) or as otherwise specified in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall bear its own Expenses incurred by
or on behalf of such party in preparing for, entering into and carrying out
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the Transactions.
"Expenses" as used in this Agreement shall include all out of pocket expenses
(including all fees and expenses of outside counsel, investment bankers,
banks, other financial institutions, accountants, financial printers, experts
and consultants to a party hereto) incurred by a party or on its behalf in
connection with or related to the investigation, due diligence examination,
authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and the Transactions and all other matters contemplated by this
Agreement, together with any out of pocket costs and expenses incurred by any
party in enforcing any of its rights set forth in this Agreement, whether
pursuant to litigation or otherwise.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company or by Parent pursuant
to Section 7.02(b) or Section 7.02(c) and prior to the Stockholders Meeting,
an Acquisition Proposal (which, for purposes of this Section 8.01(b)(i), shall
have the meaning set forth in the definition of Acquisition Proposal contained
in Section 5.09(f), except that all references to "20% or more" shall be
deemed references to "more than 50%") shall have been made (other than by
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates) directly to the holders of
Common Shares or shall otherwise have been publicly known and such Acquisition
Proposal had not been withdrawn at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, and
at any time within twelve (12) months after such termination, either the
Company has entered into a definitive Contract relating to any Acquisition
Proposal or a transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal has been
consummated, (ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.03(b) or (iii) by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.04(b), then the Company shall (A) in the case of
subparagraph (i), pay to Parent the Break Up Fee (as defined below) within two
(2) Business Days after the event that triggers the obligation to pay the
Break Up Fee, (B) in the case of subparagraph (ii), pay to Parent the Break Up
Fee within two (2) Business Days following such termination of this Agreement
and (C) in the case of subparagraph (iii), pay to Parent the Break Up Fee
concurrently with such termination of this Agreement. "Break Up Fee" means
cash in immediately available funds in an amount equal to $9,000,000.

  

  

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.03(a)
based on a breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in
this Agreement (but for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any breach of
representations or warranties), then the Company shall promptly, and in any
event within two (2) Business Days following receipt of documentation
therefor, pay to Parent all of the Expenses of Parent and Merger Sub. If this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.03(a) based on a
breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement
(but for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any breach of representations or
warranties) and prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal (which, for
purposes of this Section 8.01(c), shall have the meaning set forth in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal contained in Section 5.09(f), except that
all references to "20% or more" shall be deemed references to "more than 50%")
shall have been made (other than by Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
affiliates) directly to the holders of Common Shares or shall otherwise have
been publicly known and such Acquisition Proposal had not been withdrawn at
the time of such termination, and at any time within twelve (12) months after
such termination, either the Company has entered into a definitive Contract
relating to any Acquisition Proposal or a transaction contemplated by any
Acquisition Proposal has been consummated, then the Company shall pay to
Parent the Break Up Fee within two (2) Business Days after the event that
triggers the obligation to pay the Break Up Fee, provided that the Expenses
payable by the Company to Parent pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) shall be
credited against such Break Up Fee payable by the Company to Parent. If this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.04(a) based on a
breach of any covenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement (but for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any breach of
representations or warranties), then Parent shall promptly, and in any event
within two (2) Business Days following receipt of documentation therefor, pay
to the Company all of the Expenses of the Company.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent as a result of a Warning Letter
Event pursuant to Section 7.03(c)(i), then Parent shall concurrently with and
as a condition to such termination, pay to the Company the Reverse Break Up
Fee and, in such case, the Company hereby expressly waives the right to
contest Parent's opinion that the quality issues referenced in the applicable
warning letter, or similar written notice, or correspondence from the FDA or
any other Governmental Authority regulating medical devices that the Company
receives would reasonably be expected to materially impair, or lead to actions
that materially impair, the business of the Company. "Reverse Break Up Fee"
means cash in immediately available funds in an amount equal to $9,000,000.

  

  

(e) The parties agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.01 are
an integral part of the Transactions and constitute liquidated damages and not
a penalty. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, (i) if Parent receives the Break Up Fee (and subject to Parent's and
Merger Sub's rights to specifically enforce this Agreement as set forth in
Section 8.11 if Parent challenges the right of the Company to terminate the
Agreement) the parties hereto agree that the payment contemplated by Section
8.01(b) and Section 8.01(c) represents the exclusive remedy of Parent and
Merger Sub in the circumstances described therein and that, except for the
payment expressly set forth in the circumstances described therein, none of
the Company or any of its respective affiliates shall have any liability or
obligation of any kind whatsoever arising out of such termination of this
Agreement, any breach by the Company giving rise to such termination, or the
failure of the Transactions to be consummated as a result of such termination,
whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise and (ii) if the Company
receives the Reverse Break Up Fee, the parties hereto agree that the Reverse
Break Up Fee represents the exclusive remedy of the Company for a valid
termination by Parent pursuant to Section 7.03(c)(i) and that, except for the
payment of the Reverse Break Up Fee, none of Parent or any of its respective
affiliates shall have any liability or obligation of any kind whatsoever
arising out of such termination of this Agreement, any breach by Parent giving
rise to such termination, or the failure of the Transactions to be consummated
as a result of such termination, whether arising in contract, equity, tort or
otherwise.

  

  

(f) All amounts payable by a party under this Section 8.01 shall be paid in
cash and in immediately available funds to such account as the other party may
designate in writing. In the event that (A) the Company shall fail to pay the
Break Up Fee or Parent's and Merger Sub's Expenses required pursuant to this
Section 8.01 when due or (B) Parent shall fail to pay the Company's Expenses
required pursuant to this Section 8.01 when due, then, in each case, such
Break Up Fee or Expenses, as the case may be, shall accrue interest for the
period commencing on the date such Break Up Fee or Expenses, as the case may
be, became past due, at the prime rate, as published in the next edition of
The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, to be published after such delivery,
as the "prime rate" at large U.S. money center banks (which rate shall be
adjusted on the effective date of each change in such rate). If the Company
shall fail to pay the Break Up Fee or Expenses, as the case may be, when due,
the Company shall also pay to the Parent all of the Parent's costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with efforts to collect
such Break Up Fee or Expenses, as the case may be. If the Parent shall fail to
pay the Expenses when due, Parent shall also pay to the Company all of the
Company's costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with
efforts to collect such Expenses.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

   
 

8.02 No Survival. The representations, warranties and agreements made in this
Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive
beyond the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Article 7 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
agreements set forth in Article 1, Article 2, Article 8 and Section 5.06 shall
survive the Effective Time and the agreements set forth in Article 8 and those
sections set forth in Section 7.05 shall survive termination.

  

  

8.03 Modification or Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time before or after Stockholder Approval; provided, however,
that after Stockholder Approval there shall not be made any amendment that by
Law requires the further approval by such stockholders without such further
approval by such stockholders; and provided, further, that the provisions of
Section 5.06 may not be amended or modified after the Closing without the
prior written agreement of each of the Indemnified Parties. Without limiting
the foregoing, this Agreement may not be amended or modified except by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties.

  

  

8.04 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedules and the instruments referred to herein that are executed
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR
THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT
AND MERGER SUB, ON THE ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS
ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party (except that
each of Parent and Merger Sub may assign its rights, interests and obligations
to any of their respective controlled affiliates or direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiaries without the consent of the Company, so long as they remain
primarily obligated with respect to any such assigned obligation). Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

   
 

8.05 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

  

8.06 Notices. Except with respect to delivery of notices contemplated by
Section 5.01, all notices, requests, Claims, demands and other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (i)
one Business Day after being sent for next business day delivery, fees
prepaid, via a reputable nationwide overnight courier service, or (ii)

8.11 Specific Performance. 
 

  

(a) Except as described in Section 8.11(b), the parties hereto recognize and
agree that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached,
immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money
damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree
that, except as described in Section 8.11(b), in addition to other remedies
available to them, the parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance
of the terms hereof. In the event that any action shall be brought in equity
to enforce the provisions of this Agreement no party shall allege, and each
party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.
Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

  

  

(b) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent as a result of a Warning
Letter Event pursuant to Section 7.03(c)(i), the parties hereto agree that the
Company shall not be entitled to seek specific performance of this Agreement.

  

  

8.12 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, a party may

conditions contained in this Agreement; provided, however, in each case, any
extension or waiver pursuant to this Section 8.12 shall not be deemed, or
operate as, a continuing extension or waiver. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, in the
event (but only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, in the federal courts of the United States located in the State of
Delaware ("Delaware Courts"), in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that, subject to
rights with respect to post trial motions and rights of appeal or other
avenues of review, a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement in the Delaware Courts. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of such action or proceeding in any such court.
