 **(e) Net Cash Adjustment**.

 



 

 **(i) **The Closing Date Merger Consideration shall be adjusted by the amount
of Estimated Closing Date Net Cash (it being understood that if such amount is

number, such amount shall be subtracted) (the amount of such increase or

and Closing Date Net Cash shall be determined as follows:

 



 

 **(1) **Within ten (10) business days prior to the estimated Closing Date,
such date to be mutually agreed upon by the parties (the " ** _Estimated
Closing Date_** "), the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement (the " **
_Estimated Closing Date Net Cash Statement_** ") that sets forth the Companys
estimate of Net Cash as of the Estimated Closing Date (the " ** _Estimated
Closing Date Net Cash_** "). The Estimated Closing Date Net Cash Statement
shall be accompanied by (1) relevant backup materials and schedules, in detail
reasonably acceptable to the Parent and (2) copies of all accounting
workpapers relevant to the preparation of the Estimated Closing Date Net Cash
Statement. In the event that Parent contests the Estimated Closing Date Net
Cash Statement, then the parties shall use good faith efforts to resolve the
dispute and if such dispute is not resolved within three (3) days of Parent
giving the Company notice of such dispute, the such dispute shall be settled
by Senior Executives at each of Parent and the Company.

 



 

 **(2) **As soon as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60)
calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to prepare and deliver to the Stockholders Representative a
statement (the " ** _Parent s Closing Date Net Cash Statement_**") that sets

 **(3) **For a period of thirty (30) days after the Surviving Corporation
delivers the Parents Closing Date Net Cash Statement to the Stockholders
Representative, (i) the Stockholders Representative and its advisors or

Net Cash Statement and reasonable access to the personnel of Parent and the

Surviving Corporation to consult as to the procedures and determinations made
by the Surviving Corporation in the Parents Closing Date Net Cash Statement
and (ii) the Stockholders Representative shall have the right to contest the
Parents Closing Date Net Cash Statement by written notice to Parent setting
forth in reasonable detail the Stockholders Representatives objections to
the Parents Closing Date Net Cash Statement and such written notice shall be
accompanied by a statement (the " ** _Stockholders  Representatives Closing
Date Net Cash_** **_Statement_** ") that sets forth the Stockholders
Representatives calculation of the Net Cash as of the Closing Date (the " **
_Stockholders  Representatives Closing Date Net Cash_** _"_ ). In the event
that the Stockholders Representative does not contest the Parents Closing
Date Net Cash Statement within thirty (30) days of receiving the Parents
Closing Date Net Cash Statement, the Parents Closing Date Net Cash Statement
shall be final and binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Stockholders Representative and Closing Date Net Cash shall be the number set
forth in Parents Closing Date Net Cash Statement. In the event that the
Stockholders Representative contests the Parents Closing Date Net Cash
Statement, then the parties shall use good faith efforts to resolve the
dispute within fifteen (15) days of the Stockholders Representatives notice
of contest, but failing such resolution, (i) the Surviving Corporation and the
Stockholders Representative shall engage the New York, New York office of a
nationally-recognized financial accounting firm to be selected by mutual
agreement of Parent and the Stockholders Representative and with whom none of
Parent, Surviving Corporation, Company or any of their respective Affiliates
has had any material personal or professional relationship during the three
year period prior to such selection (the " ** _Price Adjustment Accountant_**
"), and (ii) the Price Adjustment Accountant shall review the Parents Closing
Date Net Cash Statement and the Stockholders Representatives Closing Date
Net Cash Statement, and shall make its own determination of the Net Cash as of
the Closing Date (the " ** _Price Adjustment Accountant s Closing Date Net
Cash_**"), which determination shall be final and binding on Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders Representative. The Price
Adjustment Accountant shall be instructed to provide the Price Adjustment
Accountants Closing Date Net Cash by delivering to Parent and the
Stockholders Representative, within thirty (30) days of the date the Price
Adjustment Accountant was engaged, a statement (the " ** _Price Adjustment
Accountant s Closing Date Net Cash_** **_Statement_** ") that sets forth the
Price Adjustment Accountants Closing Date Net Cash. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " ** _Closing Date Net Cash_** " shall mean either (i) the
Net Cash as set forth on Parents Closing Date Net Cash Statement if not
contested by the Stockholders Representative or (ii) if Parents Closing Date
Net Cash Statement is contested by the Stockholders Representative, the Net
Cash as set forth on the Price Adjustment Accountants Closing Date Net Cash
Statement.

 



 

 **(ii) **If the Closing Date Net Cash is less than the Estimated Closing Date
Net Cash (a " ** _Net Cash Shortfall_** "), then Parent shall be entitled to
receive an amount equal to the Net Cash Shortfall from the Escrow Fund (and,
to the extent the Escrow Fund is insufficient, shall be offset against
Milestone Payments as provided in Section 1.9(e)).

 



 

 **(iii) **If the Closing Date Net Cash is greater than the Estimated Closing
Date Net Cash, (a **" _Net Cash Surplus_** "), then Parent shall (A) cause to

Option) (collectively, the " ** _Option Consideration_** "). At the Effective
Time, each Company Option or portion thereof that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is unvested or
that has a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the sum of
clauses (i) through (iii) of the prior sentence shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive no

holders of such shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted
to such holder or holders pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and Parent shall
pay any consideration required to be paid to such holders of Dissenting
Shares; _provided, however,_ that if such appraisal rights shall not be
perfected or the holders of such shares shall otherwise lose their appraisal
rights with respect to such shares, then, as of the later of the Effective
Time or the time of the failure to perfect such status or the loss of such

to an escrow agreement in a form to be agreed by Company, Parent, the
Stockholders Representative and the Escrow Agent and consistent with this
Agreement (the " ** _Escrow Agreement_** ") and the Administrative Expense
Amount. The Escrow Fund and the Administrative Expense Account: (A) shall be
held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the terms of the Escrow Agreement; (B) shall be held as a trust fund and shall
not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or other judicial
process of any creditor of any Person; and (C) shall be held and disbursed

 **(b) Payment** **Procedures**. Prior to the Closing, Parent and the Company
shall agree on the form of: (A) letter of transmittal; and (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates with respect to each
share of Company Capital Stock and each Company Warrant evidenced by such
Certificate, in exchange for the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration. Promptly (and in any event within one business day) after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate such letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates. Separately, the Company shall provide such
notices as required under the Company Stock Plan and other relevant materials
to holders of Company Options, and may also provide letter of transmittal,
instructions and other relevant materials to holders of record of the
Certificates directly. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to each share of Company Capital
Stock and each Company Warrant evidenced by such Certificate, and any
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Capital Stock or Company Warrant

Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
1.7(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable
Merger Consideration with respect to each share of Company Capital Stock or
Company Warrant evidenced by such Certificate. If a Certificate is properly
surrendered to the Paying Agent not later than two (2) business days prior to
the Closing Date, then Parent shall cause the applicable Merger Consideration
to be paid by the Paying Agent in immediately available funds payable to the
holder of such Certificate at the Closing. If a Certificate is properly
surrendered to the Paying Agent following the Closing, then Parent shall cause
the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid by the Paying Agent in
immediately available funds within two (2) business days after such surrender.

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company, except the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to each share of Company Capital
Stock evidenced by such Certificate upon surrender thereof in accordance with
Section 1.7(a); and (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Capital
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

 **(d) Lost**, **Stolen** **or** **Destroyed** **Certificates**. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay the applicable Merger Consideration to such Person in
exchange for each share of Company Capital Stock evidenced by such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate.

 



 

 **(e) Termination** **of** **Payment** **Fund**. Any portion of the Payment
Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of the Certificates one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand. Any former holders of Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration payable with
respect thereto.

 



 

 **(f) No** **Liability**. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person for any amount delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

 **1.8 Further Action**. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be reasonably
necessary or desirable to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right,
title and possession of and to all rights, privileges, powers, franchises,
assets and property of Merger Sub and the Acquired Corporations, or otherwise
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Acquired Corporations and otherwise) to take
such action.

separately in such country, but the Product component of the Combination
Product is sold separately in such country, Net Sales for the Combination
Product will be calculated by multiplying actual Net Sales of such Combination
Product by the fraction A/C, where A is the invoice price of the Product
component if sold separately, and C is the total weighted (by sales volume)
average invoice price of the Combination Product. If, on a country-by-country
basis, the Product component is not sold separately in such country, Net Sales
for the Combination Product will be D/(D+E), where D is the fair market value
(as determined by Parent in good faith) of the portion of the Combination
Products that contains the Product, and E is the fair market value (as
determined by Parent in good faith) of the portion of the Combination Product
containing the other active ingredient(s), included in such Combination

 **(vi) **It is understood and agreed that if in any calendar year, Net Sales
of the Products achieve more than one of the foregoing Milestone Events set
forth in clauses (iii)  (v) above (i.e., Net Sales grow from **** United

commercially reasonable efforts to implement and conduct all development,

Target Date **,** the sole and exclusive remedy of the Stockholders
Representative and any Company Holder with respect to Parents obligation
pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 1.9(c) shall be that the
provisions set forth in Section 1.9(b)(i) and Section 1.9(b)(ii) shall be
applicable for payment of the Alternative Indication FDA Milestone Payment and
the Alternative Indication EMA Milestone Payment, _provided_ , that such
payments shall be due only to the extent such Milestone Events set forth

Parent shall meet with the Stockholders Representative at Parents offices to
discuss the development status of the Product, provided that Parent shall not

the event Parent does not report to the public on a quarterly basis its sales
of the Product, upon request Parent shall provide to the Stockholders
Representative quarterly reports indicating Net Sales for such quarterly
period, _provided_ , that Stockholders Representative agrees in writing to
keep such information confidential, which writing shall provide that the
Stockholders Representative may share such information with the Escrow

parties are subject to a confidentiality obligation with respect to such
information. If a Technical Failure has occurred, then Parent shall send
written notice thereof to the Stockholders Representative within sixty (60)
calendar days of the date on which Parent and/or its affiliates first cease
engaging in the commercially reasonable efforts otherwise required under
Section 1.9(c) due to such Technical Failure.

Section 1.9 by an amount equal to such Damages or Net Cash Shortfall, as
applicable; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall an amount **** than
**** percent (**** %) of each Milestone Payment be subject to reduction and
setoff pursuant to this Section 1.9(c) to satisfy such Damages or Net Cash
Shortfall.

 



 

 **(f)** ** ****Distribution of Milestone Payments. **Subject to Section 1.5

following each Milestone Payment Date (but in no event later than ten (10)
days immediately following such Milestone Payment Date), Parent shall (i)
cause to be paid to the Bonus Plan Participants a portion of the Milestone
Payment made on such Milestone Payment Date, calculated in accordance with the
terms of the Bonus Plan and in a manner consistent with the methodology set
forth in the final Allocation Schedule delivered by the Company pursuant to
Section 5.2(m), and (ii) pay, or cause to be paid, for distribution as
additional consideration to the holders of Effective Time Shares the remaining
amount of the Milestone Payment, and the Paying Agent or an Acquired
Corporation or the Parent through its payroll, as the case may be, shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to each such holder, subject to the
provisions of Section 1.9, for each Effective Time Share held by such holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a check or wire transfer in an amount

Payment Date divided by the aggregate number of Effective Time Shares. Amounts
payable pursuant to clause "(ii)" of the preceding sentence shall be paid (1)
by an Acquired Corporation or the Parents payroll with respect to Effective
Time Shares subject to Company Options held by employees of the Acquired
Corporations and (2) by the Paying Agent with respect to all other Effective
Time Shares. If any Escrow Participant designates another Person to receive

such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying
Agent the transfer Taxes required by reason of the delivery of such payment to
a Person other than the Escrow Participant, or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

 



 

 **(g)** ** ****Transferability of Milestone Payments.** The right of any
Person to receive any portion of any Milestone Payment shall not be assignable
or transferable except, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws,

distribution to partners or other equity holders of such Person. The Company
hereby acknowledges and agrees, and the Company Holders by virtue of the

Letter of Transmittal shall acknowledge and agree, that: (1) the right to

all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the

Section 4.5: (A) shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the
Effective Time; (B) is intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives; (C) shall

held harmless against any Damages (as defined below) incurred by Parent as a
result of:

 



 

 **(a)** ** **any breach of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement or any breach of the covenants of the
Company or the Acquired Corporations set forth in this Agreement, _provided_ ,
that the Company shall not indemnify Parent Indemnified Parties for Damages
incurred as a result of any actions properly and appropriately taken directly
with respect to the operation of the Current Company Business that were
previously approved in writing and executed by an executive officer of Parent.
For purposes of this Section 7, " ** _Damages_** " shall mean losses, damages,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), obligations, judgments,
liabilities, settlement payments, awards, fines, penalties, Taxes or
deficiencies or other charges, (i) net of any amount of any insurance
proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments and other similar

damages and (ii) excluding any exemplary or punitive damages;

 



 

 **(b)** ** **any action, claim, suit, proceeding instituted, on or at any
time after the Effective Time, by any Company Holder against any officer or

Closing Date by authorizing and approving (i) this Agreement, (ii) the

under this Agreement or in order to obtain the support or approval of Company
Holders for any of such transactions;

 



 

 **(c)** ** **any inaccuracy of the Companys reporting and calculation of the
Closing Date Merger Consideration due to each Company Holder and Bonus Plan
Participant as set forth on the final Allocation Schedule delivered by the
Company pursuant to Section 5.2(m); and

 



 

 **(d)** ** **the matter set forth in Part 2.18 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule; _provided, however_ , that the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to be indemnified and held harmless against only $**** _plus_ ****%
of the Damages in excess of $**** incurred by Parent as a result of this
matter.

 



 

 **7.3** ** ****Limitations on Liability.**

 



 

 **(a)** ** **From and after the Effective Time, the right of Parent
Indemnified Parties to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 7 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any breach of any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in, or any breach by the Company or the
other Acquired Corporations of, **** this Agreement, provided that,
notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the limitations in
Section 7.1 and this Section 7.3 shall not apply in the case of fraud, gross
negligence or intentional misconduct by the Company, any of the Acquired
Corporation or any of their officers, directors, employees or agents. No
current or former stockholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate or
advisor of the Company shall have any personal or individual liability of any
nature to any Parent Indemnified Party with respect to any breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in, or any breach by the Company of this
Agreement. Should the Closing occur, recourse by Parent Indemnified Parties to
the Escrow Fund and an offset against up to 10% of any unpaid Milestone
Payments (pursuant to Section 1.9(c) of this Agreement) shall be Parent
Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive remedy for any Damages resulting from
the matters referred to in Section 7.2 or resulting from any breach of this
Agreement by the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, in no event will any Parent Indemnified Party have any recourse to
recover directly from any Escrow Participant any Damages resulting from the
matters referred to in Section 7.2 or from any breach of this Agreement by the
Company from any Merger Consideration that has been paid to such Escrow
Participant, except in the event of fraud by such Escrow Participant.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **Without limiting the effect of any other limitation set forth in
this Section 7, the indemnification provided for in Section 7.2(a) with
respect to any breach of the representations and warranties of the Company
shall not apply, and Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
exercise any indemnification rights under this Agreement for any such breach,
except to the extent that the aggregate amount of all claims for Damages
against which Parent Indemnified Parties would otherwise be entitled to be
indemnified under Section 7.2 exceeds Two Million Two Hundred and Twenty-Five
Thousand United States Dollars ($2,250,000) (the " ** _Deductible_** "). If
the aggregate amount of all claims for Damages exceeds the Deductible, then
Parent shall, subject to the other limitations set forth in this Agreement, be
entitled to be indemnified only against the portion of such Damages in excess
of the Deductible.

 **(c)** ** **The amount of any Damages that are subject to indemnification
under this Section 7 shall be calculated net of the amount of any insurance
proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements
received or receivable by Parent Indemnified Parties in connection with such
Damages or any of the events or circumstances giving rise or otherwise related
to such Damages. The Parent Indemnified Parties shall seek, and shall cause
each of their respective affiliates to seek, full recovery under all insurance
policies covering any Damages to the same extent as they would if such Damages
were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance
recovery is made by Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to any Damages for
which any Parent Indemnified Party has been indemnified hereunder, then a
refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be deposited
promptly with the Paying Agent for distribution to the Escrow Participants.
The amount of any Damages that are subject to indemnification under this
Section 7 shall be calculated net of any Tax benefit received or receivable by
a Parent Indemnified Party in connection with such Damages or any of the
events or circumstances giving rise or otherwise related to such Damages.

 



 

 **7.4** ** ****Defense of Third Party Claims**. Promptly after Parent
Indemnified Party, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation receives notice or otherwise obtains Knowledge of any
actual or possible claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation,
inquiry or proceeding that has been or may be brought or asserted by a third
party against a Parent Indemnified Party and that may give rise to an
indemnification claim by Parent Indemnified Party under this Section 7 (any
such actual or possible claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration,
investigation, inquiry or proceeding by a third party being referred to as a "
** _Third-Party Claim_** "), Parent, or the Parent Indemnified Party, shall
deliver to the Stockholders Representative a written notice stating in
reasonable detail the nature and basis of such Third-Party Claim and the
dollar amount of such Third-Party Claim, to the extent known. The timely
delivery of such written notice by Parent, or the Parent Indemnified Party, to
the Stockholders Representative shall not limit the Parent Indemnified
Partys right to be indemnified under this Section 7 with respect to such
Third-Party Claim or any of the facts or circumstances giving rise to such
Third-Party Claim, except to the extent the Stockholders Representative or
the Escrow Participants are materially prejudiced by the failure of such
timely delivery. The Stockholders Representative shall have the right, at the
Stockholders Representatives option, at any time to assume the defense of
any such Third-Party Claim for which the Parent Indemnified Party may be
indemnified hereunder with its own counsel. If the Stockholders
Representative elects to assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim,
then:

 



 

 **(a)** ** **the attorneys fees of the Stockholders Representatives
counsel and other defense costs incurred by the Stockholders Representative
shall be payable by the Escrow Participants without the requirement of any
consent or approval by Parent or any other Person;

 



 

 **(b)** ** **notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, a Parent Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to be indemnified
for any costs or expenses incurred by the Parent Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim following the
Stockholders Representatives election to assume the defense of such Third-
Party Claim;

 **(c)** ** **the Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to monitor (but
not control) such defense at its own expense;

 



 

 **(d)** ** **the Parent shall make available (including by electronic means,
to the extent available) to the Stockholders Representative all books,
records and other documents and materials that are under the direct or
indirect control of Parent or any of Parents Subsidiaries or other affiliates
and that the Stockholders Representative considers reasonably necessary or
desirable for the defense of such Third-Party Claim;

 



 

 **(e)** ** **the Parent Indemnified Party shall execute such documents and
take such other actions as the Stockholders Representative may reasonably
request for the purpose of facilitating the defense of, or any settlement,
compromise or adjustment relating to, such Third-Party Claim;

 



 

 **(f)** ** **the Parent Indemnified Party shall otherwise cooperate as
reasonably requested by the Stockholders Representative in the defense of
such Third-Party Claim;

 



 

 **(g)** ** **the Parent Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with
respect to such Third-Party Claim; and

 



 

 **(h)** ** **the Stockholders Representative shall not enter into any
settlement agreement providing for the settlement of such Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if such settlement agreement
imposes on any Parent Indemnified Party any obligation.

 



 

If the Stockholders Representative elects not to assume the defense of such
Third-Party Claim, then Parent, or Parent Indemnified Party, shall proceed to
defend such Third-Party Claim with the assistance of counsel satisfactory to
the Stockholders Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent
nor the Parent Indemnified Party shall settle, adjust or compromise such
Third-Party Claim, or admit any liability with respect to such Third-Party
Claim, without the prior written consent of the Stockholders Representative.
In such event, the Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to monitor
(but not control) such defense at the expense of the Escrow Participants.

 



 

 **7.5** ** ****Subrogation; Mitigation.**

 



 

 **(a)** ** **To the extent that a Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7, the Stockholders Representative
shall be entitled to exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any rights and
remedies (including rights of indemnity, rights of contribution and other
rights of recovery) that the Parent Indemnified Party may have against any
other Person with respect to any Damages, circumstances or matter to which
such indemnification is directly or indirectly related. The Parent Indemnified
Party shall permit the Stockholders Representative to use the name of the
Parent Indemnified Party and its affiliates in any transaction or in any
proceeding or other matter involving any of such rights or remedies, and the
Parent Indemnified Party shall take such actions as the Stockholders
Representative may

reasonably request for the purpose of enabling the Stockholders
Representative to perfect or exercise the right of subrogation of the
Stockholders Representative under this Section 7.5(a).

 



 

 **(b)** ** **Promptly after Parent or the Surviving Corporation becomes aware
of any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to constitute
or give rise to any breach of any representation or warranty set forth in
Section 2 or of any covenants of the Company set forth in Section 4.1 of this
Agreement, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall take all reasonable
steps to mitigate and minimize all Damages that may result from such breach.

 



 

 **7.6** ** ****Indemnification Claims.**

 



 

 **(a)** ** **No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
under this Section 7 unless he, she or it has duly delivered a written notice
to the Stockholders Representative (any such notice being referred to as a "
** _Notice of Indemnification Claim_** ," and the claim for indemnification
described in such Notice of Indemnification Claim being referred to as an " **
_Indemnification Claim_** "), setting forth: (i) the specific representation
and warranty or covenant alleged to have been breached by the Company; (ii) a
reasonable description of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the
alleged breach of such representation and warranty or covenant; and (iii) an
estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of the Damages that have been incurred
or will be incurred by the Parent Indemnified Party as a result of the breach
referred to in such notice (the aggregate amount of such estimate being
referred to as the " ** _Claimed Amount_** ").

 



 

 **(b)** ** **During the 60-day period commencing upon the receipt by the
Stockholders Representative of a Notice of Indemnification Claim, the
Stockholders Representative may deliver to Parent a written response (the "
** _Response Notice_** ") in which the Stockholders Representative: (i)
agrees that the full Claimed Amount is owed to Parent Indemnified Party; (ii)
agrees that part (but not all) of the Claimed Amount (the " ** _Agreed
Amount_** ") is owed to Parent Indemnified Party; or (iii) asserts that no
part of the Claimed Amount is owed to Parent Indemnified Party. Any part of
the Claimed Amount that is not agreed by the Stockholders Representative to
be owed to the Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to the Response Notice (or
the entire Claimed Amount, if the Stockholders Representative asserts in the
Response Notice that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to Parent
Indemnified Party) shall be referred to as the " ** _Contested Amount_**." If
no Response Notice is delivered during such 60-day period, then, for purposes
of this Agreement, the Stockholders Representative shall be deemed to have
delivered to Parent a Response Notice on the last day of such 60-day period
asserting that the full amount of the Claimed Amount is owed to Parent
Indemnified Party.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **If the Stockholders Representative delivers a Response Notice
to Parent agreeing that the full Claimed Amount is owed to Parent Indemnified
Party, then, subject to Section 7.3, Parent Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to receive the Claimed Amount from the Escrow Fund or by offset
against a Milestone Payment in accordance with Sections 1.9 and 7.3.

 



 

 **(d)** ** **If the Stockholders Representative delivers a Response Notice
to Parent agreeing that less than the full Claimed Amount is owed to Parent
Indemnified Party, then, subject to Section 7.3, Parent Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to receive the Agreed Amount

from the Escrow Fund or by offset against a Milestone Payment in accordance
with Sections 1.9 and 7.3 and the remainder of the Claimed Amount will
continue to be a Contested Amount.

 



 

 **(e)** ** **If the Stockholders Representative delivers a Response Notice
to Parent indicating that there is a Contested Amount, the Stockholders
Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute
related to the Contested Amount. If Parent and the Stockholders
Representative resolve such dispute in writing, then a settlement agreement
stipulating the amount owed to Parent (the " ** _Stipulated Amount_** ") shall
be signed by Parent and the Stockholders Representative and then, subject to
Section 7.3, Parent shall be entitled to receive the Stipulated Amount from
the Escrow Fund or by offset against a Milestone Payment in accordance with
Sections 1.9 and 7.3.

 



 

 **(f)** ** **If the Stockholders Representative and Parent are unable to
resolve the dispute relating to any Contested Amount during the 30-day period
commencing upon the receipt of the Response Notice by Parent, then either
Parent or the Stockholders Representative may proceed in accordance with
Section 8.6. The final decision following resolution of the dispute in
accordance with Section 8.6 shall include the dollar amount of the award to
Parent, if any (the " ** _Award Amount_** "), and shall be furnished to the
Stockholders Representative and Parent in writing and then, subject to
Section 7.3, Parent shall be entitled to receive the Award Amount from the
Escrow Fund or by offset against a Milestone Payment in accordance with
Sections 1.9 and 7.3.

 



 

 **(g)** ** **The parties agree that any amounts received from the Escrow Fund
or by offset against the Milestone Payments pursuant to this Section 7 shall
be treated as a reduction in the aggregate consideration paid in connection
with the Merger for federal income Tax purposes.

 



 

 **(h)** ** **Subject to any applicable limitations set forth in this
Agreement, for the avoidance of doubt, in the event the Parent Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7, the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall recover first from the Escrow Fund, until such
Escrow Fund has a zero balance, and thereafter shall have the right to setoff
against the Milestone Payments in accordance with Sections 1.9(e) and 7.3.

 



 

 **7.7** ** ****Release of Escrow Funds.**

 



 

 **(a)** ** **On December 15, 2011 (the " ** _Initial Escrow Release Date_**
"), the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Escrow Participants an aggregate
amount equal to Fifteen Million United States Dollars (US$15,000,000) _minus_
(i) any amount previously released from the Escrow Fund _minus_ (ii) any
amount that is necessary to satisfy all then unresolved, unsatisfied or
disputed Indemnification Claims specified in a properly delivered Notice of
Indemnification Claim delivered to the Stockholders Representative before the
Initial Escrow Release Date. If any Indemnification Claims are unresolved,
unsatisfied or disputed as of the Initial Escrow Release Date, then the Escrow
Agent shall retain possession and custody of that portion of the Escrow Amount
that equals the total maximum amount of Damages being claimed by Parent in all
such unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed Indemnification Claims (the " **
_Pending Claim Amount_** "). If any such Indemnification Claims are resolved
between the Initial Escrow Release Date and the Remaining Escrow Release Date,
then as soon as such Indemnification Claim has

been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Escrow Participants from
the Escrow Fund any portion of the Pending Claim Amount not delivered to the
Parent Indemnified Parties and not required to satisfy any other pending
Indemnification Claims; _provided_ that the Escrow Agent shall not be required
to deliver such amounts to the Escrow Participants prior to the Remaining
Escrow Release Date (as defined below) until such time as the total amount to
be delivered to the Escrow Participants in the aggregate exceeds $500,000.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **On the date that is eighteen (18) months immediately after the
Effective Time (the " ** _Remaining_** **_Escrow Release Date_** "), the
Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Escrow Participants all of the remaining
amounts in the Escrow Fund (if any) in excess of any amount that is necessary
to satisfy all unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed Indemnification Claims
specified in a properly delivered Notice of Indemnification Claim delivered to
the Stockholders Representative before the Remaining Escrow Release Date. If
any Indemnification Claims are unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed as of the
Remaining Escrow Release Date, then the Escrow Agent shall retain possession
and custody of that portion of the Escrow Amount that equal the total maximum
amount of Damages being claimed by Parent in all such unresolved, unsatisfied
or disputed Indemnification Claims, and as soon as all such Indemnification
Claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Escrow
Participants all of the remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund (if any) not
required to satisfy such Indemnification Claims.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **All amounts delivered to the Escrow Participants from the Escrow
Fund pursuant to Sections 7.7(a) and (b) shall be distributed to such Escrow
Participants in accordance with the final Allocation Schedule delivered by the
Company pursuant to Section 5.2(m).

 



 

 **7.8** ** ****Exercise of Remedies Other Than by Parent**. No Parent
Indemnified Party (other than Parent or any successor thereto or assign
thereof) shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise
any other remedy under this Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto
or assign thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such
indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.

 



 

 **SECTION 8.** ** ****MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS**

 



 

 **8.1** ** ****Stockholders  Representative.**

 



 

 **(a)** ** **By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the
principal terms of the Merger, the consummation of the Merger or participating
in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, including the right to
receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger, and/or the
cancellation by an Escrow Participant of Company Options or Company Warrants
in exchange for Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement and/or
participation in the Bonus Plan, the Escrow Participants irrevocably nominate,
constitute and appoint Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the agent
and true and lawful attorney in fact of the Escrow Participants (the " **
_Stockholders  Representative_**") to take any and all actions and make any
and all decisions required or permitted to be taken or made by the
Stockholders Representative under this Agreement or another agreement entered
into prior to the Closing by the Stockholders Representative and certain
Escrow Participants in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the exercise of the right to:

(i) give and receive notices and communications under Sections 1 and 7; (ii)
authorize payments from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement or offset against Milestone Payments in satisfaction of claims for
indemnification made by Parent under Section 7; (iii) authorize payments from
the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement pursuant to a
Net Cash Adjustment under Section 1.3(e); (iv) object to claims for
indemnification made by Parent under Section 7 or to Parents calculation of
Net Cash under Section 1.3(e); (v) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements
and compromises of and comply with any arbitration awards or court orders with
respect to claims for indemnification made by Parent under Section 7 or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement; (vi) administer the Bonus Plan as
"Representative" (as defined in the Bonus Plan) thereunder and in accordance
with the terms thereof; and (vii) take all actions necessary or appropriate in
the good faith judgment of the Stockholders Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. The identity of the Stockholders
Representative may be changed, and a successor Stockholders Representative
may be appointed, from time to time (including in the event of the resignation
or the death, disability or other incapacity of the Stockholders
Representative) by the Escrow Participants holding a majority of the Effective
Time Shares, and any such successor shall succeed the Stockholders
Representative as Stockholders Representative hereunder. If for any reason
there is no Stockholders Representative at any time, all references herein to
the Stockholders Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Escrow
Participants holding a majority of the Effective Time Shares. No bond shall be
required of the Stockholders Representative. From and after the Effective
Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders
Representative shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each Escrow
Participant. Each Escrow Participant hereby agrees to receive correspondence
from the Stockholders Representative, including in electronic form.

 



 

The Stockholders Representative shall not be liable for any liability, loss,
damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred without gross negligence or
willful misconduct by the Stockholders Representative while acting in good
faith and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of its duties or the exercise of his rights hereunder (it being
understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel
shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith). The Escrow Participants
shall indemnify, defend and hold the Stockholders Representative harmless
against any liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense
(collectively, the " ** _Representative Losses_** ") incurred or suffered by
the Stockholders Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of his duties under this Agreement, in each case
as such Representative Loss is incurred or suffered; provided that in the
event it is finally adjudicated that a Representative Loss or any portion
thereof was primarily caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Stockholders Representative, the Stockholders Representative will
reimburse the Escrow Participants the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss attributable to such gross negligence or willful
misconduct. If not paid directly to the Stockholders Representative by the
Escrow Participants any such Representative Loss incurred or suffered without
gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Stockholders Representative may
be recovered by the Stockholders Representative from: (A) the funds in the
Administrative Expense Amount; (B) the amounts in the Escrow Fund otherwise
distributable to Escrow Participants pursuant to the terms hereof and the
Escrow Agreement at the time of distribution in accordance with written
instructions

delivered by the Stockholders Representative to the Escrow Agent, and (C) by
offset against any Milestone Payments actually payable to the Escrow
Participants pursuant to written instructions delivered by the Stockholders
Representative to Parent; provided that while this section allows the
Stockholders Representative to be paid from the Administrative Expense
Amount, the Escrow Fund and by offset against the Milestone Payments, this
does not relieve the Escrow Participants from their obligation to promptly pay
such Representative Losses as such Representative Losses are suffered or
incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholders Representative from seeking
any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Escrow Participants shall not indemnify the Stockholders Representative
for any Representative Losses arising out of the Stockholders
Representatives willful misconduct or gross negligence. In furtherance of the
payment of such losses and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the
Stockholders Representative, at the Closing, Parent will deliver a sum of
Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars **(** US$500,000) (the " **
_Administrative Expense Amount_** ") to an account of the Escrow Agent
established in the name of the Stockholders Representative (the " **
_Administrative Expense Account_** "). Of the Administrative Expense Amount,
(i) for each Effective Time Share outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, an amount equal to the Residual Administrative Expense Amount
divided by aggregate number of Effective Time Shares shall be deemed to be a
contribution to the Administrative Expense Account with respect to each such
Effective Time Share, and (ii) for each Bonus Plan Participant, an amount
equal to such Bonus Plan Participants allocable portion of the Bonus Plan
Administrative Expense Amount shall be deemed to be a contribution to the
Administrative Expense Account, as provided by the final Allocation Schedule
delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 5.2(m). The Escrow Participants
agree that, to the extent available, the Stockholders Representative shall be
entitled to draw against the Administrative Expense Account at any time and
from time to time as and when (i) the Stockholders Representative incurs any
losses and expenses indemnified by the Escrow Participants as set forth in
this Agreement, (ii) as and when any losses and expenses are otherwise due
under this Agreement and (iii) necessary or appropriate to pay any costs and
expenses reasonably incurred by the Stockholders Representative in the
performance of his duties in accordance with this Agreement. The Stockholders
Representative shall be the administrator of the Administrative Expense
Account and shall have sole and absolute authority over the Administrative
Expense Account to pay all losses and expenses incurred in accordance with
this Agreement. Upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Stockholders
Representative no longer having any duties to perform under this Agreement, or
(ii) at the discretion of the Stockholders Representative, all amounts
remaining in the Administrative Expense Account shall be distributed by the
Paying Agent to the Escrow Participants in accordance with the final
Allocation Schedule delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 5.2(m).

 



 

 **(b)** ** **From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide the Stockholders Representative with
reasonable access to information about the Surviving Corporation (including
electronically) and the reasonable assistance of the officers and employees of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation for purposes of performing its duties and
exercising its rights under this Agreement, including Sections 1 and 7.

 **(c)** ** **On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company or Parent shall
provide the Stockholders Representative with copies of the following: (i) the
form of the letter of transmittal described in Section 1.7(b); (ii) the paying
agent agreement between Parent and the Paying Agent in connection with, among
other things, the Paying Agents duties pursuant to Section 1.7; and (iii) the
Estimated Closing Date Net Cash Statement.

 



 

 **8.2** ** ****Expenses**. Except as otherwise provided herein, each party
shall pay all of its own fees, costs and expenses (including fees, costs and
expenses of legal counsel, investment bankers, brokers or other
representatives and consultants and appraisal fees, costs and expenses)
incurred in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the other agreements contemplated by this Agreement, the
performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

 **8.3** ** ****Exclusive Representations and Warranties**. Parent
acknowledges that, except as expressly provided in Section 2, Parent is not
relying and has not relied on any representations or warranties whatsoever
