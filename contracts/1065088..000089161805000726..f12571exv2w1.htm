    <TD>At Completion, each Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
Completion, whether or not vested, shall be converted into and become an option to purchase
Purchaser Shares as provided below in this sub-clause 2.3, and the Purchaser shall assume such
Option in accordance with this sub-clause 2.3 and the terms (as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement) of the Share Option Plan and/or the share option
agreement by which such Option is evidenced; <I>provided, however</I>, that if the consent of the
holder of any Option is required in connection with the actions contemplated by this
sub-clause 2.3, then the Option shall not be converted as described in this sub-clause 2.3
until such consent is obtained. All rights to purchase Ordinary Shares under Options
converted as contemplated by this paragraph (&#147;<B>Assumed Options</B>&#148;) shall, effective as of
Completion, thereupon be converted into rights to purchase Purchaser Shares. Accordingly,
from and after Completion: (i)&nbsp;each Assumed Option may be exercised solely for Purchaser
Shares; (ii)&nbsp;the number of Purchaser Shares subject to each Assumed Option shall be
determined by multiplying the number of Ordinary Shares that were subject to such Assumed
Option immediately prior to Completion by the Conversion Ratio (as defined below), and
rounding the resulting number up to the nearest whole number of Purchaser Shares; (iii)&nbsp;the
per share exercise price for the Purchaser Shares issuable upon exercise of each Assumed
Option shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Ordinary Shares
subject to such Option, as in effect immediately prior to Completion, by the Conversion
Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and (iv)&nbsp;any
restriction on the exercise of any Assumed Option shall continue in full force and effect
and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Assumed Option
shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the conversion of such Assumed Option;
<I>provided, however, </I>that: (A)&nbsp;each Assumed Option shall, in accordance with its terms, be
subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, issuance of bonus shares, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction
with respect to Purchaser Shares subsequent to Completion; and (B)&nbsp;the Purchaser&#146;s board of
directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Company&#146;s board of directors or any committee thereof with respect to each Assumed Option.
For the purpose of this sub-clause 2.3, the &#147;<B>Conversion Ratio</B>&#148; shall mean the number
determined by dividing: (i) <FONT face="'Times New Roman',times,serif">&#128;</FONT>2,500,000,000; <I>by </I>(ii)&nbsp;the product of: (A)&nbsp;the Aggregate

extent appropriate to reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, issuance of bonus shares, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to Purchaser
Shares). The Purchaser shall file with the SEC, no later than 15&nbsp;days after Completion, a
