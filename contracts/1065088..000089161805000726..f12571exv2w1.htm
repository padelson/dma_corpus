resulting number up to the nearest whole number of Purchaser Shares; (iii)
the per share exercise price for the Purchaser Shares issuable upon exercise
of each Assumed Option shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise
price of Ordinary Shares subject to such Option, as in effect immediately
prior to Completion, by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting
exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and (iv) any restriction on the
exercise of any Assumed Option shall continue in full force and effect and
the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such
Assumed Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the conversion
of such Assumed Option;  _provided, however,_ that: (A) each Assumed Option

appropriate to reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares,
stock dividend, issuance of bonus shares, reverse stock split, consolidation
of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction with respect to Purchaser Shares subsequent to Completion; and
(B) the Purchasers board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed
to the authority and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or
any committee thereof with respect to each Assumed Option. For the purpose of
this sub-clause 2.3, the "Conversion Ratio" shall mean the number determined
by dividing: (i) 2,500,000,000; _by_ (ii) the product of: (A) the
Aggregate Outstanding Share Number; and (B) the Completion Purchaser Share
Price (adjusted to the extent appropriate to reflect any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, issuance of bonus shares,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to
Purchaser Shares). The Purchaser shall file with the SEC, no later than 15

form), if available for use by the Purchaser, relating to the Purchaser
Shares issuable with respect to the Assumed Options.

such Warrantholder between the date of this Agreement and the Completion Date
upon exercise of any Warrants held by it shall constitute Sale Shares and
shall be sold by the relevant Warrantholder to the Purchaser at Completion in
accordance with sub-clause 2.1.

Consideration B Election Per Share Upfront Cash Amount or the Earn Out
Election Per Share Upfront Cash Amount, as applicable, payable to such
Warrantholder in respect of such Ordinary Share in accordance with sub-clause

prior to Completion) in accordance with their respective entitlements. A
share certificate evidencing the aggregate number of Purchaser Shares to be
issued pursuant to sub-clauses 4.2(a)(ii), 4.2(b)(ii) and 4.2(c)(ii) shall be
delivered to the Sellers Representative at the address set forth in Clause

stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization
or other similar transaction, or by any other reason, or if a stock dividend
is declared by the Company or the Purchaser during such period, or a record

this Agreement, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares

fraction of a Purchaser Share (after aggregating all fractional Purchaser
Shares issuable to such Seller) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share,
be paid in cash the amount in Euro (rounded up to the nearest whole Euro
cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the

however,_ that (a) each Seller may hedge any of such Sellers
Fixed Consideration Lock-Up Shares provided that all such hedging activity is
in full compliance with all

       |   | applicable Laws, and (b) the restrictions imposed on each
Seller under this sentence shall expire with respect to one third of the
Fixed Consideration Lock-Up Shares received by such Seller on each of the
180th, 360th and 540th day following the Completion Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, subject to compliance with all applicable securities and other
Laws, any Seller that is a venture capital or similar fund may transfer any
Purchaser Shares received pursuant to this Agreement to any other venture
capital or similar fund that is both an Affiliate of the transferor venture
capital or similar fund and is also a Seller (it being understood that: (a)
the transferee on transfer shall be bound by all of the terms of this
Agreement as if such transferee received such Purchaser Shares at Completion;
and (b) any attempted transfer in violation of this sentence shall be null
and void). Each Seller who has made the Earn Out Election hereby agrees that,
during the two-year period following Completion, such Seller shall not,
directly or indirectly offer, sell, offer to sell, agree to sell, pledge,
assign, encumber, grant any option to purchase, transfer, dispose of, enter

set forth in this sentence being referred to as the "Earn Out Lock-Up Shares"
and, together with the Fixed Consideration Lock-Up Shares, the "Lock-Up
Shares")); _provided, however,_ that the restrictions imposed on each Seller
under this sentence shall expire with respect to 25% of the Earn Out Lock-
Up Shares received by such Seller on each of the 180th, 360th, 540th and
720th day following the Completion Date. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees
that: (a) stop transfer instructions will be given to the
Purchasers transfer agent with respect to the Lock-Up Shares, and (b) each
certificate representing any Lock-Up Shares shall bear a legend identical or
similar in effect to the following legend (together with any other legend or
legends required by applicable state securities Laws or otherwise):

OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT DATED SEPTEMBER 11, 2005, BETWEEN THE

Bank: (i) a stock certificate registered in the name of the Bank (or its
nominee) evidencing the aggregate number of Escrow Shares to be deposited

Completion Escrow Share register. Each Seller shall be entitled to exercise
all voting rights with respect to the Escrow Shares deposited into the Escrow
Account on such Sellers behalf, by instructing the Bank how such Seller

a merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, reorganization or
liquidation involving the Purchaser, or otherwise, shall be held by the
Escrow Agent as, and shall be included within the definition of, Escrow
Shares. Ordinary cash dividends payable in respect of the Escrow Shares will
be paid by the Purchaser directly to the Receiving Bank Account on behalf of
the relevant Sellers and not to the Bank and payment of such cash dividends
to the Receiving Bank Account on behalf of the relevant Sellers shall
constitute good discharge to the Purchaser in respect of them. The Sellers
Representative shall procure that such cash dividends are thereafter paid to

limiting their respective rights under this Agreement); or

End Date, terminate this Agreement by notice in writing to the Purchaser, in
the case of notice by the Sellers Representative, or to the Sellers
Representative and the Company, in the case of notice by the Purchaser,

attributable to any act or omission by the Purchaser, in the case of notice
by the Purchaser, or by any Seller, in the case of notice by the
Sellers Representative.  
   

  

     8.5  |   | If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with

     9.5  |   | Each of the Sellers agrees and undertakes to the
Purchaser (for the Purchaser itself and as agent for each individual and
entity referred to in this sub-clause 9.6) that it has no rights against and
hereby waives and shall not make any claim against any of the Group Companies
or, except in the case of fraud, dishonesty or wilful default, any present or
former employee, director, agent or officer of any of the Group Companies on
whom it may have relied before agreeing to any term of or before entering
into this Agreement, including in relation to any information supplied or
omitted to be supplied by any such person in connection with the Warranties
or this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
      
  9.6  |   | The Warranties shall be deemed to be repeated immediately
before Completion by reference to the facts and circumstances then existing

references to the date of Completion, except to the extent that any Warranty
speaks as of another date in which case such Warranty shall refer to
such other date.  
      
  9.7  |   | Each of the Sellers agrees and undertakes to notify promptly
to the Purchaser in writing if it, after the date of this Agreement, becomes
actually aware of any circumstance which would cause or, in the reasonable
opinion of the Sellers, be reasonably likely to cause any Warranty (if the
Warranties were repeated with reference to the facts and circumstances then
existing, except to the extent that any Warranty speaks as of another date in
which case such Warranty shall refer to such other date) to become untrue or
inaccurate or misleading in any respect which is material to the Business or
to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
      
  9.8  |   | The Purchaser hereby warrants to the Sellers in the terms of
the Purchaser Warranties at the date of this Agreement. The Purchaser
Warranties shall be deemed to be repeated immediately before Completion by
reference to the facts and circumstances then existing as if references in
the Purchaser Warranties to the date of this Agreement were references to the
date of Completion, except to the extent that any Purchaser Warranty speaks
as of another date in which case such Purchaser Warranty shall refer to such
other date (it being understood that, for the purposes of the Conditions to
Completion contained in Schedule 2, all "material adverse effect"
qualifications and other materiality qualifications contained in the
Purchaser Warranties shall be disregarded).  
      
  9.9  |   | No fact, matter or circumstance of which the Purchaser has
knowledge as of the date of this Agreement or had knowledge at any time prior
to Completion (other than any fact, matter or circumstance fairly disclosed
in this Agreement, the Disclosure Letter or any of the Data Room Documents
(as defined in the Disclosure Letter) shall have the effect of limiting
or restricting any liability of the Sellers (or any rights of the Purchaser)
with respect to any Relevant Claim, or any liability arising as a result of
any fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or dishonesty, provided that, solely
for the purposes of determining whether or not the condition to Completion
set forth in paragraph 2 of Schedule 2 has been satisfied, no fact, matter or
circumstance of which the Purchaser has actual knowledge as of the date
of this Agreement shall form the basis of an assertion that any Warranty is
untrue when repeated immediately prior to Completion or, to the extent that
any Warranty speaks of another date, as of such other date.

     10.  |   | Effect of Completion

  11.  |   | Conduct of Proceedings  
      
    |   | The provisions of Schedule 10 shall apply to any Third Party

undertaking of the Purchaser.

     12.2  |   | Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, the single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy
provided by Law or under this Agreement shall not preclude any other or
further exercise of it or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

  12.3  |   | Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
the rights, powers and remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative and

assign, all or any part of the benefit of, or its rights or benefits under,
this Agreement or any causes of action arising hereunder without the prior
written consent of the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, other than an assignment by
operation of Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser may, without
the consent of the Sellers Representative, assign to an Affiliate of the
Purchaser the benefit of all or any of the Sellers obligations under this
Agreement and/or any other benefit to the Purchaser arising under or out of
this Agreement provided always that: (i) the liability of any Seller is in
no way increased as a result of or following such assignment and (ii) prior
to any such assignee ceasing to be an Affiliate of the Purchaser, the
Purchaser shall procure that such assignee shall assign to the Purchaser or
another Affiliate of the Purchaser the benefit of any of the Sellers
obligations under this Agreement and/or any other benefit to the Purchaser
arising under or out of this Agreement that had previously been assigned to
such assignee.  
      
  13.2  |   | Immediately after any assignment or reassignment in
accordance with the second sentence of sub-Clause 13.1, the Purchaser shall
give written notice thereof to the Sellers Representative.  
      
  13.3  |   | Subject to sub-Clause 13.1, this Agreement will be binding
upon, enure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors in title and permitted assigns.

documents as the Purchaser may reasonably consider necessary to implement and

Representative, as the case may be, can demonstrate that disclosure of the

Confidential Material has been disclosed in accordance with this sub-clause

account the reasonable comments or requests of such other party.

by virtue of such statute, the parties to this Agreement may agree to vary or

terminate, or any Seller, in the case of the Sellers Representative seeking
so to terminate).  
   

  

     22.2  |   | If this Agreement terminates in accordance with sub-

or breaches of Warranty or other relevant provision of this Agreement
provided however that the Purchaser shall not be deemed to have waived any of
such claims if:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | the Purchaser has delivered written notice to the
Sellers Representative specifying in reasonable detail (with supporting
evidence), the event, matter or breach which gives rise to the relevant

  24.  |   | Severability

Accounts Relief; (ii) the amount of Tax which has been saved in consequence
of the use or set off of the Purchasers Relief in the case of the use or set

     2.  |   | The Sellers Obligations  
---|---|--- 
   

 

Subject to paragraph 3, the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser by way of

       | (i)  |   | as a result of an Event occurring on or
before Completion; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | in respect of any income, profits or gains which were
earned, accrued or received on or before Completion or in respect of a period
ending on or before Completion;  
   

   

in each case whether or not the Tax is chargeable against or attributable to
another person and whether or not any amount in respect thereof is
recoverable from any other person; 

   

(b) which is primarily the liability of another person (the Primary Person)
for which a Group Company is liable in consequence of:

Liability; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | a Group Company at any time before Completion:  
   

   

(A) being a member of the same group of companies as the Primary Person; or 

   

(B) having control of, being controlled by, or being otherwise connected
with, the Primary Person or being controlled by the same person as the

   ##### 

  

   

Group Company in connection with any such Tax Liability (or claim for such
Tax Liability) or in taking or defending any action under this Schedule. 

   

(d) The Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to any depletion in
the assets, or increase in the liabilities, of the Purchaser or the Group
Company as a result of any inheritance tax which: 

  

       | (i)  |   | is at Completion a charge on any of the Shares or
assets of the Group Company or gives rise to a power to sell, mortgage or
charge any of the Shares or assets of the Group Company; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | after Completion becomes a charge on or gives rise to

of the death of any person (whenever occurring) within seven years after a
transfer of value or deemed transfer of value where such transfer of value or
deemed transfer of value occurred on or before Completion.  
   

   

For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of this paragraph 2(d) the assets
of the Purchaser or a Group Company are deemed to be depleted by such amount
as it is necessary to pay in order to discharge or remove any charge on, or
power to sell, mortgage or charge, any of the Shares or the assets of a Group
Company and notwithstanding any provision in this Schedule the Purchaser or
the Group Company may disregard any right to pay tax in instalments in
discharging or removing a charge or power.

  3.1  |   | The covenant in paragraph 2 does not apply in respect of any

Tax Liability was made or reflected in the Accounts (including any provision
or reserve made in respect of deferred Tax) in the Accounts;

       | (c)  |   | any Taxes arising in connection with the

    | (d)  |   | payment or discharge of such Tax Liability was shown in
the Accounts;  
      
    | (e)  |   | the Tax Liability arises as a result of a change on or

other than a change which is necessary in order to comply with the law or
generally accepted accounting principles applicable to any Group Company as
at Completion;  
      
    | (f)  |   | the Tax Liability arises as a result of any default or
delay by the Purchaser or any Group Company after Completion, including
(without limitation) a delay in paying or satisfying any Tax Liability or a
delay or default in submitting any returns, computations or other documents
required to be submitted by them or in submitting such returns, computations
or documents outside the appropriate time limits or in submitting such
returns, computations or documents otherwise than on a proper basis, in each
case after Completion (other than as a result of the Sellers failing to
comply with their obligations under Paragraph 7 hereof);  
      
    | (g)  |   | such Tax Liability arises or is increased as a result
of:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | a change in Tax rates or in legislation law,
directive or requirement made after Completion; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | a change or withdrawal after Completion of any
previously published practice or concession of any Tax Authority;  
   

   

in each case with retrospective effect provided that this paragraph 3.1(f)
shall not apply in the case of any Tax Liability falling within paragraph
2(b); 

  

       | (h)  |   | such Tax Liability would not have arisen but for
an omission or a voluntary act or transaction carried out by the Purchaser or
a Group Company after Completion otherwise than:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | in fulfilment of a legally binding commitment
entered into by a Group Company on or before Completion; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | in order to comply with the law applicable to the
Group Company or the Purchaser at Completion; or  
      
    | (iii)  |   | in the ordinary course of business of a Group Company
as such business was conducted at Completion; or  
      
    | (iv)  |   | pursuant to a written request by the Sellers
Representative; or  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (v)  |   | in circumstances where the Purchaser did not know
and could not reasonably have been expected to know that it would give rise
to the Tax Liability in question;  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   

PROVIDED THAT the following shall not (without limitation) be deemed to be in
the ordinary course of business: 

  

       | (A)  |   | any disposal (or deemed disposal for any
Tax purpose) of assets other than trading stock sold at arms length;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | any change in the use of an asset by any
Group Company;  
      
    | (C)  |   | anything which has the result of requiring a disposal
value to be brought into account, or which crystallises a balancing charge,
for capital allowances purposes (or has any similar effect under the laws of
any relevant foreign jurisdiction);  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | recovery of such Tax Liability is made under the
Warranties or under this Agreement or under statute or has already been made
under this Schedule 8;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (j)  |   | such Tax Liability would not have arisen but for the
winding up of, or the cessation of trade or business by, or a change in the
nature or conduct of the trade or business of, a Group Company on or after
Completion;  
      
    | (k)  |   | such Tax Liability arises or is increased in
consequence of any failure by the Purchaser to comply with any of its
obligations under this Schedule 8;  
      
    | (l)  |   | any Relief (other than a Purchasers Relief) is
available, or is for no consideration made available, to the relevant Group
Company to set against or otherwise mitigate the Tax Liability, and so
that:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | for this purpose any Relief arising in respect of
an accounting period falling partly before and partly after Completion shall
be apportioned on a time basis, unless some other basis is more reasonable;
and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | any Relief that is so available in relation to more
than one Tax Liability to which this Schedule 8 applies shall be deemed, so
far as possible, to be used in such a way as to reduce the maximum extent
possible the Sellers total liability under this Schedule;  
   

  

       | (m)  |   | the Tax Liability would not have arisen but
for:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   

(i) the making of a claim, election, surrender or disclaimer, the giving of a
notice or consent, or the doing of any other thing under the provisions of
any enactment or regulation relating to Tax, in each case after Completion by
the Purchaser or any Group Company, other than at the Sellers Representative
written request in accordance with Paragraph 7; 

   

(ii) the failure or omission on the part of any Group Company (other than at
the Sellers Representative written request in accordance with Paragraph 7)
to make any such valid claim, election, surrender or disclaimer, or to give
any such notice or consent or to do any other such thing, as the Sellers
Representative may require by written request in respect of periods or
matters for which the Sellers Representative has the conduct under Paragraph
7; 

   ##### 

  

  

       | (n)  |   | such Tax Liability arose or was deemed to arise
for the purposes of any Tax after Completion;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (o)  |   | such Tax Liability was taken into account in
calculating amounts due under the Earn Out Agreement;  
      
    | (p)  |   | such Tax Liability arises as a result of exercise of
share options by employees of a Group Company after Completion or the grant
of share options after Completion or the assignment or release of a share
option after Completion or the provision of a benefit in connection with a
share option after Completion provided that if the conversion of options
existing at the date of this Agreement takes place after Completion pursuant
to the assumption agreement entered into on or before Completion this
exclusion shall not apply to tax arising upon such conversion; and  
      
    | (q)  |   | such Tax Liability arises arises as a result of a
benefit provided by one Group Company to an employee of another Group Company
by means of a grant, exercise, assignment or variation of an option after
Completion and the employing Group Company fails to pay the Group Company
providing the benefit an adaquate amount as payment in respect of the benefit
or deemed benefit provided to the employees.  
   

  

     3.2  |   | For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers shall have no
liability under this Schedule in respect of any non-availability, inability
to use loss or restriction of any relief other than an Accounts Relief (
_failure of relief_ ) where such failure of relief does not give rise to
a Tax Liability to which Paragraph 2 applies.  
---|---|--- 
      
  3.3  |   | The provisions of Paragraph 3.1 of this Schedule shall also
operate to limit or reduce the liability of the Sellers in respect of claims
under the Tax Warranties and in any case when the provisions of Paragraph 3.1
conflict with the other provisions of the Agreement which apply in respect of
claims under this Schedule 8 or under the Tax Warranties then the provisions
of Paragraph 3.1 shall prevail.  
      
  3.4  |   | The financial and time limitations in Schedule 11 paragraphs
1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 shall apply to this liability under this Schedule
8.  
      
  3.5  |   | For the avoidance of doubt any claim against the Sellers (or
any number of them) pursuant to this Schedule 8 shall be satisfied solely and
exclusively in accordance with Schedule 9 and the Purchaser shall have no
recourse with respect to any such Claim against any Seller other than by way
of payment of Escrow Shares from the Escrow Account, except in the case of
fraud.  
      
  4.  |   | Payments Free of Withholding, etc.  
      
  4.1  |   | All payments made by the Sellers under this Schedule shall be
made gross, without deduction or withholding of any kind other than any
deduction or withholding required by Law.  
      
  4.2  |   | If the Sellers make a deduction or withholding required by
Law from a payment under this Schedule (other than a deduction or withholding
of tax in respect of a payment of interest under paragraph 6.4), the sum due
from the Sellers shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that,
after the making of any deduction or withholding, the Purchaser receives a
sum equal to the sum it would have received had no deduction or withholding
been made.  
      
  4.3  |   | If a payment under paragraph 2 or 4.2 will be or has been
subject to Tax, the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser the amount (after
taking into account Tax payable in respect of the amount) that will ensure
that the Purchaser receives and retains a net sum equal to the sum it would
have received had the payment not been subject to Tax.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     5.  |   | Appeals and Conduct of Claims  
---|---|--- 
      
  5.1  |   | The Sellers Representative shall be entitled, subject to the
remaining provisions of this Paragraph 5 and at the Sellers expense, to
resist any Assessment for and on behalf and in the name of the relevant Group
Company which is or could relate to a Tax Liability for which the Sellers
might be liable under Paragraph 2 or to resist any matter which could reduce
any Corresponding Saving, Over-provision or overpayment referred to at
Paragraph 8.  
      
  5.2  |   | If a Group Company or the Purchaser receives an Assessment
which may give rise to Tax Liability for which the Sellers might be liable
under paragraph 2 or which could result in a reduction of a Corresponding
Saving Over-Provision or overpayment as referred to in paragraph 8:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | the Purchaser shall as soon as reasonably
practicable give notice of the Assessment to the Sellers Representative, and
in any event within 10 Business Days but notice is not a condition precedent
to the Sellers liability under this Schedule; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | subject to paragraphs 5.3 to 5.5 inclusive, the
Purchaser shall, and shall ensure that each Group Company will, take any
action the Sellers Representative may reasonably request to avoid, dispute,
resist or compromise the Assessment if the Sellers have first agreed (to the
Purchasers reasonable satisfaction) to indemnify and secure the Purchaser
and each Group Company against the Tax, and any additional Tax and costs
which the Purchaser or each Group Company may incur in connection with the
taking of action pursuant to this paragraph.  
   

  

     5.3  |   | The Sellers shall keep the Purchaser fully informed of
all matters relating to the Assessment, deliver to the Sellers
Representative copies of all correspondence relating to the Assessment,
obtain the Purchasers prior written approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) to the appointment of solicitors or other professional
advisers, submit to the Purchaser for comments all correspondence and
documents relating to the Assessment which it intends to submit to a Tax
Authority and take into account all such reasonable comments as the Purchaser
may make;  
---|---|--- 
      
  5.4  |   | The Sellers rights (and those of the Sellers Representative)
under this paragraph cease if any steps are taken or legal proceedings are
started for a Sellers bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration or
re organisation or for the appointment of a receiver, administrator, trustee
or similar officer or if a Seller is unable to pay its debts as they fall
due, starts negotiations with a creditor with a view to the general
readjustment or rescheduling of its indebtedness or makes a general
assignment for the benefit of, or a composition with, its creditors unless a
Seller (or Sellers) who are not subject to such steps, proceedings, debt
repayment problems negotiations, readjustment, rescheduling,
provides reasonable security against costs connected with the Tax Liability
and dispute of the Assessment.  
   

  

     5.5  |   | The Purchaser is not obliged to take action pursuant to
this paragraph which involves contesting an Assessment beyond the first
appellate body (excluding the Tax Authority which has made the Assessment) in
the jurisdiction concerned unless leading counsel (with at least 10 years
call) or reasonable equivalent outside the United Kingdom appointed by the
Sellers Representative opines that such a course of action having regard to
the merits of the case, the size of the Tax Liability and any other relevant
factors is reasonable.  
---|---|--- 
      
  5.6  |   | The rights of the Sellers under this paragraph do not apply
if any Seller or a Group Company have committed an act or is responsible for
an omission which constitutes fraudulent or grossly negligent conduct in
relation to the Group Companys Tax affairs.

be unreasonably withheld where the Purchaser reasonably considers that:

     8.4  |   | If the new written determination referred to at
Paragraph 8.3 states that the original written determination should be
amended, an adjusting payment equal to the difference between the sum in the
original written determination and the sum in the amended written
determination shall be made by the Sellers or the Purchaser (as appropriate)
as soon as reasonably practicable.  
---|---|--- 
      
  8.5  |   | For the purposes of this Paragraph 5, a Corresponding Saving

progress of any such action for the purpose of making recovery in accordance

withheld pursuant to paragraph 4.2(b)(i) above is Settled, on the first
Business Day following the date of such Settlement, the
Sellers Representative and the Purchaser shall serve a Joint Transfer
Instruction upon the Escrow Agents instructing the Escrow Agents to promptly
authorise the Bank to transfer or cause to be transferred to the Sellers
Representative the number of Escrow Shares, if any, by which: (a) the number
of Escrow Shares that were withheld in the Escrow Account with respect to
such Relevant Claim pursuant to Section 4.2(b)(i); _exceeds_ (b) the number
of Escrow Settlement Shares transferred to the Purchaser with respect to the
Settlement of such Relevant Claim.

---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | the aggregate number of Escrow Settlement Shares that
are due to be, but have not yet been, transferred to the Purchaser in respect
of Relevant Claims (other than Seller Claims) that were Settled on or prior
to the Final Release Date; _plus_   
      
    | (c)  |   | if, by the Final Release Date, a Seller Claim either
has not been Settled or, if Settled, any portion of the Settled Amount has
not been paid to the Purchaser as of the Final Release Date, the number of
Escrow Shares (rounded up to the nearest whole share) equal to: (A) the
quotient of: (1) either: (x) the Claimed Amount of such Seller Claim; or (y)
if such Seller Claim has been Settled, an amount equal to the unpaid portion
of the Settled Amount of such Seller Claim (in each case translated into
Euro at the Exchange Rate, if necessary); _divided by_ (2) the Average
Purchaser Share Price as of the Final Release Date (which number of Escrow

paragraph 4.5(c) together with any other Escrow Shares which have previously
been the subject of Settlements of Seller Claims against the relevant
Seller and not otherwise previously distributed to such Seller.

prior to the Final Release Date, the number of Escrow Shares (rounded up to
the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of: (A) either: (1) the
Claimed Amount of such Reimbursement Claim, to the extent not otherwise
withheld in the Escrow Account pursuant to Section 4.2(b)(v); or (2) if such
Reimbursement Claim has been Settled but not yet satisfied out of the Escrow
Shares, the Settled Amount of such Seller Claim (in each case translated

Settled on or prior to the Final Release Date, and the Settled Amount thereof
has not been fully paid to the Purchaser by the Final Release Date, on the
first Business Day following the Final Release Date, the Purchaser and the
Sellers Representative shall serve a Joint Transfer Instruction upon the
Escrow Agents instructing the Escrow Agents to promptly authorise the Bank to

withheld from the Sellers Representative pursuant to paragraph 4.5(c) or
paragraph 4.5(d) above, as the case may be, with respect to an amount equal

Representative and/or the Purchaser following the Final Release Date in
accordance with paragraphs 4.5 and/or 4.6 above, such Escrow Shares shall
be retained in the Escrow Account pending the Settlement of any Relevant

withheld in the Escrow Account pursuant to paragraph 4.5(c) or paragraph
4.5(d) with respect to a Seller Claim or Reimbursement Claim, as the case may

  5.  |   | RELEVANT CLAIM DISPUTES  
      
  5.1  |   | In the event that the Sellers Representative makes an
Information Request regarding a Relevant Claim within 30 Business Days after
receipt of the applicable Claim Notice as referred to in paragraph 3.2 above,
the Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers Representative within 10 Business
Days of receipt of such Information Request a certificate signed by a
duly authorised officer of the Purchaser holding the title of Vice President
or above stating the circumstances giving rise to the Relevant Claim in
question and providing a basis for the Purchasers estimate of the maximum
amount that may reasonably be claimed in respect thereof (the "Purchasers
Estimate") and formally stating (or re-stating, as the case may be)
the amount so claimed (the "Purchasers Certificate"). Within 20 Business
Days of receipt of a Purchasers Certificate, the Sellers Representative
shall serve written notice (the "Sellers Notice") on the Purchaser accepting
or rejecting the bona fides of the Relevant Claim set out in the Claim Notice
and/or accepting or rejecting the amount of the Purchasers Estimate. Insofar
as the Sellers Representative rejects the amount of the Purchasers Estimate,
the Sellers Notice shall include the Sellers Representatives estimate of
the maximum amount that may reasonably be claimed in respect of the Relevant
Claim in question (the "Sellers Estimate") and the basis for the Sellers
Estimate.  
      
  5.2  |   | Following receipt of a Sellers Notice rejecting the Relevant
Claim and/or the quantum thereof, the Purchaser jointly with the Sellers
Representative shall attempt in good faith to resolve the difference of
opinion between the parties, including as to any difference between the
amount of the Sellers Estimate and the amount of the Purchasers Estimate.
Any successful resolution of such difference shall be evidenced in writing
signed by a representative of the Purchaser and by the Sellers
Representative.  
      
  5.3  |   | If the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative fail to
resolve their difference of opinion within 15 Business Days after the
Sellers Notice is delivered to the Purchaser and such difference of opinion
relates to the maximum amount that may reasonably be claimed in respect of
the Relevant Claim in question (such difference of opinion being referred to
as a "Claim Dispute"), the Sellers Representative shall have 10 Business
Days thereafter to deliver a written demand to the Purchaser of its right to
resolve such Claim Dispute in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs
5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 below (a "Written Demand"). Failure to make a
Written Demand within such 10 Business Day period shall mean that the
Sellers Representative has accepted the amount of the Purchasers Estimate
solely for the purposes set out in paragraphs 4.2(b)(i) and 4.5(a) above
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, no Relevant Claim shall by reason thereof
be deemed to be Settled) and shall be without prejudice to the right of the
Sellers to resist any and all claims in respect of the Relevant Claim or
Relevant Claims in question.  
      
  5.4  |   | In the event the Sellers Representative makes a Written
Demand, the Claim Dispute shall be submitted for determination by a board of
three experts (the "Experts", and each an "Expert"). Each of the Purchaser
and the Sellers Representative shall have the right to appoint one Expert
and the two Experts so appointed by them shall select a third Expert, all of
whom shall be qualified by education, knowledge and experience in the
appropriate field or discipline relating to the substance of the Relevant
Claim that is the subject of the Claim  
   

    ##### 

 

    

       |   | Dispute. The Sellers Representatives Written Demand
shall state the name, position, address, phone number, email address (if any)
and experience of its Expert and, within 5 Business Days after receipt of the
Written Demand, the Purchaser shall provide the Sellers Representative with
written notice stating the name, position, address, phone number,
email address (if any) and experience of its Expert. If the Purchaser fails
to name its Expert within the said 5 Business Day period, the Sellers
Representative shall name a second Expert. If the two Experts so named shall
fail within 10 Business Days after the appointment of the second Expert to
agree upon and to select a third Expert (the "Third Expert"), then either of
the Purchaser or the Sellers Representative may thereafter request the
President of the Law Society of England and Wales from time to time to select
the Expert or Experts to complete the board of three. Should the Third Expert
be or become unwilling or unable to act, another shall be selected in the
same manner. In the event that either Expert named by the Purchaser and the
Sellers Representative is or becomes unwilling or unable to act, the party
selecting that Expert shall select another Expert within a reasonable time of
learning of the unwillingness or inability of the original Expert to act. A
person selected or appointed as an Expert may not be (a) in the regular salary
employ of either of the Purchaser or any of the Sellers or Affiliates
thereof; (b) a consultant or legal counsel for either the Purchaser or any of
the Sellers, or (c) a person who has previously voted as an expert or
arbitrator against any of the Purchaser or any of the Sellers or has
represented others in proceedings against one of them. For the purposes
of resolving the Claim Dispute, the Experts shall act as experts and not as
arbitrators and the Arbitration Act 1996 shall not apply.  
---|---|--- 
      
  5.5  |   | The jurisdiction of the Experts shall be limited to resolving
the Claim Dispute and the scope of the review shall be limited to reviewing
the Purchasers Certificate and the Sellers Notice and the supporting
documentation and evidence referred to in the next following sentence. Both
the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall have the right to
submit supporting documentation or evidence in writing to support the amount
of the Purchasers Estimate or the Sellers Estimate, as the case may be, but
neither the Purchaser nor the Sellers Representative shall have the right to
change the amount of the Purchasers Estimate or the Sellers Estimate, as
the case may be, such amounts being deemed conclusively as the Purchasers
and the Sellers best estimate of the maximum amount that may reasonably
be claimed in respect of the Relevant Claim in question. The Claim Dispute
shall be decided by a majority vote of the Experts within ten (10) Business
Days from appointment of the Third Expert. The Experts shall be directed to
resolve the Claim Dispute by choosing between the amount of the Purchasers
Estimate and the amount of the Sellers Estimate that is closest to the
amount that the Experts, based on their experience and the information
submitted by the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative, believe most
closely represents the maximum amount that may reasonably be claimed in
respect of the Relevant Claim in question and the Experts shall not be
authorised to select a different amount (i.e., the Experts shall only be able
to choose either the amount of the Purchasers Estimate or the amount of the
Sellers Estimate and not a different amount) (the amount so selected by the
Experts being referred to herein as the "Approved Amount"). The Experts shall
inform the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative in writing of the
Approved Amount immediately after making their decision. The party whose
estimate of the maximum amount that may reasonably be claimed in respect of
the Relevant Claim in question was not selected by the Experts shall be
responsible for reimbursing the prevailing party for all of its reasonable
out of pocket costs incurred in deriving the Purchasers Estimate or the
Sellers Estimate (as the case may be), including, without limitation, all
reasonable attorneys fees, accounting fees, expert fees, costs associated
with preparing for the Claim Dispute resolution process provided for hereby,
travel and lodging costs, and other fees and expenses, and shall also be
responsible for paying all of the costs associated with the Claim Dispute
resolution process provided for hereby, including any and all fees and
expenses of all three Experts (including the Expert selected by the
prevailing party), and any and all expenses reasonably incurred by all three
Experts in connection with the Claim Dispute resolution process provided for
hereby.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

     5.6  |   | The Approved Amount shall be deemed to be the figure to
be used in calculating the number of Escrow Shares to be withheld from those
Escrow Shares due to be transferred to the Sellers Representative from the
Escrow Account for the account of the Sellers on the First Release Date or
the Final Release Date, as applicable, in respect of the Relevant Claim in
question for the purposes of paragraphs 4.2(b)(i) and 4.5(a) above.  
---|---|--- 
      
  5.7  |   | If Escrow Shares have been withheld pursuant to paragraph
4.2(b)(i) or paragraph 4.5(a) above and the Approved Amount is the amount of
the Sellers Estimate, the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall
forthwith serve a Joint Transfer Instruction upon the Escrow
Agents instructing the Escrow Agents to promptly authorise the Bank to
transfer to the Sellers Representative the number of Escrow Shares
representing the difference between the number of Escrow Shares (rounded up
to the nearest whole share) calculated by (A) deducting the Approved Amount
from the Unsettled Relevant Claim Amount in question and (B) dividing the
product derived from the calculation referred to in (A) by the Average
Purchaser Share Price as of the First Release Date or the Final Release Date,
as applicable, in respect of the Unsettled Relevant Claim Amount in question
in accordance with paragraphs 4.2(b)(i) and 4.5(a) above. In addition, the
Purchaser shall pay all costs required to be paid or reimbursed in
accordance with paragraph 5.5 above which shall be paid by the Purchaser to
the Sellers Representative (whose receipt shall be a good discharge
therefor). In the event that the Approved Amount is the amount of the
Purchasers Estimate, the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser all
costs required to be reimbursed or paid by the Sellers Representative in
accordance with paragraph 5.5 above.  
      
  5.8  |   | The provisions of this Schedule 9 shall be without prejudice
to the rights of any party to this Agreement to bring Proceedings in
accordance with the provisions of clause 26 and, without limitation to the
generality of the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall limit the ability
of the Purchaser to bring Proceedings in respect of a Relevant Claim in
accordance with the provisions of that Clause.

Conduct of Proceedings 

   

     1.  |   | Third party claims  
---|---|--- 
      
  1.1  |   | In the event of an assertion or any commencement by any
person of any claim, action or proceeding against the Purchaser or any Group
Company which may result in a Relevant Claim being made by the Purchaser,
whether or not the Escrow remains in effect, (a "third party claim"), the
Purchaser shall have the sole right to proceed with the defence of any such
third party claim, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers
Representative, and shall procure that notice of such third party claim is
promptly given to the Sellers Representative after the Purchaser becomes
aware of such third party claim _provided, however,_ that any failure on the
part of the Purchaser to so notify the Sellers Representative shall not
limit any of the obligations of the Sellers under this Agreement (except to
the extent such failure prejudices the defence of such third party claim).  
      
  1.2  |   | Subject always to the entitlement of legal professional
privilege, at the Purchasers cost and subject to the entry into of
appropriate confidentiality agreements, the Sellers shall provide reasonable
co-operation to the Purchaser in connection with any third party
claim, including the Sellers providing the Purchaser with reasonable access
to relevant records and information.  
      
  1.3  |   | If the Purchaser makes any admission of liability, agreement,
settlement, adjustment or compromise in relation to any such third party
claim without obtaining the express prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative to such admission, agreement, settlement, adjustment or
compromise (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
the Purchaser shall not be able to make any Relevant Claim in relation to the
matters, events or circumstances to which the relevant third party claim
relates. If the Sellers Representative provides such express prior written
consent then this shall be without prejudice to any defence the Sellers may
have to any Relevant Claim made by the Purchaser in relation to the matters,
events or circumstances to which the relevant third party claim relates.  
      
  1.4  |   | In no circumstances shall the Purchaser make any admission of
liability, agreement, settlement, adjustment or compromise in relation to any
third party claim if to do so would result in liability to any current or
former director, officer or employee of any Group Company.  
      
  2.  |   | Relevant Claims  
      
  2.1  |   | In the event that the Purchaser brings a Relevant Claim or
otherwise seeks to recover any loss or damage pursuant to a claim against the
Escrow Shares held in the Escrow Account from time to time, the Sellers
Representative may at his option undertake the defence thereof
by representatives of his own choosing.  
      
  2.2  |   | So long as the Sellers Representative has assumed the
defence of any Relevant Claim or other claim in the manner set out in
paragraph 2.1 above, the Sellers Representative shall have the exclusive
right to contest, defend and litigate such Relevant Claim or other claim and
shall have the exclusive right, in his sole discretion, to settle any such
Relevant Claim or other claim, either before or after the initiation of
litigation at such time and on such terms as the Sellers Representative
deems appropriate.  
      
  2.3  |   | Subject to entry into of appropriate confidentiality
agreements, the Purchaser shall provide the Sellers Representative at the
Sellers Representative cost with reasonable access to relevant  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   | records and other information that shall be reasonably
requested (subject to entry into appropriate confidentiality agreements) for
defending against a Relevant Claim.  
---|---|--- 
     |   |   
      
  2.4  |   | The Purchaser agrees that it will not bring any claim against
a Group Company in respect of which any Seller may have any liability under
the terms of this Agreement.

---|---|--- 
      
  1.1  |   | In respect of any and all Relevant Claims (other than Seller
Claims or claims with respect to the Company Warranty in paragraph 4 of Part
B of Schedule 4) or claims for wilful default by the Company to comply with
any Company Covenant (and any related claim by the Purchaser for interest and
costs in relation to such Relevant Claims as limited by this paragraph 1.1):  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | such Relevant Claim shall be satisfied solely and
exclusively by the transfer to the Purchaser of Escrow Shares out of the
Escrow Account in accordance with Schedule 9;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | the maximum aggregate amount recoverable by the
Purchaser in respect thereof shall be limited to the value of the Escrow
Shares standing to the credit of the Escrow Account on the date such Relevant
Claim is settled (calculated in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 9)
and the Purchaser shall have no right to claim for any shortfall relating
thereto; and  
      
    | (c)  |   | the Purchaser shall have no recourse with respect to
such Relevant Claims against any Seller other than by way of payment of
Escrow Shares from the Escrow Account in accordance with the provisions of
Schedule 9 and no Seller shall have any other liability or responsibility of
any nature in respect of such Relevant Claims.  
   

  

     1.2  |   | No claim may be made by the Purchaser in respect of a
Relevant Claim (other than a Warranty Claim with respect to the Company
Warranty in paragraph 4 of Part B of Schedule 4 or a Seller Claim or
Reimbursement Claims):

    | (b)  |   | unless and until the amount that would otherwise be
recoverable (but for this paragraph 1.2(b)) in respect of that Relevant
Claim, when aggregated with any other amount or amounts recoverable in
respect of other Relevant Claims (excluding any amounts in respect of a
Relevant Claim for which no liability arises due to paragraph 1.2(a)),
exceeds 3,000,000 and, in the event that the aggregated amounts
exceed 3,000,000, the Purchaser may only seek to recover the amount of the
excess over 3,000,000.  
   

  

     1.3  |   | The maximum liability of each Seller in respect of any
Seller Claim, or a Warranty Claim with respect to the Company Warranty in
paragraph 4 of Part B of Schedule 4; or a claim for wilful default by the
Company to comply with any Company Covenant, shall not exceed the
Consideration payable to such Seller in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Earn Out Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
      
  1.4  |   | Any monetary sum to be taken into account for the purposes of
this Schedule 11 to determine whether a monetary limit or threshold has been
reached or exceeded, where that sum is expressed in a currency other than
Euro, shall be translated into Euro at the Exchange Rate.

     2.  |   | Time limits for bringing Warranty Claims  
---|---|--- 
      
  2.1  |   | No person shall be liable for any Warranty Claim unless the
Sellers Representative receives from the Purchaser a Claim Notice in respect
of such Warranty Claim:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | in the case of a Warranty Claim (other than a Tax
Claim, an IP Claim, a claim in respect of Seller Warranty or a matter in
paragraph 4 of Part B of Schedule 4), on or before the date falling two years
after Completion; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | in the case of an IP Claim, a Tax Claim, or a Warranty
Claim in respect of a Seller Warranty or matter in paragraph 4 of Part B of
Schedule 4, on or before the date falling three years after Completion.  
   

  

     2.2  |   | Subject (in relation to a liability which is
contingent) to paragraph 4, any such Warranty Claim shall (if it has not been
previously satisfied, settled or withdrawn) be unenforceable by the Purchaser
on the expiry of six months starting on the date of a Claim Notice
unless Proceedings in respect of such Warranty Claim have been commenced by
being issued and validly served, in accordance with this Agreement, on the
Sellers Representative within that time.  
---|---|--- 
      
  3.  |   | Limitation on the personal liability of the Sellers  
      
    |   | In relation to any Relevant Claim, other than a Seller Claim or
a claim with respect to the Company Warranty in paragraph 4 of Part B of
Schedule 4 or claims for wilful default by the Company to comply with any
Company Covenant, the Purchaser irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
right to recourse against any and all of the Sellers or their respective
assets and instead shall seek payment or other discharge in respect of such
Relevant Claim solely from the Escrow Shares standing to the credit of the
Escrow Account from time to time.  
      
  4.  |   | Contingent liabilities  
      
    |   | The Purchaser shall have no recourse in respect of any
liability which is contingent under any of the Warranties unless and until
such time as such contingent liability ceases to be so contingent. This
paragraph shall not operate to avoid a claim made in respect of a contingent
liability within the time limits specified in paragraph 2.1 of this Schedule
11 and containing such details as are specified in paragraph 2.1 of this
Schedule 11 provided that any such contingent liability becomes an actual
liability before the later of (1) the Final Release Date; and (2) the date
which is 6 months from the date of the Claim Notice.  
      
  5.  |   | Provisions  
      
  5.1  |   | No claim may be made in respect of any claim for a breach of
any of the Warranties if an allowance, provision or reserve is made for the
matter giving rise to such claim in the Accounts (and not subsequently
released).  
      
  6.  |   | Voluntary acts, etc.  
      
  6.1  |   | No claim may be made under the Warranties in respect of any
matter, act, omission or circumstance (or any combination thereof)
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the aggravation of a matter or
circumstance) to the extent that such claim would not, or would not have been
likely to, have occurred or been aggravated but for:  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (a)  |   | any voluntary act, omission or transaction of the
Purchaser or any member of the Purchasers Group or any of the Group
Companies, or their respective directors, employees or agents or successors
in title, after Completion other than an act, omission or transaction which
is in the ordinary course of business as normally carried on by the Group
Companies at the date of this Agreement. For the purposes of this paragraph
6.1, an act or omission should not be regarded as "voluntary" or
"deliberate" if it is done or affected: (i) at the written request or with
the written consent of the Sellers Representative; or (ii) in order to
comply with any Law in force at the date of this Agreement, or any
contractual obligation of a Group Company in force at the date of this
Agreement and applicable to the relevant Group company; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | the passing of, or any change in, after the date of
this Agreement, any Law (including the interpretation thereof).  
   

  

     6.2  |   | To the extent that the matter giving rise to the claim
under the Warranties (the "Relevant Loss") is a claim for which the Purchaser
or any member of the Purchaser Group has a right of recovery against, or an
indemnity from, a person other than the Company or the Sellers, whether under
a provision of applicable law, Insurance Policy or otherwise, the
Purchaser shall use its reasonable endeavours to pursue all such rights of
recovery prior to making a claim pursuant to any Warranty in respect of such
matter, provided that nothing in this paragraph 6.2 shall oblige the
Purchaser to take any steps to recover any sum which is likely to materially
adversely affect the business of the Purchaser or its group taken as a
whole.

  6.3  |   | If the Purchaser and/or a Group Company has used its
reasonable endeavours for a period of six months to recover the Relevant Loss
from an insurer, third party or otherwise, but has not recovered the Relevant
Loss in full, it shall no longer be precluded by virtue of paragraph
6.2 from recovering any unrecovered amount from the Sellers or the Company
(as relevant) under this Agreement but it shall continue to comply with its
obligations to seek to recover the Relevant Loss pursuant to paragraph 6.2 of
this Schedule 11.  
      
  6.4  |   | If the Purchaser and/or Group Company recovers an amount from
the insurer or other third party in respect of the Relevant Loss, any claim
that may be made against the Sellers and/or the Company (as relevant) shall
be reduced by and to the extent of the amount, if any, by which the Relevant
Loss amount so recovered _exceeds_ the reasonable costs incurred by
the Purchaser or the Group Company in recovering such Relevant Loss.  
      
  7.  |   | Recovery only once  
      
    |   | The Purchaser is not entitled to recover more than once in
respect of any one matter giving rise to a claim under the Warranties.  
      
  8.  |   | Recovery from another person  
      
  8.1  |   | If the Purchaser is entitled to be paid an amount in respect
of a Relevant Claim (including by way of a payment from the Escrow Account)
and the Purchaser or any member of the Purchasers Group subsequently
recovers or is or becomes entitled to recover from another person an amount
which is referable to the matter giving rise to the claim, the
Purchaser shall promptly after receiving such recovery or becoming entitled
to receive such recovery notify the Sellers Representative, and:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | if the Purchaser has already received an amount
in satisfaction of such claim from a Seller or the Escrow Account and the
amount so received in respect of such claim is more than the Sum Recovered
(as defined in paragraph 8.2 below), the Purchaser shall promptly after
receipt pay to (i) the Seller who paid the amount in satisfaction of

     | (b)  |   | if the Purchaser has already received an amount in
satisfaction of such claim from a Seller or the Escrow Account and the amount
so received in respect of such claim is less than or equal to the Sum
Recovered, the Purchaser shall promptly after receipt pay to (i) the Seller
who paid the amount in satisfaction of such claim or, (ii) if the Purchaser
received payment of an amount in satisfaction of such claim from the
Escrow Account, the Escrow Account, an amount equal to the amount received by
the Purchaser from the relevant Seller or the Escrow Account in respect
thereof; and  
      
    | (c)  |   | if the Purchaser has not already received an amount in
satisfaction of such claim from a Seller or the Escrow Account, the amount of
such claim to which the Purchaser would otherwise be entitled to receive from
the relevant Seller or from the Escrow Account pursuant to Schedule 9 shall
be reduced by and to the extent of the Sum Recovered.  
   

  

     8.2  |   | For the purposes of paragraph 8.1 above, "Sum
Recovered" means an amount equal to the total of the amount recovered from
the other person less all reasonable costs incurred by any member of the
Purchasers Group in recovering the amount from the person.  
---|---|--- 
      
  9.  |   | Mitigation  
      
    |   | Nothing in this Schedule 11 restricts or limits the general
obligation at law of the Purchaser to mitigate any loss or damage which it
may incur in consequence of a matter giving rise to a claim under any of the
Warranties.  
      
  10.  |   | General  
      
  10.1  |   | Nothing in this Agreement shall have the effect of limiting
or restricting any recourse of the Purchaser in respect of any claim arising
as a result of any fraud.  
      
  10.2  |   | Nothing in paragraphs 4 through 9 (inclusive) above shall
apply in relation to any Tax Claim.  
      
  10.3  |   | Any amount paid to the Purchaser in respect of a Relevant
Claim shall be deemed to be a reduction in the Consideration due to each
Seller pursuant to this Agreement.  
      
  10.4  |   | Insofar as any claim is made against any of the Sellers by
any person other than the Purchaser including any other person to whom this
Agreement may be novated or assigned, the limitations of liability contained
in this Schedule 11 shall apply. References in this Schedule 11 to the
"Purchaser" and to any obligations of the "Purchaser" shall be construed
so as to apply to any such other person including any other person to whom
this Agreement is novated or assigned.  
      
  10.5  |   | Subject to the provisions of Clauses 5 and 22, the sole
remedy of the Purchaser for any breach of Warranty and of the Seller for any
breach of the Purchaser Warranties shall be an action for damages and neither
the Purchaser nor the Sellers shall be entitled to rescind or repudiate this
Agreement as a result thereof and none of the Company, the Purchaser or any
of the Sellers shall be liable (in equity or tort, under the
Misrepresentation Act 1967 or in any other way) in respect of any
misrepresentation provided that nothing herein shall affect the Sellers or
the Purchasers rights or remedies in respect of a fraudulent
misrepresentation.

Schedule 12 

   

Form of Non-Competition Agreement 

   

NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT 

   

 This Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement (the " _Agreement_ ") is being executed and delivered as of ___2005 by ___(the " _Security Holder_ ") in favor of, and for the benefit of: eBay Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Purchaser_ "); Skype Technologies S.A., a limited company registered under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (the " _Company_ "); and the other Beneficiaries. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth in Section 19. 

  

Recitals 

   

 A. The Security Holder is a key employee, shareholder, optionholder and/or other security holder of the Company or its Affiliates and has obtained extensive and valuable knowledge and confidential information concerning the businesses of the Company and its Affiliates. 

  

 B. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Purchaser, the Company, the shareholders of the Company and certain other parties are entering into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), providing for the acquisition by the Purchaser of all equity securities of the Company and the intended conversion of all outstanding options to acquire shares of the Company into options to acquire shares of the Purchaser. Immediately following the sale of shares contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, the businesses of the Company and its Affiliates will be conducted by the Purchaser through the Company and its Affiliates. 

  

 C. [ _Note to draft: this recital and other applicable bracketed provisions hereof will only be included in the noncompetition agreements for those persons who remain employees of Skype/eBay after the closing_.] [The Security Holder will be offered employment (the " _Employment Offer_ ") with the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser following the Effective Date as a result of which the Security Holder will receive substantial benefits in addition to those currently enjoyed by the Security Holder as an employee of the Company (the Security Holders employment with the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser following the Effective Date is referred to herein as the " _Security Holder s Employment_"). After the Effective Date, the Security Holder will obtain extensive and valuable knowledge, trade secrets and other confidential information concerning the business of the Purchaser and its Affiliates.] 

  

 D. The Purchaser has requested, as a condition precedent to the execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement and to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, that the Security Holder execute and deliver this Agreement. 

  

 Now, Therefore, in order to induce the Purchaser to execute and deliver the Purchase Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Security Holder agrees as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

Agreement 

   

 1. Acknowledgements by the Security Holder. The Security Holder acknowledges that: 

  

 (a) as a consequence of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement: (i) the Purchaser will acquire all of the securities of the Company owned by the Security Holder and other selling shareholders of the Company in exchange for the consideration stated in the Purchase Agreement; and (ii) the Security Holder will receive substantial benefits, directly or indirectly; 

   

 (b) by virtue of the Security Holders position with the Company, he has developed considerable expertise in the business operations of the Company and the Companys Affiliates and has had extensive access to trade secrets and other confidential information of the Company and the Companys Affiliates; 

   

 (c) to enable the Purchaser to reap the benefits of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser reasonably expects that the Security Holder should refrain from carrying on certain activities as set forth in this Agreement; 

   

 (d) the Purchaser and the other Beneficiaries would be irreparably damaged and the Purchasers substantial investment in the Company would be materially impaired, if the Security Holder were to enter into an activity or take any action in violation of the terms of this Agreement; and 

   

 (e) the terms and conditions of this Agreement are fair and reasonable to the Security Holder in all respects and the restraints imposed herein and the enforcement of the terms and conditions hereof will not lead to any undue hardship or inconvenience or cause the Security Holder to be unable to engage in lawful professions, trades or businesses. 

   

 2. Effective Date. This Agreement shall become effective upon the consummation of the share purchase contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the date of the consummation of such share purchase being referred to as the " _Effective Date_ "). 

  

 3. Non-Competition. 

  

 (a) During the Restricted Period, the Security Holder shall not, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser own, manage, operate, join, control, finance or participate in the ownership, management, operation, control or financing of or be connected as an officer, director, employee, shareholder, Affiliate, promoter, manager, partner, principal, licensor (other than as a licensor of a generally available right or software application), agent, representative, advisor or consultant of, for or to, any Person engaged in any business anywhere in the world: 

  

(i) whose business or operations comprises in any respect (other than an
incidental or ancillary or immaterial respect) an Internet voice
communications product or service or technology, Internet telephony product
or service or technology, Internet essentially multidirectional video
communications product or service or technology and/or any other product or
service or technology in respect of which at least one of the foregoing
(Internet voice communications product or service or technology, Internet
telephony product or service or technology and/or Internet essentially
multidirectional video communications product or service or technology) is
a 

     ##### 

  

    

principal component, including without limitation such business or operations
of Microsoft Corporation, Google Inc., Yahoo! Inc. or their Affiliates; or 

  

(ii) whose business or operations comprises in any respect (other than an
incidental or ancillary or immaterial respect) the use of the Internet to
provide a service to effect payments to on-line merchants by consumers by the
use of an electronic purse or wallet; or 

  

(iii) that otherwise competes in any respect (other than an ancillary or
secondary respect) with the business or operations of the Company or any
Affiliate of the Company (which was an Affiliate at or within two years prior
to the Effective Date) immediately prior to, or within two years prior to,
the Effective Date, 

  

(the business and activity described in this Section 3(a) being referred to in
this Agreement collectively as the " _Restricted Business_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, a service, product or technology which is essentially a
single directional service, product or technology, including without
limitation streaming, podcasting or broadcasting, is not a Restricted
Business. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3(a), the Security Holder shall not be deemed to be in contravention of the provisions of Section 3(a): (i) if the Security Holder owns shares as a passive investor in an entity engaged in a Restricted Business, provided that: (A) such shares are actively traded on an established national securities market in the United States or Europe or a recognised investment exchange (as defined in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) and (B) the number of shares of such entitys capital stock that are owned beneficially (directly or indirectly) by the Security Holder and the number of shares of such entitys capital stock that are owned beneficially (directly or indirectly) by the Security Holders Affiliates collectively represent less than five percent (5%) of the total number of shares of such entitys capital stock outstanding; (ii) as a "licensee" or "sublicensee" of an entity engaged in a Restricted Business if the Security Holder is a licensee or sublicensee solely as a customer of such entity; (iii) if the Security Holder provides financing (as a passive financier) to, or is connected as a passive equity holder or a passive partner in, any Person engaged in a business that is not a Restricted Business, and subsequently such Person becomes engaged in a Restricted Business, so long the Security Holder does not: (A) serve as a member of the board of directors (or similar body) or officer of such Person; (B) have the ability to procure the election or appoint any director (or similar person) of such Person or the ability to influence management of such Person; and (C) otherwise become actively involved (as an employee, consultant, adviser or otherwise) in the operations of such Person; (iv) as a result of the Security Holder being an employee, shareholder, officer, director, manager, representative, adviser or consultant of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company; or (v) if the Security Holder has any interest in or provides services to or is a director, officer or advisor of a Person that does not carry on a business that is a Restricted Business, and the Security Holder is not otherwise in breach of this Agreement as a result of such interest or services. In addition, Joltid Limited shall not be deemed to be a Restricted Business solely because it develops peer-to-peer technology for, and licenses peer-to-peer technology to, the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, no Security Holder will be deemed to be in breach of Section 3(a) hereof by virtue of owning, managing, operating, joining, controlling, financing or participating in the ownership, management, operation, control or financing of, or be connected as an officer, director, employee, shareholder, Affiliate, promoter, manager, partner, principal, licensor (other than as a licensor of a generally available software right or application), agent, representative, advisor or consultant of Joltid Limited so long as Joltid Limited is not in material breach of the license agreement between Skype Technologies S.A. and Joltid Limited. In addition, Ambient Sound Investments OY shall not be deemed to be a Restricted Business solely because it provides consulting services to the Company. For the 

    ##### 

  

    

avoidance of doubt, no Security Holder will be deemed to be in breach of
Section 3(a) hereof by virtue of owning, managing, operating, joining,
controlling, financing or participating in the ownership, management,
operation, control or financing of, or be connected as an officer, director,
employee, shareholder, Affiliate, promoter, manager, partner, principal,
licensor (other than as a licensor of a generally available software right or
application), agent, representative, advisor or consultant of Ambient
Sound Investments OY so long as Ambient Sound Investments OY is not in
material breach of the consulting engagement agreement between Skype
Technologies S.A. (or any of its Affiliates) and Ambient Sound Investments
OY. 

   

 _[ Note to draft: The references to Ambient Sound Investments OY and Joltid Limited will be deleted from the version for Michael Jackson and Geoffrey Prentice. The reference to Ambient Sound Investments OY will be deleted from the version for Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis. The reference to Joltid Limited will be deleted from the version for Toivo Annus, Jaan Tallinn, Priit Kasesalu and Ahti Heinla.]_ 

  

 (c) A business which is a Restricted Business shall cease to be a Restricted Business six months after it is no longer being carried on by any of the Company or its Affiliates. 

   

 4. Non-Interference. 

  

 (a) During the Restricted Period, the Security Holder shall not personally or through others, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, solicit, attempt to solicit, induce or attempt to induce (on the Security Holders own behalf or on behalf of any other Person) any Company Specified Person or Purchaser Specified Person to terminate his employment or other relationship with the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to: (i) employees who leave the employ of the Purchaser under circumstances not involving any solicitation, attempt at solicitation, inducement or attempt at inducement by the Security Holder; or (ii) employees who respond to general advertisements or other general solicitations not specifically targeted at employees of the Purchaser. 

   

 (b) During the Restricted Period, the Security Holder shall not personally or through others, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser: (i) induce or attempt to induce any Company Business Contact to terminate any of its relationships with the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser; or (ii) otherwise take any action relating to any such Company Business Contact that at the time of such action would reasonably be expected to be disadvantageous to the business of the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser (other than any action with only an incidental or immaterial effect on the business of the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser). 

   

 5. Representations and Warranties. The Security Holder represents and warrants, to and for the benefit of the Beneficiaries, that: (a) the Security Holder has full power and capacity to execute and deliver, and to perform all of the Security Holders obligations under, this Agreement; and (b) neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the performance of this Agreement will result directly or indirectly in a violation or breach of any Contract or obligation by which the Security Holder or any of the Security Holders Affiliates is or may be bound. 

  

 5A. Breaches. The Purchaser shall not be entitled to exercise its rights under this Agreement against the Security Holder as a result of a breach of any provision of this Agreement which is capable of being rectified or remedied without first complying with this Section 5A. If 

   ##### 

  

 

such breach is capable of being rectified or remedied, then the Purchaser
shall issue the Security Holder a notice: 

   

 (a) referring to the breach and the relevant section of this Agreement; and 

  

 (b) requiring the Security Holder to rectify or remedy the breach within 30 days after the date on which the Security Holder receives the notice; and 

  

 (c) in relation to a breach of Section 3(a) of this Agreement by the Security Holder, requiring the Security Holder to take demonstrable action (within 15 days after the date on which the Security Holder receives the notice) to rectify or remedy that breach as expeditiously as possible. 

  

 If either: 

  

 (i) the breach referred to in the above notice is not rectified within the 30 day period referred to in the above notice; or 

  

 (ii) the Security Holder has not taken demonstrable action within the 15 day period referred to in the above notice to rectify or remedy the breach as expeditiously as possible, in respect of a breach of Section 3(a), 

  

 then the Purchaser shall be immediately entitled to exercise all of its rights against the Security Holder under this Agreement after the expiry of that 15 day period or 30 day period (as the case may be). For the avoidance of doubt, where a breach of this Agreement is not capable of being rectified or remedied, the Purchaser shall be entitled to exercise all of its rights under this Agreement which arise from such breach of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5A shall prevent the Purchaser from seeking relief against a third party in relation to any circumstance which may give rise to a breach of this Agreement. 

  

 6. Independence of Obligations. The covenants of the Security Holder set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as independent of any other agreement or arrangement between the Security Holder, on the one hand, and the Company or the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, and the existence of any claim or cause of action by the Security Holder against the Company or the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of such covenants against the Security Holder. 

  

 7. Severability. Each restriction and covenant in this Agreement contains an entirely independent restriction or covenant. While the restrictions aforesaid in this Agreement are considered by the parties to be reasonable in all the circumstances, it is agreed that if any restriction shall be adjudged to be void or ineffective for whatever reason but would be adjudged to be valid and effective if part of the wording thereof were deleted the said restrictions shall apply with such modifications as may be necessary to make them valid and effective. 

  

 8. Notices. A notice under this Agreement shall only be effective if it is in writing. Faxes are permitted. Notices under this Agreement shall be sent to the addresses set forth below, provided that a Person named below may change its notice details on giving notice to the other Person named below of the change in accordance with this clause (which notice shall only be effective on the day falling five clear Business Days after the notification has been received or such later date as may be specified in the notice). Any notice given under this Agreement shall, in the absence of earlier receipt, be deemed to have been duly given as follows: (a) if delivered 

   ##### 

  

 

personally, on delivery; (b) if sent by first class post, three clear Business
Days after the date of posting; and (c) if sent by facsimile, when
despatched. Any notice given under this Agreement outside Working Hours in
the place to which it is addressed shall be deemed not to have been given
until the start of the next period of Working Hours in such place.

article 5.1. such definition having the following wording:  
---|---|---

referred to as "Shares" in these articles of incorporation"_ ,  
      
    |   | and the replacement of the word "shares" by "Shares" throughout
the articles of incorporation where applicable.

    |   | "8.1 _None of the Shares now owned or hereafter acquired

    |   | Addition of new articles 8.8 to 8.11 that read as follows:  
   

   

 "8.8 _Permitted Transfers of Shares_. Any shareholder may transfer any or all of his, her or its respective Shares, without regard to the provisions of Articles 8.9 and 8.10 of this Article 8, only upon compliance with the following terms and conditions of this Article 8.8, _provided_ , that any transferee of such Shares shall remain subject to all provisions of this Article 8 binding on the transferor of such Shares: 

   

 Any shareholder may transfer any or all of his, her or its Shares: 

   

 (a) to the Company, 

   

 (b) to a child, spouse or parent of the shareholder making such transfer,  _provided_ , that any Shares transferred to such child, spouse or parent shall be held subject to the provisions of this Article 8, 

   

 (c) in favor of one or more family trusts established for the benefit of the shareholder making such transfer and/or his or her spouse and/or lineal descendents;  _provided_ , and only for so long as, either (A) such shareholder retains the sole voting control over the transferred Shares, in a trustee capacity or otherwise, or (B) if such shareholder dies, or becomes disabled, said shareholders spouse and/or lineal descendants retain sole voting control over the transferred Shares in a successor capacity, 

   

 (d) where any Shares are held by a body corporate, to (i) the shareholders of such body corporate on a distribution in kind or otherwise by such body corporate, or (ii) an Affiliate of such body corporate if the transferee gives an undertaking to the Company that if the transferee ceases to be an Affiliate of the transferor all its Shares will, before the cessation, be transferred to another Affiliate of the transferor. For the purposes of this Article, the expression "Affiliate" means, in respect of any person, a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified, where "control" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise, 

   

 (e) where any Shares are held by a partnership, to (i) one or more partners in such partnership, (ii) one or more persons who have retired from such partnership, 

   ##### 

  

    

or (iii) an Affiliate of such partnership if the transferee gives an
undertaking to the Company that if the transferee ceases to be an Affiliate
of the transferor all its Shares will, before the cessation, be transferred to
another Affiliate of the transferor; 

   

 (f) where any shares are held by a limited partnership, to (i) the partners of the limited partnership (or their nominees) on a distribution in kind or otherwise under the relevant partnership agreement, or (ii) an Affiliate of such limited partnership if the transferee gives an undertaking to the Company that if the transferee ceases to be an Affiliate of the transferor all its Shares will, before the cessation, be transferred to another Affiliate of the transferor; or 

   

 (g) upon or following the closing of a firmly underwritten public offering of Ordinary Shares at a per share public offering price (prior to underwriter commissions and expenses) equal to at least 75 per share and total gross offering proceeds to the Company in excess of 30,000,000, 

   

 (h) where the shareholder proposing to transfer Shares is not a Founder Shareholder (as defined in Article 8.9(e)), and is proposing (when taken together with any other transfers of Shares completed by such shareholder in the preceding 12 month period) to make a transfer of Shares constituting less than five per cent. (5%) of the issued share capital of the Company (calculated, in the case of the shares of Preferred Stock, on an as-if-converted into Ordinary Shares basis), or 

   

 (i) where the shareholder proposing to transfer Shares is a Founder Shareholder (as defined in Article 8.9(e)), and is proposing (when taken together with any other transfers of Shares completed by such Founder Shareholder in the preceding 12 month period) to make a transfer of Shares constituting less than half of one per cent. (0.5%) of the issued share capital of the Company (calculated, in the case of the shares of Preferred Stock, on an as-if-converted into Ordinary Shares basis). 

   

 8.9 _Tag Along Right_. 

  

 (a) _Rights of Tag Along_. Any shareholder, other than a Founder Shareholder (as defined in Article 8.9(e)), proposing to make a transfer of Shares constituting five per cent. (5%) or more, and any Founder Shareholder proposing to make a transfer of Shares constituting more than half of one per cent. (0.5%), of the issued share capital of the Company (in each case calculated, in the case of the shares of Preferred Stock, on an as-if-converted into Ordinary Shares basis), either singly or when taken together with any other transfers of Shares completed by such shareholder or Founder Shareholder in the preceding 12 month period, other than pursuant to Article 8.8 (the "Transferor"), shall deliver a written notice of the proposed transfer to the Board, following which the Board shall issue a written notice to each of the other shareholders (the "Transfer Notice"). The notice delivered by the Transferor to the Board and the Transfer Notice shall contain a description of the proposed transaction and the terms thereof, including (i) the number of Shares (calculated, in the case of the shares of Preferred Stock, on an as-if-converted into Ordinary Shares basis) to be transferred (the "Offered Shares"), (ii) the name of the proposed transferee, including, specifically, the name of each person to whom or in favor of whom the proposed transfer is to be made (the "Transferee"), (iii) the per share price at which the Offered Shares are proposed to be sold to the Transferee, calculated, in the case of the shares of Preferred Stock, on an as-if-converted into Ordinary Shares basis (the "Offered Price"), and (iv) the terms of payment of the Offered Price and the other terms and conditions to the proposed sale to the Transferee (the "Offered Terms and Conditions"). Each other shareholder (a "Tag Transferor") who notifies the Board and the Transferor in writing, which notice shall be irrevocable (a "Tag Notice"), within 20 calendar days (the "Tag Along Period") after receipt of the Transfer Notice, shall have the right (the "Tag Along Right") to sell a number of Shares (the "Pro Rata Entitlement") equal to the product of (i) the number of Offered Shares multiplied by (ii) a fraction (a) the numerator of which is the total number of Shares 

   ##### 

  

 

(calculated, in the case of the shares of Preferred Stock, on an as-if-
converted into Ordinary Shares basis) held by such Tag Transferor, and (b)
the denominator of which is the total number of issued Shares in the capital
of the Company (calculated, in the case of the shares of Preferred Stock, on
an as-if-converted into Ordinary Shares basis) to the Transferee at the
Offered Price and upon the Offered Terms and Conditions. In the event that
any of the other shareholders (the "Refusing Shareholders") do not serve a
Tag Notice on the Transferor and on the Board prior to the expiry of the Tag
Along Period, or if any Tag Transferor includes in its Tag Notice fewer Shares
than its Pro Rata Entitlement, the Board shall provide written notice thereof
to the Transferor and each of the Tag Transferors. Thereupon, the Transferor
and each Tag Transferor shall each have the right to sell to the Transferee
an additional number of Shares equal to the product of (i) the aggregate
of (a) the number of Shares (calculated, in the case of the shares of
Preferred Stock, on an as-if-converted into Ordinary Shares basis) that the
Refusing Shareholders would have been entitled to sell under this Article
8.9(a), and (b) the number of Shares (calculated, in the case of the shares
of Preferred Stock, on an as-if-converted into Ordinary Shares basis) that Tag
Transferors were entitled to, but did not elect to, transfer hereunder,
multiplied by (ii) a fraction (x) the numerator of which is the total number
of Shares (calculated, in the case of the shares of Preferred Stock, on an
as-if-converted into Ordinary Shares basis) held by the Transferor or
such Tag Transferor, as the case may be and (y) the denominator of which is
the total number of issued Shares in the capital of the Company (calculated,
in the case of the shares of Preferred Stock, on an as-if-converted into
Ordinary Shares basis) held by the Transferor and the Tag Transferors.
The Transferor shall assign so much of its interest in the agreement of sale
as each Tag Transferor shall be entitled to and shall request hereunder; the
number of Shares to be sold by the Transferor will be reduced by the
aggregate number of Shares to be sold by the Tag Transferors (in each
case calculated, in the case of the shares of Preferred Stock, on an as-if-
converted into Ordinary Shares basis); each Tag Transferor shall assume such
part of the obligations of the Transferor under such agreement as shall
relate to the sale of Shares by such Tag Transferor and the Transferor shall
not sell any Shares to the Transferee unless the Transferee concurrently
purchases the appropriate number of Shares from each Tag Transferor who has
exercised his, her or its right to sell under this Article 8.9(a). 

   

 (b) _Exercise of Tag Along Right_. Each of the Tag Transferors shall include in its Tag Notice the number of Shares which the Tag Transferor elects to transfer (the "Tag Transfer"), which number may not, without the consent of the Transferor, exceed the number of Shares such Tag Transferor is permitted to sell pursuant to the Tag Along Right. At the closing of the Tag Transfer, the Tag Transferor must provide for sale to the Transferee, free and clear of all liens and rights of third parties, the one or more certificates, in respect of a transfer of Shares in bearer form, and an instrument of transfer duly executed by the Tag Transferor and the corresponding Share certificate(s) (if any) in respect of a transfer of Shares in registered form, which represent or relates to, as appropriate, the number of Shares which the Tag Transferor elects to transfer pursuant to the exercise of its Tag Along Right. If, in the event of a transfer of Shares (whether in bearer or registered form), the certificate or certificates representing such Shares evidences a greater number of Shares than that elected to be transferred, the Tag Transferor shall deliver such certificate or certificates to the Board prior to the closing of the Tag Transfer with instructions for the Company to promptly re-issue new certificates in appropriate denominations properly to effect the Tag Transfer. The Tag Transferors shall make such representations and warranties regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective ownership of the Shares as the Transferor may be required to make to the Transferee,  _provided_ , that (i) each of the Tag Transferors respective liabilities for breach of such representations and warranties shall be limited to such Tag Transferors proceeds of the sale of its Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Tag Along Right, (ii) if any such Tag Transferor is not involved in the business of the Company, any representations or warranties that such Tag Transferor is required to make to the Transferee with respect to the business of the Company shall be limited to the best knowledge of such Tag Transferor, and (iii) if any Tag Transferor other than a Founding Shareholder (A) is not involved in the business of the company as an officer or director (either on its own or through a representative) and (B) does not hold in excess of five per cent. (5%) of the issued share capital of the Company (calculated, in the case of the shares of Preferred Stock, on an as-if-converted into Ordinary Shares basis and aggregating together all Shares held by the relevant Tag 

   ##### 

  

 

Transferor and its Affiliates (as defined in Article 8.8(d)), no
representations or warranties with respect to the business of the Company or
its subsidiaries shall be required of such Tag Transferor. 

   

 (c) _Waiver of Tag Along Right_. Each Tag Transferor who fails to notify the Transferor prior to the expiry of the Tag Along Period of its election to exercise its Tag Along Right, or elects to exercise its Tag Along Right in respect of fewer Shares than its Pro Rata Entitlement, shall be deemed to have waived its Tag Along Right (or portion thereof) only with respect to the transaction specified in the Transfer Notice. Such waiver shall not adversely affect that Tag Transferors rights to exercise its Tag Along Right with respect to future transfers of Shares by any shareholder. 

  

 (d) _Non-application of Tag Along Right._ The Tag Along Right shall not be exercisable in respect of any Shares issued upon the exercise of options granted under the Skype Technologies S.A. Stock Option Plan, and any certificates issued in respect of such Shares, and any further certificates issued in replacement of any thereof, shall be legended accordingly. 

  

 (e) Definition of " _Founder Shareholder"._ For the purposes of this Article 8.9, a "Founder Shareholder" shall mean any of: (i) Niklas Zennstrom, Janus Friis Degnbol and Felidae Limited; and (ii) any firm, company, joint venture, association or partnership that is directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controlled by any of Niklas Zennstrom, Janus Friis Degnbol or Felidae Limited, where "control" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such firm, company, joint venture, association or partnership, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and (iii) in respect of Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis Degnbol, their parents and grandparents (including step parents and step grandparents), wife or partner in a marriage-like relationship, child or grandchild (including any adopted child or stepchild or step grandchild) or a trust of which any of them is a beneficiary. 

  

 8.10 _Drag Along_. 

  

 (a) _Right of Drag Along_. Any shareholder or group of shareholders acting in concert holding Shares which constitute (calculated, in the case of the shares of Preferred Stock, on an as-if-converted into Ordinary Shares basis) in aggregate, more than fifty per cent. (50%) of the issued and outstanding Shares (calculated, in the case of the shares of Preferred Stock, on an as-if-converted into Ordinary Shares basis) who propose to make a transfer pursuant to terms negotiated bona fide at arms length of all their Shares (the "Selling Shareholder(s)") to a Transferee (other than to a transferee to whom Shares may be transferred pursuant to Article 8.8), shall have the right (the "Drag Along Right") to require each of the other shareholders (the "Called Shareholders") to transfer, subject to Article 8.10(f), to the Transferee all of the Shares owned by such Called Shareholders (the "Called Shares") at the Offered Price and upon the Offered Terms and Conditions. 

  

 (b) _Participation in Drag Along_. At the closing of the transfer of Called Shares (the "Drag Transfer"), the Called Shareholders who have received notice of the exercise of the Drag Along Right must provide for sale to the Transferee, free and clear of all liens and rights of third parties, the one or more certificates, in respect of a transfer of Shares in bearer form, and an instrument of transfer duly executed by the Called Shareholder and the corresponding Share certificate(s) (if any) in respect of a transfer of Shares in registered form, which represent or relates to, as appropriate, the Called Shares and the Transferee shall provide the Board with the consideration required to be paid. At the closing of the Drag Transfer the Company shall pay the Called Shareholders, on behalf of the Transferee, the price for their Called Shares. The Companys receipt for the price shall be a good discharge to the Transferee. The Company shall hold the price in trust for the Called Shareholders without any obligation to pay interest. If a Called Shareholder fails to deliver at the closing of the Drag Transfer certificates representing its Called Shares in respect of Shares held in bearer form or an instrument of transfer duly executed by the Called Shareholder and the corresponding Share certificate(s) (if any) in respect of Called Shares held in registered form, the 

   ##### 

  

 

Board may (and shall, if requested by the Transferee) authorise any Director
to transfer the Called Shares on behalf of the Called Shareholder to the
Transferee to the extent the Transferee has, by the closing of the Transfer,
put the Company in funds to pay the Offered Price for the Called Shares held
by the relevant Called Shareholder. A defaulting Called Shareholder shall
surrender to the Company its Share certificate(s) where its Called Shares are
held in bearer form and shall surrender a duly executed instrument of
transfer and any Share certificate(s) (if any) where its Called Shares are
held in registered form. On surrender of such certificate(s) and/or
instrument of transfer, as appropriate, such defaulting Called Shareholder
shall be entitled to the price for its Called Shares. The Called Shareholders
shall make such representations and warranties regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective ownership of the Called Shares as the
Selling Shareholder(s) may be required to make to the Transferee, _provided_
, that (i) each of the Called Shareholders respective liabilities for breach
of such representations and warranties shall be limited to such Called
Shareholders proceeds of the sale of its Shares pursuant to the exercise of
the Drag Along Right, (ii) if any such Called Shareholder is not involved in
the business of the Company, any representations or warranties that such
Called Shareholder is required to make to the Transferee with respect to the
business of the Company shall be limited to the best knowledge of such Called
Shareholder, and (iii) if any Called Shareholder other than a Founding
Shareholder (A) is not involved in the business of the company as an
officer or director (either on its own or through a representative) and (B)
does not hold in excess of five per cent. (5%) of the issued share capital of
the Company (calculated, in the case of the shares of Preferred Stock, on an
as-if-converted into Ordinary Shares basis and aggregating together all
Shares held by the Called Shareholder and its Affiliates (as defined in
Article 8.8(d)), no representations or warranties with respect to the
business of the Company or its subsidiaries shall be required of such Called
Shareholder. All parties to the transaction shall use their reasonable
endeavours to secure any approvals required to permit or enable the sale
and purchase of the Called Shares, to comply as soon as practicable with all
applicable laws and regulations and to execute such additional documents as
are otherwise necessary or appropriate in connection therewith. 

   

 (c) _Notice_. If the Drag Along Right is to be exercised, the Transfer Notice delivered pursuant to Article 8.9(a) shall state: (i) that the Selling Shareholders giving the Transfer Notice intend to exercise their rights pursuant to this Article 8.10; (ii) the date, between 7 and 14 days later on which the sale and purchase of the Called Shares will be completed, which shall be the same date as the date on which the sale and purchase of the Selling Shareholders Shares is completed; (iii) the Offered Price; and (iv) the Offered Terms and Conditions. 

  

 (d) _New Members._ If any person, following the issue of a notice pursuant to Article 8.9(a), becomes a shareholder in the Company pursuant to the exercise of a pre-existing option to acquire Shares (a "New Member"), a notice shall be deemed to have been served upon the New Member on the same terms as the previous notice, and the New Member shall thereupon be bound to sell and transfer all such Shares acquired by him to the Transferor or as the Transferor may direct and the provisions of this Article 8.10 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the New Member save that the completion of the transfer of the New Members Shares shall take place forthwith upon the notice being deemed served on the New Member. 

  

 (e) _Drag Along Right Priority._ The Tag Along Right shall not be exercisable with respect to a proposed transfer of Shares where the Drag Along Right is exercised with respect to that transfer. 

  

 (f) _Form of consideration._ The Drag Along Right shall only be exercisable if the relevant transfer will result in each Called Shareholder receiving a consideration comprising cash, cash equivalents, readily realisable securities or other consideration which will not result in: (a) any Called Shareholder incurring a liability to tax or (b) the level of the liability to tax of any Called Shareholder in respect of the receipt of such consideration being determined, in each case prior to such Called Shareholder actually receiving and being able to dispose of the consideration for the transfer of its Shares for value. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8.11 _Compliance with Law_  

 

The Company and the shareholders of the Company exercising the Tag Along Right
or the Drag Along Right under Article 8.9 and 8.10, respectively, shall
