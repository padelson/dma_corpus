the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any
fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6(e) and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d).

(d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the date hereof with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time of the First
Merger and no payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(e)

-4-  Certificates shall surrender such Certificates or Book Entry Shares in
accordance with this Section 1.7. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements,
following surrender of any such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest
(i) promptly after such surrender, the number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor along with payment in lieu of fractional

other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time of the First
Merger and theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time of the
First Merger and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If shares of Parent Common Stock are to be

Shares surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Certificates or Book Entry Shares so
surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Persons (as defined in Section 8.3(g)) requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer
or other Taxes (as defined in Section 2.6(a)(i)) required by reason of the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares surrendered, or
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated
by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Exchange Agent and Surviving
Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable
or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted
or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirements, and to
collect IRS Forms W-8 or W-9, as applicable, or similar information from the
recipients of payments hereunder. To the extent such amounts are so deducted
or withheld, the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
consideration would otherwise have been paid.

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, Surviving Entity or any party hereto shall be
liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock
for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration,
and any cash payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to Section
1.6(e) or any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of such
Certificate pursuant to Section 1.7(d) would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 2.3(c)),

of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, become the property of Surviving Entity, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares nine
months after the Effective Time of the First Merger shall, at the request of
Surviving Entity, be delivered to Surviving Entity or otherwise according to
the instruction of Surviving Entity, and any holders of the Certificates or
Book Entry Shares who have not surrendered such Certificates or Book Entry
Shares in compliance with this Section 1.7 shall after such delivery to
Surviving Entity look only to Parent, as a general unsecured creditor, for
payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a),
cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(e) and any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d) with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

1.8 _No Further Transfers of Company Common Stock_. All shares of Parent
Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including the Merger Cash
Consideration and any cash or dividends or other distributions paid in
respect thereof pursuant to Sections 1.6(e) and 1.7(d)) shall be deemed to
have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all

 



 

-5-  rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and from and after
the Effective Time of the First Merger, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the First Merger. If, after the
Effective Time of the First Merger, Certificates or Book Entry Shares are
presented to Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article I.

1.9 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent
Common Stock and Merger Cash Consideration, cash for fractional shares, if
any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6(e) and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Company or the
Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 

1.10 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the
Transaction shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulations sections 1.368-1(c)
and 1.368-2(g).

 

1.11 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time of the First Merger for which the holder thereof (i) has not voted in
favor of the First Merger or consented to it in writing and (ii) has demanded
the appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and has complied in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 1.6(a). At the Effective Time of the First Merger,
(x) all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist and (y) the
holder or holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such rights
as may be granted to them under Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262").

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.11, if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal rights
(through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then that
holders shares (i) shall no longer be deemed to be Dissenting Shares
and (ii) shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically at the
Effective Time of the First Merger into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate
formerly representing such shares in accordance with Section 1.6(a). In such
event, if the Exchange Fund shall then remain in place, Parent shall promptly
deposit or cause Surviving Entity to deposit in the Exchange Fund the
aggregate amount of Merger Consideration in respect of such Dissenting
Shares.

(c) Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
of any shares of Company Common Stock, the withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instrument served on Company under the provisions of Section 262 and
(ii) the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Company shall not offer
or agree to make or make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal
or offer to settle or settle any such demands without the prior written
consent of Parent. 

1.12 _Effect on Membership Interests._ By virtue of the Second Merger and
without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub II or Surviving
Entity I, (i) each membership interest of Merger Sub II outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Second Merger shall remain
outstanding and each certificate therefor shall continue to evidence one
membership interest of Surviving Entity and (ii) each share of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
of the Second Merger shall be converted into one membership interest of
Surviving Entity.

1.13 _Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time of the Second Merger,
the officers and directors of Surviving Entity will be authorized to execute
and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Company and Merger



 

-6-  Subs, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and
do, in the name and on behalf of Company and Merger Subs, any other actions
and things necessary or advisable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in Surviving Entity any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by
Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with, the Transaction.

Option was granted, (6) the applicable vesting schedule, and the extent to
which such Company Option was vested and exercisable as of the Reference Date,

Common Stock subject to issuance under the applicable Company Benefit Plans,

Contract. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 2.2 and in Section
2.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of the Reference Date, there is
no condition or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to give rise
to or provide a basis for the assertion of a claim by any Person to the effect
that such Person is entitled to acquire or receive any shares of capital stock
or other securities of Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) _Legal Requirements; No Repurchase or Disposition Obligations_. All
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, all outstanding Company Options,
all outstanding Company Restricted Stock, all outstanding Company Restricted
Stock Units, and all outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary of
Company have been issued and granted in material compliance with (i) all
applicable securities laws and all other applicable Legal Requirements and

respect to shares of the capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests
in, Company or any of its Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, "Legal

unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Companys assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements of Company and its
Subsidiaries. Company has delivered or made available to Parent accurate and
complete copies of all written descriptions of, and all policies, manuals and
other documents promulgating, such internal accounting controls. Companys

Subsidiaries.

true, complete and correct list of each Company Benefit Plan and each Company
Employee Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 2.12(b) of the Company

Plan or Company Employee Agreement or to modify any Company Benefit Plan or

Employee Agreement to any applicable Legal Requirements, or as required by
this Agreement) that would reasonably be expected to result in material
liability to Company and its ERISA Affiliates, taken as a whole.

the Knowledge of Company, there exists no condition or set of circumstances,
in connection with which Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates would be
subject to any liability under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Legal
Requirement material to Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(ii) Each Company Benefit Plan has been, in all material respects,
administered and operated in accordance with its terms, with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable material Legal
Requirements and the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements.
Each Company Benefit Plan, including any material amendments thereto, that is
capable of approval by, and/or registration for and/or qualification for
special tax status with, the appropriate taxation, social security and/or
supervisory authorities in the relevant country, state, territory or the like
(each, an "Approval") has received such Approval or there remains a period of
time in which to obtain such Approval retroactive to the date of any material
amendment that has not previously received such Approval, except for the lack
of such Approvals that, individually or in the aggregate, has not resulted in
and would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability to
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For purposes of clarification,
each Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code and each trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code is so
qualified and has either received and is entitled to rely upon a favorable
determination letter or opinion letter from the IRS with respect to such
Company Benefit Plan as to its qualified status under the Code, and, to the
Knowledge of Company, nothing has occurred that could reasonably expected to
adversely affect such determination or opinion. All amendments required to
maintain each such Company Benefit Plans compliance with applicable law,
including the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and
subsequent legislation or administrative requirements which have subsequently
become effective through the date hereof, have been timely adopted and
implemented. Except as required by Legal Requirements, no condition exists
that would prevent Company from terminating or amending any Company
Benefit Plan at any time for any reason without material liability to Company
and its ERISA Affiliates, taken as a whole (other than ordinary administration
expenses or routine claims for benefits).

 

(iii) No material written representation or commitment with respect to any
material aspect of any Company Benefit Plan has been made to a Company
Employee by an authorized Company Employee that is not materially in
accordance with the written or otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of
such Company Benefit Plans that would reasonably be expected to result
in material liability to Company and its ERISA Affiliates, taken as a whole.
Except as set forth in Section 2.12(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any Contract,
arrangement or understanding, whether written or oral, with any trade union,
works council or other Company Employee representative body or any material
number or category of its Company Employees that would prevent, restrict or
materially impede the implementation of any lay-off, redundancy, severance or
similar program within its or their respective workforces (or any part of
them).



 

-22- (iv) There are no unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or
in connection with, any Company Benefit Plan (other than routine undisputed
claims for benefits), and no action, legal or otherwise, has been commenced
or, to the Knowledge of Company, is threatened or reasonably anticipated
(other than routine claims for benefits), with respect to any material claim,
which would reasonably be expected to result in material liability to Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. With respect to each Company Benefit
Plan, (i) Company has not incurred any material liability in connection with
a non-exempt "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 406 of ERISA; (ii) there are no audits, inquiries or
proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Company, threatened by any
governmental authority with respect to any Company Benefit Plan; (iii) no
matters are currently pending with respect to any Company Benefit Plan under
the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System maintained by the IRS or any
similar program maintained by any other Government Authority; and (iii) there
has been no breach of fiduciary duty (including violations under Part 4 of
Title I of ERISA) which has resulted or could reasonably be expected to
result in material liability to Company, any ERISA Affiliate thereof, or any
of their respective employees.

 

(e) _Plan Funding_. With respect to Company Benefit Plans, there are no
material benefit obligations for which required contributions have not been
made or accrued to the extent required by GAAP and there are no material
benefit obligations which have not been accounted for by reserves, or
otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with the requirements of GAAP, on
the Company Financials. The assets of each Company Benefit Plan that is funded
are reported at their fair market value on the books and records of such
Company Benefit Plan.

 

(f) _Status of Plans_. No Company Benefit Plan is, and neither Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate thereof currently maintains, contributes to or participates
in, nor does Company or any ERISA Affiliate thereof have any obligation to
maintain, contribute to or otherwise participate in, or have any liability or
other obligation (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) under,
any (i) "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA),
(ii) "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the
Code), (iii) "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within the meaning of
Section 3(40) of ERISA), or (iv) plan that is subject to the provisions of
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No Company Benefit Plan
is maintained through a human resources and benefits outsourcing entity,
professional employer organization, or other similar vendor or provider. No
Company Benefit Plan provides health benefits that are not fully insured
through an insurance contract (with the exception of any medical expense
reimbursement arrangements subject to Sections 105 and 125 of the Code).

 

(g) _Continuation Coverage_. Except as set forth in Section 2.12(g) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no Company Benefit Plan provides post-
termination or retiree welfare benefits (whether or not insured) with respect
to any Person for any reason other than coverage mandated by applicable Legal
Requirements, and neither Company nor any ERISA Affiliate thereof has ever
represented, promised or contracted to any Company Employee (either
individually or to Company Employees as a group) or any other Person that such
Company Employee(s) or other Person would be provided with post-termination
or retiree welfare benefits, except to the extent required by applicable
Legal Requirements or, individually or in the aggregate, as has not resulted
or would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability to Company
and its ERISA Affiliates, taken as a whole.

(h) _Effect of Transaction_. Except as set forth in Section 2.12(h) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an
event under any Company Benefit Plan or Company Employee Agreement that will
or may result in any material payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration of any material payment, forgiveness of material indebtedness,
vesting, distribution, material increase in benefits or obligation to fund
benefits with respect to any Company Employee.

(i) _Section 409A_. Except as set forth in Section 2.12(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, each Company Benefit Plan, Company Employee Agreement, or
other Contract, plan, program,

plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated
in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code, its Treasury
regulations, and any administrative guidance relating thereto; and no
additional tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code has been or is
reasonably expected to be incurred by a participant in any such Company
Benefit Plan, Company Employee Agreement, or other Contract, plan, program,
agreement, or arrangement. Except as set forth in Section 2.12(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, neither Company nor any ERISA Affiliate thereof
is a party to, or otherwise obligated under, any contract, agreement, plan or
arrangement that provides for the gross-up of taxes imposed by Section

was less than the fair market value of the underlying equity as of the date
such Company Option or other right was granted, (ii) has any feature for the
deferral of compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income
until the later of exercise of disposition of such stock Company Option or
right, or (iii) has been granted after December 31, 2004, with respect to any
class of stock of Company that is not "service recipient stock" (within the
meaning of applicable regulations under Section 409A of the Code).

 

(j) _Stock Option Grant Practices_. Companys stock option grant practices (i)
comply with all applicable Company Stock Plans, stock exchange rules and
applicable Legal Requirements, except for any such failure to comply,
individually or in the aggregate, that have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (ii) have been fairly presented in
accordance with GAAP in the Company Financials. All outstanding stock options
have exercise prices that correspond to the fair market value on the date that
the grants were actually authorized under applicable Legal Requirements, in

ownership, leasing, use, development, occupancy or operation of any such real
property. Neither Company nor any Subsidiary thereof has received any written
notice from any insurance company of any defects or inadequacies in any
Company Leased Property or any part thereof that would reasonably be expected
to materially and adversely affect the insurability of such property or the
premiums for the insurance thereof, nor has any written notice been given by
any insurer of any such property requesting the performance of any repairs,
alterations or other work with which compliance has not been made. There are

party or parties (other than Company or any of its Subsidiaries) the right of
use or occupancy of any portion of the Company Leased Property.



 

-25- (c) _Valid Title_. Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good and valid
title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold

the outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent and all shares of capital
stock of Parent that may be issued as contemplated or permitted by this
Agreement are duly authorized and are or will be, when issued, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to any preemptive rights, rights
of repurchase or forfeiture, right of participation, right of maintenance or
any similar right.

Stock Unit" shall mean all restricted stock units and rights to receive shares
of Parent Common Stock or an amount in cash measured by the value of a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

-32- (c) _Stock Options_. As of the close of business on the Reference Date: (i)
5,605,165 shares of Parent Common Stock were subject to issuance pursuant to

under the applicable Parent Benefit Plans (as defined in Section
3.12(a)(i)) that are stock plans as set forth in Section 3.12(b) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule (the "Parent Stock Plans") (equity or other equity-
based awards, whether payable in cash, shares or otherwise, granted under or
pursuant to the Parent Stock Plans, other than Parent Restricted Stock Units,
are referred to in this Agreement as "Parent Options") and (ii) 1,866,800
shares of Parent Common Stock are reserved for future issuance under the

Option is not less than the fair market value of a share of Parent Common
Stock on the applicable date of grant. As of the Reference Date, there are no

deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, or otherwise
granting Parent or any of its Subsidiaries the right to have a third party
issue, deliver or sell to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, additional
shares of capital stock or other voting securities of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or obligating Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant,
extend or enter into any such security, warrant, call, right or Contract.
There is no condition or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to
give rise to or provide a basis for the assertion of a claim by any Person to
the effect that such Person is entitled to acquire or receive any shares of
capital stock or other securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) _Legal Requirements; No Repurchase or Disposition Obligations_. All
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock, all outstanding Parent Options, all

material compliance with, except as determined in connection with Parents
voluntary stock option review described in the Parent SEC Reports, (i) all
applicable securities laws and all other applicable Legal Requirements and
(ii) all requirements set forth in applicable Contracts and no such issuance
or grant involved any "back-dating" or similar practices with respect to the
effective date of grant (whether intentionally or otherwise). Except for
shares subject to Parent Restricted Stock Units, as of the Reference Date,
there are not any outstanding Contracts of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to (A) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock
of, or other equity or voting interests in, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or (B) dispose of any shares of the capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, any of its Subsidiaries. Parent and its Subsidiaries

(a) _Authority_. Parent and each Merger Sub has all requisite corporate or
limited liability power and authority to enter into this Agreement and,
subject to obtaining the approval of Parents stockholders as set forth in

execution and delivery of this Agreement), and the approval by Parents
shareholders of the First Merger and the Share Issuance. The affirmative vote

any class or series of Parent capital stock or other securities necessary to
approve and consummate the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Share Issuance. There are no bonds, debentures, notes
or other indebtedness of Parent having the right to vote (or convertible into,

which stockholders of Parent may vote. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Subs and, assuming due execution
and delivery by Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent
and Merger Subs, enforceable against Parent and Merger Subs in accordance with
its terms, except that such enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception.

any other Subsidiary of Parent, (ii) subject to the approvals contemplated
in Section 5.2 and compliance with the requirements set forth in or disclosed

the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Reports, and (z) did not at the time

material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto as in effect as of the time of filing, (ii) was or will be

(iii) fairly presented or will fairly present, in all material respects, the

balance sheet of Parent as of December 31, 2009, contained in the Parent SEC
Reports is hereinafter referred to as the "Parent Balance Sheet." Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, has been a party to since
January 1, 2008, or has any commitment to become a party to, any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S K promulgated

not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and



 

-36- (vi) liabilities that have been disclosed in Section 3.4(c) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule.

(d) _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent maintains, and at all
times since April 1, 2008 has maintained, disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting, as such terms are defined in,
and as required by, Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act.
Parents disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
Parents management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC. Parent has delivered or made available to
Company accurate and complete copies of all written descriptions of, and all
policies, manuals and other documents promulgating, such disclosure controls
and procedures. Parent is, and has been at all times since June 17, 2008 in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing requirements
of Nasdaq and has not received any notice since that date asserting any non-
compliance with the listing requirements of Nasdaq. The principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of Parent have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
maintains, and at all times since April 1, 2008 has maintained, a system of
internal control over financial reporting, which is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements (including the Parent Financials) for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of
Parent and its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and the Board of Directors of Parent, and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Parents assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements of Parent and its
Subsidiaries. Parent has delivered or made available to Company accurate and
complete copies of all written descriptions of, and all policies, manuals and
other documents promulgating, such internal accounting controls. Parents
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parents system
of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2009, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective and Parents independent registered accountant has issued (and not
subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding
that Parent maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of March 31, 2009. Parents management is completing its assessment of the
effectiveness of Parents system of internal controls over financial reporting
in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, and Parent has no reason to believe
that upon completion of such assessment Parent will not be able to conclude
that such controls were effective and that Parents independent registered
accountant will not be able to issue an attestation report concluding that
Parent maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
March 31, 2010. To the Knowledge of Parent, since April 1, 2008, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (including any Parent Employee), nor
Parents independent auditors, has identified or been made aware of (A) any
significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting utilized by Parent and its
Subsidiaries, (B) any illegal act or fraud, whether or not material, that
involves Parents management or other Parent Employees, or (C) any claim or
allegation regarding any of the foregoing. In connection with the periods
covered by the Parent Financials, Parent has disclosed to Company all
deficiencies and weaknesses identified in writing by Parent or
Parents independent auditors (whether current or former) in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting utilized by Parent and
its Subsidiaries.

 

(e) _Sarbanes-Oxley Act; Nasdaq_. Parent is in compliance in all material
respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
(ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of
Nasdaq.



 

-37- (f) _Independent Auditors_. BDO Seidman, LLP, Parents auditors for the
fiscal years ended March 31, 2008 and 2009, was at all time during its
engagement by Parent, and Armanino McKenna LLP, Parents current auditors, is
and has been at all times since its engagement by Parent, (x) "independent"
with respect to Parent within the meaning of Regulation S-X promulgated by the
SEC and (y) to the Knowledge of Parent, in compliance with subsections (g)
through (l) of Section 10A of the Exchange Act (to the extent applicable) and
the related rules of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board. All non-audit services performed by Parents auditors for Parent or its
Subsidiaries that were required to be approved in accordance with Section 202
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act were so approved.

3.5 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since the date of the Parent
Balance Sheet, Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses only in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and, since such date through the date hereof, there has not been (i)
any change, event, circumstance, development or effect that individually or in
the aggregate has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (ii)
any other action or event that would have required the consent of Company
pursuant to Section 4.2 of this Agreement had such action or event occurred
after the date of this Agreement.

 

3.6 _Taxes_.

 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have properly filed on a timely basis
all material Tax Returns that they were required to file, and all such Tax
Returns were true, complete and correct in all material respects. Each of
Parent and its Subsidiaries has paid on a timely basis all material Taxes that
were due and payable. The most recent financial statements contained in the
Parent SEC Reports reflect an adequate reserve (in accordance with GAAP) for
all material Taxes payable by Parent and its Subsidiaries through the date of
such financial statements and all unpaid Taxes of Parent and each of
its Subsidiaries for all tax periods commencing after the date of such
financial statements arose in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice. No material deficiencies for any Taxes have been asserted or
assessed, or to the Knowledge of Parent, proposed, against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, and, except as set forth in Section 3.6(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has executed
any waiver of any statute of limitations on or extending the period for the
assessment or collection of any material Tax which waiver or extension remains
in effect.

 

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.6(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely paid or withheld with respect
to their employees (and paid over any amounts withheld to the appropriate
Taxing authority) all federal and state income taxes, Federal Insurance
Contribution Act, Federal Unemployment Tax Act and other similar Taxes
required to be paid or withheld and material to Parent and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

(c) No audit or other examination of any material Tax Return of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is in progress as of the date hereof, nor has Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries been notified in writing as of the date hereof of any
request for such an audit or other examination.

(d) Parent has made available (for this purpose in the Parent electronic data
room or otherwise) to Company copies of all material Tax Returns for Parent
and each of its Subsidiaries filed for all periods beginning April 1, 2006 or
later.

 

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of
stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code
(A) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement or (B) in a
distribution that otherwise constitutes part of a "plan" or "series of
related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) that
includes the First Merger and the Second Merger.

 

(f) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in or is currently
engaged in a "reportable transaction," as set forth in Treasury Regulations
section 1.6011-4(b), or any transaction that is the same as or substantially
similar to one of the types of transactions that the Internal Revenue Service
has determined to be a tax avoidance transaction and identified by notice,
regulation or other form of published guidance as a "listed transaction," as
set forth in Treasury Regulations section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

 



 

-38- (g) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or
has failed to take any action or has Knowledge of any fact, agreement, plan
or other circumstance that would cause the First Merger and the Second Merger
to fail to qualify as a reorganization with the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. 

(h) There is no Contract, plan or arrangement to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, including the provisions of this Agreement, covering
any employee, consultant or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
that, individually or collectively, would reasonably be expected to give rise
to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to
Sections 404 or 162(m) of the Code.

(i) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has any actual or
potential liability under Treasury Regulations section 1.1502-6 (or any
comparable or similar provision of federal, state, local or foreign law), as a
transferee or successor, pursuant to any contractual obligation, or otherwise
for any Taxes of any Person other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or
(B) is a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity, Tax sharing, Tax allocation
or similar agreement.

 

(j) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any payments, is
obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any Contract that could
obligate it to make any payments that may be treated as an "excess parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code, determined without regard to Section

protect all of the Parent IP. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing:

improvement or other rights, and no such employee or independent contractor

former employer or other Person concerning Intellectual Property or
confidentiality;

 

(iii) no funding, facilities or personnel of any Governmental Entity or any

Person who is not, as of the date of this Agreement, an employee or consultant

impairing (A) any business practices of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or (B) the conduct of business by Parent and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted.

 

(b) _Permits_. Parent and its Subsidiaries hold all Permits that are required
for the operation of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted, other than Permits the absence of which would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken 



 

-42-  as a whole (collectively, "Parent Permits" other than Parent Environmental
Permits (as defined in Section 3.14(c)), which are covered exclusively under
Section 3.14). No suspension or cancellation of any of Parent Permits is

Subsidiaries are, and have been at all times since January 1, 2008, in
compliance in all material respects with the terms of the Parent Permits.

thereunder or any similar Legal Requirement relating to bribery or improper
influence, except for any such violations that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

3.9  _Litigation_. There are no claims, suits, actions or proceedings pending
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries before any court, Governmental Entity, or any arbitrator (a) that
challenges, or that may have the effect of preventing, delaying, making
illegal or otherwise interfering with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or (b) that either individually or in the aggregate with
all claims, suits, actions or proceedings, have had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred, and no
claim, dispute or other condition or circumstance exists, that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to or serve as a reasonable basis for the
commencement of any claim or proceeding or the type described in clause "(a)"
or clause "(b)" of the first sentence of this Section 3.9.

-43-  severance, retention, stay bonus, consulting, relocation, repatriation,
expatriation, visa, work permit or other Contract between Parent or any ERISA
Affiliate and any Parent Employee, other than a current, former or retired
executive officer or director of Parent, that is material either individually
or in the aggregate with all such similar Contracts.

 

(b) _Schedule_. Section 3.12(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule contains a
true, complete and correct list of each Parent Benefit Plan, each Parent
Employee Agreement and each of Parents ERISA Affiliates. Neither Parent nor
any ERISA Affiliate has any plan or commitment to establish, adopt or enter
into any new Parent Benefit Plan or Parent Employee Agreement or to modify
any Parent Benefit Plan or Parent Employee Agreement (except to the extent
required by Legal Requirements or to conform any such Parent Benefit Plan or
Parent Employee Agreement to any applicable Legal Requirements, or
as required by this Agreement) that would reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to Parent and its ERISA Affiliates, taken as a whole.

 

(c) _Documents_. Parent has provided or made available to Parent correct and
complete copies of: (i) all documents embodying each Parent Benefit Plan and
each Parent Employee Agreement required to be disclosed pursuant to Section
3.12(b) above including all amendments thereto and all related trust
documents, administrative service agreements, group annuity contracts, group
insurance contracts, and policies pertaining to fiduciary liability insurance
covering the fiduciaries for each such Parent Benefit Plan; (ii) the most
recent annual actuarial valuations, if any, prepared for each Parent Benefit
Plan; (iii) the three most recent annual reports (Form Series 5500 and all
schedules and financial statements attached thereto), if any, required under
ERISA or the Code in connection with each Parent Benefit Plan; (iv) if any
Parent Benefit Plan is funded, the most recent annual and periodic accounting

determination, opinion, notification and advisory letters; (vii) all material
communications to any Parent Employee or Parent Employees relating to any
Parent Benefit Plan and any proposed Parent Benefit Plans, in each case,
relating to any amendments, terminations, establishments, increases or
decreases in benefits, acceleration of payments or vesting schedules or other
events which would result in any liability material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (viii) all material correspondence to or from
any governmental agency relating to any Parent Benefit Plan; and (ix) the
three most recent plan years discrimination tests for each Parent Benefit
Plan for which such tests are required.

(d) _Benefit Plan Compliance_.

 

(i) With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan, no event has occurred and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, there exists no condition or set of circumstances,
in connection with which Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates would be
subject to any liability under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Legal
Requirement material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(ii) Each Parent Benefit Plan has been, in all material respects, administered
and operated in accordance with its terms, with the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code and all other applicable material Legal Requirements and the
terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements. Each Parent Benefit
Plan, including any material amendments thereto, that is capable of Approval
has received such Approval or there remains a period of time in which to
obtain such Approval retroactive to the date of any material amendment that
has not previously received such Approval, except for the lack of such
Approvals that, individually or in the aggregate, has not resulted in and
would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability to Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For purposes of clarification,
each Parent Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code
and each trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code is so
qualified and has either received and is entitled to rely upon a favorable
determination letter or opinion letter from the IRS with respect to such
Parent Benefit Plan as to its qualified status under the Code, and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, nothing has occurred that could reasonably expected to
adversely affect such determination or opinion. All amendments required to
maintain each such Parent Benefit Plans compliance with applicable law,
including the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and
subsequent 



 

-44-  legislation or administrative requirements which have subsequently become
effective through the date hereof, have been timely adopted and implemented.
Except as required by Legal Requirements, no condition exists that would
prevent Parent from terminating or amending any Parent Benefit Plan at any
time for any reason without material liability to Parent and its ERISA
Affiliates, taken as a whole (other than ordinary administration expenses or
routine claims for benefits).

(iii) No material written representation or commitment with respect to
any material aspect of any Parent Benefit Plan has been made to a Parent
Employee by an authorized Parent Employee that is not materially in accordance
with the written or otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of such Parent
Benefit Plans that would reasonably be expected to result in material
liability to Parent and its ERISA Affiliates, taken as a whole. Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any Contract, arrangement or
understanding, whether written or oral, with any trade union, works council
or other Parent Employee representative body or any material number or
category of its Parent Employees that would prevent, restrict or materially
impede the implementation of any lay-off, redundancy, severance or similar
program within its or their respective workforces (or any part of them).

(iv) There are no unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in
connection with, any Parent Benefit Plan (other than routine undisputed claims
for benefits), and no action, legal or otherwise, has been commenced or, to
the Knowledge of Parent, is threatened or reasonably anticipated (other than
routine claims for benefits), with respect to any material claim, which would
reasonably be expected to result in material liability to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan, (i)
Parent has not incurred any material liability in connection with a non-exempt
"prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 406 of ERISA; (ii) there are no audits, inquiries or proceedings
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened by any governmental
authority with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan; (iii) no matters are
currently pending with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan under the Employee
Plans Compliance Resolution System maintained by the IRS or any similar
program maintained by any other Government Authority; and (iii) there has been
no breach of fiduciary duty (including violations under Part 4 of Title I of
ERISA) which has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to Parent, any ERISA Affiliate thereof, or any of their
respective employees.

 

(e) _Plan Funding_. With respect to Parent Benefit Plans, there are no
material benefit obligations for which required contributions have not been
made or accrued to the extent required by GAAP and there are no material
benefit obligations which have not been accounted for by reserves, or
otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with the requirements of GAAP, on
the Parent Financials. The assets of each Parent Benefit Plan that is funded
are reported at their fair market value on the books and records of such
Parent Benefit Plan.

 

(f) _Status of Plans_. No Parent Benefit Plan is, and neither Parent nor any
ERISA Affiliate thereof currently maintains, contributes to or participates
in, nor does Parent or any ERISA Affiliate thereof have any obligation to
maintain, contribute to or otherwise participate in, or have any liability or
other obligation (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) under,
any (i) "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA),
(ii) "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the
Code), (iii) "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within the meaning of
Section 3(40) of ERISA), or (iv) plan that is subject to the provisions of
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No Parent Benefit Plan is
maintained through a human resources and benefits outsourcing entity,
professional employer organization, or other similar vendor or provider. No
Parent Benefit Plan provides health benefits that are not fully insured
through an insurance contract (with the exception of any medical expense
reimbursement arrangements subject to Sections 105 and 125 of the Code).

(g) _Continuation Coverage_. Except as set forth in Section 3.12(g) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, no Parent Benefit Plan provides post-termination
or retiree welfare benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to any
Person for any reason other than coverage mandated by applicable Legal



 

-45-  Requirements, and neither Parent nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever
represented, promised or contracted to any Parent Employee (either
individually or to Parent Employees as a group) or any other Person that such
Parent Employee(s) or other Person would be provided with post-termination or
retiree welfare benefits, except to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements or, individually or in the aggregate, as has not resulted
or would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability to Parent
and its ERISA Affiliates, taken as a whole.

 

(h) _Effect of Transaction_. The execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone
or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an
event under any Parent Benefit Plan or Parent Employee Agreement that will or
may result in any material payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration of any material payment, forgiveness of material indebtedness,
vesting, distribution, material increase in benefits or obligation to fund
benefits with respect to any Parent Employee. No payment or benefit which will
or may be made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by Parent or any ERISA Affiliate thereof with respect to any Parent
Employee or any other "disqualified individual" (as defined in Code Section
280G and the regulations thereunder) will be characterized as a "parachute
payment," within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. There is no
Contract, plan or arrangement to which Parent or any ERISA Affiliate thereof
is a party or by which it is bound to compensate any Parent Employee for
excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code. There are no persons
who Parent reasonably believes are "disqualified individuals" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder) as determined as of the date hereof.

 

(i) _Section 409A_. Each Parent Benefit Plan, Parent Employee Agreement, or
other Contract, plan, program, agreement, or arrangement that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated in good faith compliance with
Section 409A of the Code, its Treasury regulations, and any administrative
guidance relating thereto; and no additional tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B)
of the Code has been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by a participant
in any such Parent Benefit Plan, Parent Employee Agreement, or other
Contract, plan, program, agreement, or arrangement. Neither Parent nor any
ERISA Affiliate thereof is a party to, or otherwise obligated under, any
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that provides for the gross-up of
taxes imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. Except as determined in
connection with Parents voluntary stock option review described in the Parent
SEC Reports, no Parent Option or other right to acquire Parent Common Stock or
other equity of Parent (i) has an exercise price that was less than the fair
market value of the underlying equity as of the date such Parent Option or
other right was granted, (ii) has any feature for the deferral of compensation
other than the deferral of recognition of income until the later of exercise
of disposition of such stock Parent Option or right, or (iii) has been granted
after December 31, 2004, with respect to any class of stock of Parent that is
not "service recipient stock" (within the meaning of applicable regulations
under Section 409A of the Code).

(j)  _Stock Option Grant Practices_. Parents stock option grant practices
(i) comply with all applicable Parent Stock Plans, stock exchange rules and
applicable Legal Requirements, except for any such failure to comply,
individually or in the aggregate, that have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole and (ii) have been fairly presented in accordance with GAAP
in the Parent Financials. Except as determined in connection with Parents
voluntary stock option review described in the Parent SEC Reports, all
outstanding stock options have exercise prices that correspond to the fair
market value on the date that the grants were actually authorized under
applicable Legal Requirements, in each case except for any such failures,
individually or in the aggregate, that have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no ongoing
internal review of any past or current stock option practice, and Parent is
not aware of the existence of any reports on any such reviews completed
since April 1, 2008.

(k) _Labor_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is presently a party
to, bound by, or has a duty to bargain for, any collective bargaining
agreement, trade union agreement, work council, employee representative
agreement, union contract, or information or consultation agreement, other
than national or industry-wide agreements, with respect to employees and no
collective bargaining agreement is being



 

-46-  negotiated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Parent,
there are no activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any
employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. There has not been any labor
dispute, strike or work stoppage against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or,
to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened or reasonably anticipated that would
reasonably be expected to materially interfere with the business activities
of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. None of Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives or employees has
committed any unfair labor practice in connection with the operation of
the respective businesses of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except,
individually or in the aggregate, as has not had and as would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. There are no actions, suits, claims, labor disputes or
grievances pending, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened or reasonably
anticipated relating to any labor, safety or discrimination matters involving
any employee, including charges of unfair labor practices or discrimination
complaints, that, if adversely determined, would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither Parent nor any of its

that remains unsatisfied and that is material to Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

compliance with all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules
and regulations respecting employment (including but not limited to the
classification of any Person as an employee or independent contractor),

3.13 _Title to Properties_.

 

(a) _Leases_. Section 3.13(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
list of all real property leases or other Contracts for the occupancy of real
property to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any
of them is bound as of the date hereof and all amendments, guaranties and
modifications thereof (each, a "Parent Lease"). Except as set forth in the
Parent Leases or as disclosed in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, no party has
a right to occupy any of the premises subject to a Parent Lease ("Parent
Leased Property") except for Parent or its Subsidiaries. Parent has made
available to Company a true, complete and correct copy of each Parent Lease.
All such Parent Leases are valid and in full force and effect against Parent
or any Subsidiary of Parent party thereto and, to the Knowledge of Parent,
each other party thereto, except that such enforceability may be subject to
the



 

-47-  Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and, with respect to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, under any of such leases, no rental payments are past due and
there is no existing default or event of default (or event which with notice
or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default), except, individually
or in the aggregate, as has not had and would not reasonable be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever owned any real
property.

 

(b) _Properties_. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened condemnation or eminent domain actions or proceedings, or any
special assessments or other activities of any public or quasi-public body
that are reasonably likely to materially adversely affect Parents leasehold
interest in Parent Leasehold Property. To the Knowledge of Parent, there are
no facts or conditions that would, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a material and adverse effect on the transferability, ability to finance,
ownership, leasing, use, development, occupancy or operation of any such real
property. Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary has received any written notice
from any insurance company of any defects or inadequacies in any Parent Leased
Property or any part thereof that would reasonably be expected to materially
and adversely affect the insurability of such property or the premiums for
the insurance thereof, nor has any written notice been given by any insurer of
any such property requesting the performance of any repairs, alterations or
other work with which compliance has not been made. There are no leases,
subleases, licenses or agreements, written or oral, granting to any party or
parties (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) the right of use or
occupancy of any portion of the Parent Leased Property.

(c) _Valid Title_. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has good and valid
title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold
interests in, all of its tangible properties and assets, real, personal and
mixed, used or held for use in its business that are material to Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, free and clear of any Liens, except for
(i) Liens imposed by law in respect of obligations not yet due that are owed
in respect of Taxes or (ii) Liens that are not material in character, amount
or extent, and that do not materially detract from the value, or materially
interfere with the present use, of the property subject thereto or affected
thereby.

3.14  _Environmental Matters_.

not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, no amount of any Hazardous Materials is

to the Knowledge of Parent, as a result of any actions of any third party or
otherwise, in, on or under any real property, including the land and the

its Subsidiaries currently owns, operates, occupies or leases. Neither Parent
nor any Subsidiary thereof has any liabilities or obligations arising from the

not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole ("Parent Environmental Permits"). No

pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened. Parent and
its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the terms of
the Parent Environmental Permits.



 

-48- (d) Except, individually or in the aggregate, as has not had and would

hereof other than those listed as an exhibit to Parents most recent Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

(c) _No Breach_. Each Parent Material Contract is valid and in full force and
effect and is enforceable in accordance with its terms except to the extent it
has previously expired in accordance with its terms and except as
enforceability may be subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of, or has
failed to perform any act that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both
would constitute a default under the provisions of, any Parent Material
Contract, and, since January 1, 2008, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice that it has breached, violated or
defaulted under, any of the terms or conditions of any Parent Material
Contract, in each case in such a manner as would permit any other party to
cancel or terminate any such Parent Material Contract, or would permit any
other party to seek damages or other remedies, for any or all of such
breaches, violations or defaults, except, individually or in the aggregate,
as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of
Parent, no third party has violated any provision of, or committed or failed
to perform any act that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both would
constitute a material default under the provisions of, any Parent Material
Contract. Parent has not received any notice or other communication from any

of Parent has there been an oral notice or communication to Parent, that such
customer or other party may cease dealing with or materially reduce its orders
from Parent or its Subsidiaries. 

3.16 _Insurance_. Parent maintains insurance policies covering Parent, its
Subsidiaries and their respective employees, properties or assets, including
policies of property, fire, workers compensation, products liability,
directors and officers liability and other casualty and liability insurance,
against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are customary for the
businesses in which Parent and its Subsidiaries are currently engaged. As of
the date hereof, such policies are in full force and effect, and, since
January 1, 2008, none of Parent or its Subsidiaries has received notice or
other communication of cancellation or invalidation, or refusal of any
coverage or rejection of any material claim under any insurance policy. There
is no existing default or event that, with the giving of notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default, by any insured thereunder, except,
individually or in the aggregate, as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. There is no pending workers compensation or other claim
under or based upon any insurance policy of Parent or its Subsidiaries
involving an amount in excess of $100,000 in any individual case or $500,000
in aggregate.

 

3.17 _Disclosure_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Subs for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading.
None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent

circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any time before

relating to Parent or any of its affiliates, officers or directors which is
required to be set

 



 

-51-  forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Parent shall promptly inform Company.

supplied by Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

shareholders of Parent approve the First Merger, including the Share
Issuance, the Charter Amendment and the Annual Meeting Matters; _provided_

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (e) subject to Sections
5.2 and 5.3, directed that the First Merger, including the Share Issuance, the
Charter Amendment, and the Annual Meeting Matters be submitted to Parents
shareholders at the Stockholders Meeting of Parent.

3.19 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. Parents Board of Directors has received
an opinion from Jefferies and Company, Inc. to the effect that, as of the date
of such opinion, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of
view, to Parent. A signed copy of such opinion will be provided to Company
solely for informational purposes as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof.

 

3.20 _Rights Plan_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has in effect a
stockholder rights plan or "poison pill." 

3.21 _Shell Company Status_. None of Parent and Merger Subs is a "shell

Effective Time of the First Merger, immediately available funds necessary to
consummate the First Merger in accordance with this Agreement.

3.23 _Privacy/Data Protection_.

make all disclosures to, and obtain all necessary consents from users,
customers and workers ( _i.e._ , employees, independent contractors and
temporary employees) of Parent and its Subsidiaries required by applicable law
relating to privacy and data security and (ii) file registrations as required
with the applicable data protection authority. Parent and its Subsidiaries
also have ensured that each of them has complied with any cross-border
limitation relating to the transfer of Personal Information. Parent and its
Subsidiaries have posted a privacy policy governing its use of data and
disclaimers of liability on their web sites, and have complied at all times in
all respects with such privacy policy, any public statements made by any of
them regarding its privacy practices and all other rules, policies and
procedures established from time to time by any of them with respect to
Personal Information. Such posted privacy policies cover all of the activities
in which Parent and its Subsidiaries are engaged including the placement of
cookies, the tracking of user activity on a website and the creation of
profiles of users; and Parent and its Subsidiaries comply with all requests
from users, customers and workers to opt-out of the collection, use or
disclosure of Personal Information as required by applicable law.

(b) There is no action or claim pending, asserted or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened or anticipated against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
alleging a violation of privacy, data protection, data security or
confidentiality obligations under any applicable Legal Requirements, and no
valid basis exists



 

-52-  for any such action or claim. The negotiation, execution and consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and any disclosure and/or
transfer of information, including Personal Information, in connection
therewith, will not breach or otherwise cause any violation of any such Legal
Requirements relating to privacy, data protection, data security or the
collection, use or maintenance of Personal Information relating to users,
customers or workers. With respect to all Personal Information gathered or
accessed in the course of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, Parent
and its Subsidiaries have at all times taken all reasonable measures
consistent with industry best practices to ensure that such data is protected
against loss and unauthorized access, use, modification, disclosure or other
misuse, and there has been no unauthorized access to or other misuse, either
suspected or actual, of such data.

3.24 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in Article II, and any certificate delivered by
Company in connection with Closing, Parent acknowledges and agrees that
neither Company nor any other Person on behalf of Company makes, nor has
Parent relied upon or otherwise been induced by, any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Company or with respect to any
other information provided to or made available to Parent in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereunder. Except as provided in Section
5.10, neither Company nor any other Person will have or be subject to any
liability or indemnification obligation to Parent or any other Person
resulting from the distribution to Parent, or Parents use of, any such
information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or
other material made available to Parent in certain data rooms or management
presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, unless any such information is expressly included in a

of Parent, the First Merger, the Share Issuance, the Charter Amendment and all
other matters to be submitted to Parents shareholders in connection with

and (b) Parent will prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement
in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus in
connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the First Merger. Each of
Parent and Company shall provide promptly to the other such information
concerning its business affairs and financial statements as, in the reasonable
judgment of the providing party or its counsel, may be required or appropriate
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration
Statement pursuant to this Section 5.1, or in any amendments or supplements
thereto, and shall cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with the
others counsel and auditors in the preparation and filing of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement. Each of Parent and
Company will respond to any comments from the SEC, will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to
keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the First Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of
Parent and Company will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff in connection with the filing of, or
amendments or supplements to, the Registration Statement and/or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Whenever Parent or Company becomes aware of the

of Parent and Company shall cooperate and provide the other (and its
counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment
or supplement to the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement/Prospectus
prior to filing such with the SEC, and will provide each other with a copy of
all such filings made with the SEC. Neither Parent nor Company shall make any
amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement

consider, in the case of Parent, the Share Issuance, the Charter Amendment,
and the Annual Meeting Matters, and, in the case of Company, adoption of this
Agreement (each, a "Stockholders Meeting") to be held as promptly as

adjourn or postpone its Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary (A) to
provide any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to its respective stockholders in advance of the vote on
the Share Issuance, the Charter Amendment and the Annual Meeting Matters (in
the case of Parent) or the adoption of this Agreement (in the case of
Company), (B) if as of the time for which the Stockholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there
are insufficient shares of capital stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to approve such matters thereat or to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of such Stockholders Meeting or (C) if additional time
is reasonably required to solicit proxies in favor of approval of the matters
to be voted upon at such Stockholders Meeting. Each of Parent and Company
shall ensure that its respective Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed,
convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by it in
connection with its Stockholders Meeting are solicited, in compliance with
the DGCL (in the case of Company) or the CCC (in the case of Parent), its
certificate of incorporation or articles of incorporation and bylaws, the
rules of Nasdaq and all other applicable Legal Requirements. The obligation
of Parent or Company, as the case may be, to call, give notice of, convene and
hold its Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this Section 5.2(a) shall
not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in

vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement at Companys Stockholders
Meeting, and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of Parent or Company nor any

hereto, the recommendation of its respective Board of Directors as set forth
in the preceding clauses.

Section 5.3(a), in the event that Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that its Board of Directors
has in good faith concluded (following consultation with outside legal counsel
and financial advisors) is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Offer (as defined in Section 5.3(g)(ii)), Company may then take any
or all of the following actions (but only (X) if Company has not materially
breached Section 5.3, (y) Companys Stockholders Meeting has not occurred
and (z) to the extent the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to
do so would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Legal Requirements):

(i) Furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Acquisition
Proposal, _provided_ that (A) at least two business days prior to furnishing
any such nonpublic information to such party, it gives Parent written notice
of its intention to furnish such nonpublic information and the identity of
the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal and a copy of all
written and electronic materials provided in connection with such Acquisition

 



 

-61-  Proposal, (B) it receives from the third party an executed confidentiality
agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all
nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such third party on
Companys behalf, the terms of which (including standstill provisions) are at
least as restrictive as the terms contained in the Non-Disclosure Agreement
(as defined in Section 5.4(a)), _provided_ that such agreement shall not
contain terms that prevent Company from complying with its obligations under
this Section 5.3, and (C) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic
information to such third party, it furnishes such nonpublic information to
Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so
furnished or made available); and

Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that at least two business days prior to
entering into negotiations with such third party, it gives Parent written
notice of Companys intention to enter into negotiations with such third
party.

(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.2(b), in response to the
receipt of a Superior Offer that has not been withdrawn, the Board of
Directors of Company may withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its
recommendation in favor of adoption of this Agreement in a manner adverse to
Parent, and in the case of a Superior Offer that is a tender or
exchange offer, recommend that its stockholders accept the tender or exchange
offer (any of the foregoing actions, whether by a Board of Directors or a
committee thereof, a "Change of Recommendation"), if all of the following
conditions in clauses (1) through (5) are met:

(1) Its Stockholders Meeting has not occurred;

 

(2) It shall have (A) provided Parent with written notice of its intention to
effect a Change of Recommendation (a "Change of Recommendation Notice") at
least three business days prior to effecting a Change of Recommendation that
relates to (i) a Superior Offer or (ii) any material change to the terms of a
Superior Offer to which a previous Change of Recommendation Notice applies,
which shall state expressly (I) that it has received a Superior Offer, (II)
the material terms and conditions of the Superior Offer and the identity of
the Person or group making the Superior Offer, and (III) that it intends to
effect a Change of Recommendation and the manner in which it intends to do so,
and (B) provided to Parent a copy of all materials and information delivered
or made available to the Person or group making the Superior Offer it has
received;

(3) Either (A) on or before the expiration of the three-business-day period
following the delivery to Parent of any Change of Recommendation Notice,
Parent does not make a written offer, which shall be binding and enforceable
against Parent and capable of acceptance by Company (a "Matching Bid"),
in response to such Superior Offer, or (B) following receipt of a Matching
Bid within the three business day period following the delivery to Parent of
any Change of Recommendation Notice, the Board of Directors of Company
determines in good faith (at a meeting of the Board of Directors of Company
at which it consults prior to such determination with outside legal counsel
and financial advisor) that after taking into account the Matching Bid, the
Superior Offer to which the Change of Recommendation Notice applies continues
to be a Superior Offer;

(4) Its Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, following
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior
Offer and after taking into consideration the Matching Bid, if any, the
failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation
would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Legal Requirements; and



 

-62- (5) It shall not have materially breached any of the provisions set forth in
Section 5.2 or this Section 5.3 (including Section 5.3(b)).

Proposal, or by any Change of Recommendation. Company shall not submit to the

this Agreement shall prohibit Company or its Board of Directors from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any other
disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board of Directors, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to make
such disclosure would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable
Legal Requirements; _provided, however,_ neither Company nor its Board
of Directors may make a Change of Recommendation except in accordance with

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the Person making
the Acquisition Proposal and the strategic and other benefits of

(d)  _No Modification of Representations and Warranties or Covenants_. No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation or notification
pursuant to this Section 5.4, Section 5.6 or Section 5.7 shall affect or be

Agreement, Parent and Company will consult with each other before issuing,

in the 



 

-64-  event that there has been a Superior Offer or Change of Recommendation

5.6 _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) _Regulatory Filings_. Each of Parent, Merger Subs and Company shall
coordinate and cooperate with one another and shall each use reasonable best
efforts to comply with, and shall each refrain from taking any action that

reasonable best efforts to promptly supply the other with any information
that may be required in order to effectuate any filings or applications
pursuant to Section 5.6(a). Except where prohibited by applicable Legal
Requirements, and subject to the Non-Disclosure Agreement and applicable
privileges, including the attorney-client privilege, each of Company and
Parent shall (i) consult with the other prior to taking a position with
respect to any such filing or application, (ii) permit the other to review
and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in

before making or submitting any of the foregoing to any Governmental Entity
by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with any investigations or
proceedings in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (including under any antitrust or fair trade Legal Requirement) and
(iii) coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging such information.
It is acknowledged and agreed that the parties hereto shall have, except where
prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, joint responsibility for
determining the strategy for dealing with any Governmental Entity with
responsibility for reviewing the Transaction with respect to antitrust or
competition issues. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, no party hereto
shall participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any such filings, applications, Briefings, investigation, proceeding or other
inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior notice of such
meeting. 

(c) _Notification_. Each of Parent, Merger Subs and Company will notify the
other promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any officials of
any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto
and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for
amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information
provided to comply in all material respects with, any Legal Requirements.

occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity
such amendment or supplement.

 

(d) _Reasonable best efforts_. Subject to the express provisions of Section
5.2 and Section 5.3 hereof and upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist 



 

-65-  and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the causing of the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI
to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and

of all steps and remedies as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim,
action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii)
the defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to
have any stay, temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction entered
by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (iv) the
execution or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Company
and its Board of Directors shall, if any takeover statute or similar Legal
Requirement is or becomes applicable to the Transaction, this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such Legal Requirement on the Transaction, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(e) _Limitation on Divestiture_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require
Parent or Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree to any
divestiture, by itself or any of its affiliates, of shares of capital stock or
of any business, assets or property of Parent or its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, or of Company or its Subsidiaries or affiliates, or the imposition
of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their
businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and
stock. Neither Parent nor Company shall take or agree to take any action
identified in the immediately preceding sentence without the prior written
consent of the other.

 

5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) _By Company_. Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming

Parent and Company will each use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any material consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its
Subsidiaries respective Contracts required to be obtained in connection with

neither this Section 5.8 nor any other provision of this Agreement shall
obligate Parent or Company to obtain any consents, waivers or approvals that
are conditioned upon any material payments or incurrence of other material
obligations by Parent, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.



 

-66- 5.9 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Stock Plans and Company Options_.

 

(i) For the purposes of this Section 5.9(a), the following terms have the
following meanings:

 

(1) A "Continuing Employee" shall mean each employee of Company or any
Subsidiary of Company who, as of immediately following the Effective Time of
the First Merger, continues his or her employment with Company or any
Subsidiary of Company or becomes at the Effective Time of the First Merger an
employee of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent. 

(2) An "In-the-Money Company Option" shall mean each Company Option with a per
share exercise price less than the sum of (x) the Merger Cash Consideration
plus (y) the value of the Merger Stock Consideration based on the volume-
weighted average price for a share of Parent Common Stock, rounded to the
nearest one-tenth of a cent, as reported on Nasdaq for the trading day
immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time of the First Merger
occurs.

 

(3) The "Stock Award Exchange Ratio" shall mean the sum of (x) the Merger
Stock Consideration plus (y) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the Merger
Cash Consideration, by (B) the volume-weighted average price for a share of
Parent Common Stock, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent, as reported
on Nasdaq for the trading day immediately prior to the day on which the
Effective Time of the First Merger occurs.

(4) An "Underwater or At-the-Money Company Option" shall mean each Company
Option with a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the sum of (x)
the Merger Cash Consideration plus (y) the value of the Merger
Stock Consideration based on the volume-weighted average price for a share of
Parent Common Stock, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent, as reported
on Nasdaq for the trading day immediately prior to the day on which the
Effective Time of the First Merger occurs.

(ii) At the Effective Time of the First Merger, neither (A) Companys
2000 Stock Option Plan (the "2000 Plan") nor (B) any then-outstanding Company
Option held by a Person that is not a Continuing Employee or any then-
outstanding Underwater or At-the-Money Company Option (irrespective of whether
such Underwater or At-the-Money Company Option is held by a Continuing
Employee) shall be assumed by Parent (the Company Options described in this
Section 5.9(a)(ii)(B) referred to herein as the "Terminating Options").
The exercisability and vesting of each then-outstanding Terminating Option
shall be accelerated in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plan
under which it was granted, effective as of the date required or prescribed
pursuant to the terms and conditions of such Company Stock Plan prior to the
Effective Time of the First Merger. The exercise or vesting of any Terminating
Option and any shares of Company Common Stock acquired upon the exercise
thereof resulting solely by application of this Section 5.9(a)(ii) shall be
conditioned upon the consummation of the First Merger. The 2000 Plan, and any
Terminating Options granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan that are not
exercised prior to the Effective Time of the First Merger, shall terminate
and cease to be outstanding effective as of the Effective Time of the First
Merger.

(iii) At the Effective Time of the First Merger, each then-outstanding In-
the-Money Company Option that is held by a Continuing Employee, whether or not
exercisable at the Effective Time of the First Merger and regardless of the
respective exercise prices thereof (each, an "Assumed Option"), will be
assumed by Parent. Each Assumed Option will continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Option
(including any applicable stock option agreement or other document evidencing
such Company Option) immediately prior to the Effective Time of the First
Merger (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that
(i) each Assumed Option shall be converted into an option to acquire that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable 



 

-67-  upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
of the First Merger, and (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per
share exercise price of such Assumed Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the First Merger by (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Promptly following the Closing Date,
Parent will deliver to each Person who holds an Assumed Option a document
evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Company Option by Parent.

(iv) It is the intention of the Parties that the assumption by Parent of the
In-the-Money Company Options held by Continuing Employees pursuant hereto
satisfies the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.424-1 (to the
extent such options were incentive stock options) and of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) and the provisions of this Section 5.9(a) shall
be interpreted and applied consistent with such intention.

 

(v) Following the Effective Time, unless Parent provides otherwise, Parent
will assume Companys 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan") and be
able to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible by applicable Legal
Requirement and Nasdaq regulations, under the terms of the 2006 Plan or the
terms of another plan adopted by Parent to issue the reserved but unissued
shares of Company Common Stock under the 2006 Plan. The shares subject to the
unexercised portions of any award granted thereunder that expires, terminates
or is canceled, and shares of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to an
award that are reacquired by Parent pursuant to the terms of the award under
which such shares were issued that would otherwise return to the 2006 Plan
pursuant to its terms, will return and may be used for awards to be granted
under the 2006 Plan, except that (i) shares of Company Common Stock covered
by such awards will be shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) all references
to a number of shares of Company Common Stock will be (A) changed to reference
Parent Common Stock and (B) converted to a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
multiplied by the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall take any action that would otherwise preclude Parent from
being able to grant awards under the 2006 Plan, including adopting resolutions
to terminate the 2006 Plan.

 

(b) _Unvested Company Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time of the First
Merger, any shares of Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with Section
1.6(a) with respect to any unvested shares of Company Restricted Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the First Merger shall
remain subject to the same terms, restrictions and vesting schedule as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time of the First Merger, except to
the extent by their terms such unvested shares of Company Restricted Stock
vest at the Effective Time of the First Merger. Company shall not take or
permit any action that would accelerate vesting of any unvested shares,
except to the extent required by their terms as in effect on the date hereof.
Copies of the relevant agreements governing such Company Restricted Stock and
the vesting thereof have been provided to Parent. All outstanding rights that
Company may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time of the First Merger
to repurchase unvested shares of Company Restricted Stock shall be assigned to
Parent in the First Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon
the same terms and conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time of the First Merger, except that the shares purchasable pursuant to such
rights and the purchase price payable per share shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio.

(c) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time of the First
Merger, each Company Restricted Stock Unit then outstanding shall be assumed
by Parent (each, an "Assumed RSU"). Subject to, and in accordance with, the
terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and any applicable award or other
agreement, each Assumed RSU shall be converted into the right to receive the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (or an amount in respect thereof for
cash settled Company Restricted Stock Unit) equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Company Restricted Stock Unit multiplied
by the Stock Award Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole number of

 



 

-68-  shares of Parent Common Stock). Each Company Restricted Stock Unit shall
have the same terms and conditions as were in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the First Merger other than with respect to those Company
Restricted Stock Units listed (i) in Section 5.9(c)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule that were subject to performance based vesting conditions
prior to the date of this Agreement and that shall be deemed issued and
vested in their entirety at the Effective Time of the First Merger and
released from any forfeiture rights pertaining to such shares in favor of
Company, Parent or Surviving Entity, and (ii) in Section 5.9(c)(ii) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, which shall be deemed issued in their
entirety at the Effective Time of the First Merger, which shall be converted
into the right to receive Parent Common Stock according to the same formula
applied to the Assumed RSUs above, and which shall be subject to quarterly
vesting over a two-year period following the Effective Date in accordance with
the terms of the 2006 Plan. Except as set forth in this Section 5.9(c).
Company shall not take or permit any action that would accelerate vesting of
any Company Restricted Stock Unit, except to the extent required by the terms
of any such Company Restricted Stock Unit as in effect on the date hereof.
Copies of the relevant agreements governing such Company Restricted Stock
Unit and the vesting thereof have been provided to Parent. Except as set forth
in this Section 5.9(c), all outstanding rights that Company may hold
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the First Merger to the
forfeiture of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company
Restricted Stock Unit shall be assigned to Parent in the First Merger and
shall thereafter be held by Parent upon the same terms and conditions in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time of the First Merger, except
that the shares forfeitable pursuant to such rights shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect the Stock Award Exchange Ratio.

 

(d) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Promptly after the date hereof, Company
shall suspend the 2006 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP") so
that no new Offerings (as defined in the Company ESPP) shall commence and no
new participants shall enroll in the Company ESPP after the date hereof.
Company shall cause all outstanding Purchase Rights (as defined in the
Company ESPP) to be exercised within ten (10) business days prior to the
Effective Time of the First Merger and all Offerings to terminate thereafter,
as contemplated by the Company ESPP.

 

(e) _Further Steps_. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall provide notice
to each holder of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units and
Company Restricted Stock and to participants in the Company ESPP describing
the treatment of such Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units,
Company Restricted Stock and the Offerings then in effect under the Company
ESPP under this Section 5.9. Company shall take all steps necessary to cause
the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.9 to occur.

 

(f) _Benefit Plan Participation_. From and after the Effective Time of the
First Merger, Parent will, or will cause Surviving Entity to, recognize the
prior service with Company or its Subsidiaries of each employee of Company or
its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time of the First Merger (the "Company
Current Employees") in connection with all employee benefit plans, programs
or policies (including vacation) of Parent or its affiliates in which Company
Current Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time of
the First Merger, for purposes of eligibility and vesting. From and after the
Effective Time of the First Merger, Parent or Surviving Entity shall provide
Company Current Employees health and welfare benefits pursuant to employee
benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements maintained by Parent or
any Subsidiary of Parent providing coverage and benefits that are no less
favorable than those provided to employees of Parent in positions comparable
to positions held by Company Current Employees with Parent or its
Subsidiaries. From and after the Effective Time of the First Merger, Parent
will, or will cause Surviving Entity to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause any pre-existing condition limitations and eligibility waiting
periods (to the extent that such waiting periods would be inapplicable,
taking into account service with Company) under any group health plans of
Parent or its affiliates to be waived with respect to Company Current
Employees and their dependents and to recognize for purposes of annual
deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans,
deductible, co-pay, and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Company Current
Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time of the First Merger
occurs. The provisions contained in this Section 5.9(f) with respect to
Company Current Employees are included for the sole benefit of the respective
parties hereto and shall not create any right in any other Person, including,
without limitation, any Company Current Employees, former Company Employees,
any participant in any Company Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof or



 

-69-  any right to continued employment with Parent or Surviving Entity, nor shall
require Parent to provide, continue, or amend any particular employee benefits
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for
any Company Current Employee or former Company Employee. Subject to the
foregoing requirements, nothing herein shall limit the ability of Parent or
Surviving Entity to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or Parent
employee benefit plan, program, policy, or arrangement in accordance with
their terms and applicable law at any time.

 

(g) _Termination of 401(k) Plans_. Unless otherwise requested by Parent in
writing prior to the Effective Time of the First Merger, Company shall cause
to be adopted prior to the Closing Date resolutions of Companys Board of
Directors to cease all contributions to any and all 401(k) plans maintained or
sponsored by Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "401(k)
Plans"), and to terminate the 401(k) Plans, on the day preceding the Closing
Date. Immediately prior to such termination of the 401(k) Plans, Company shall
contribute to the 401(k) plans an amount in cash necessary to fulfill
Companys contractual obligations to match contributions by participants in
the 401(k) Plans accrued during the period commencing on January 1, 2010 and
ending as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. The form and substance of
the resolutions providing for the termination of the 401(k) Plans shall be
subject to the review and approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Company shall deliver to Parent an executed
copy of such resolutions as soon as practicable following their adoption by
Companys Board of Directors and shall fully comply with such resolutions.

 

(h) _Accrued Bonuses_ : In connection with determining bonuses payable to
Continuing Employees, Parent intends to take into consideration accrued
bonuses as of the Effective Time. In addition, Parent hereby agrees that, in
the event the employment of any Continuing Employee is terminated for any
reason prior to the date on which the first quarterly cash bonuses after the
Effective Time otherwise would be paid in accordance with Company Benefit
Plans in effect on the date of this Agreement, then Parent shall pay such
individual, concurrent with such termination, the amount he/she would be
entitled to receive if such individual remained an employee of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries through the end of the first calendar quarter after and
including the Effective Time and the scheduled date of payment as if such
Company Benefit Plan remained in full force and effect through and including
such dates.

5.10 _Indemnification._

 

(a) _Indemnity_. From and after the Effective Time of the First Merger, Parent
shall, and shall cause Surviving Entity to, jointly and severally, indemnify
and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time of the First Merger, a
director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor
entity (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that
the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time of the First Merger, according to the indemnification
provisions of Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect
on the date of this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time of the First
Merger, subject to applicable Legal Requirements, Parent shall, and shall
cause Surviving Entity to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations
of Company pursuant to any indemnification agreement existing prior to the
date hereof between Company and any Indemnified Party, true, complete and
correct copies of which have been provided to Parent prior to the date hereof.
The certificate of formation and limited liability company operating
agreement of Surviving Entity will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation, advancement of expenses and indemnification that are at least as
favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Company as in effect on the date hereof, which
provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
six years from the Effective Time of the First Merger in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of Indemnified Parties, unless
such modification is required by law.

 

(b) _Insurance_. For a period of six years after the Effective Time of the
First Merger, Parent shall cause Surviving Entity to maintain in effect
Companys current directors and officers liability



 

-70-  insurance (the "DandO Insurance") covering those Persons who are covered by
the DandO Insurance as of the date hereof, a true, complete and correct copy of
which has been provided to Parent, for events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time of the First Merger (including for acts or omissions occurring
in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herby, to the extent that such acts or omissions are covered by
the DandO Insurance) on terms and in amounts at least as favorable to such
Persons as provided in the DandO Insurance; _provided, however,_ that in no
event shall Surviving Entity be required to expend in any one year in excess
of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by Company for such coverage
(which Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in Section 5.10(b)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule) (and to the extent the annual premium
would exceed 200% of the annual premium currently paid by Company for such
coverage, Parent shall cause Surviving Entity to maintain the maximum amount
of coverage as is reasonably available for such 200% of such annual premium).
To the extent that a six year "tail" policy to extend Companys existing DandO
Insurance is available at or prior to the Closing such that the lump sum
payment for such coverage does not exceed 200% of the annual premium currently
paid by Company for such coverage, Company may, at its option, obtain such
"tail" policy. In the event that Company purchases such "tail" policy prior to
the Closing, Parent shall not take any action to cause the "tail" policy to
cease to be in full force and effect and such "tail" policy shall satisfy
Parents obligation under this Section 5.10.

 

(c) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Section 5.10 is intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their
heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and
Surviving Entity and its successors and assigns. In the event Parent or
Surviving Entity or its successor or assign (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of
Parent or Surviving Entity, as the case may be, honors the obligations set
forth with respect to Parent or Surviving Entity, as the case may be, in
this Section 5.10.

5.11 _Form S-8_. Parent agrees to file with the SEC, no later than ten
business days after the Closing Date, a registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor form) relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
with respect to assumed Company Options and issuable upon settlement of
Company Restricted Stock Units eligible for registration on Form S-8 and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement thereafter for so long as any of such options or
other rights remain outstanding.

 

5.12 _Treatment as Reorganization_.

 

(a) None of Parent, Merger Subs or Company shall, and they shall not permit
any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action (or fail to take any
action) prior to or following the Closing that would reasonably be expected to
cause the First Merger and the Second Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization with the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

(b) Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Code, each of Parent, Merger Subs and Company shall
report the First Merger, taken together with the Offer and the Second Merger,
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

(c) Parent, on its behalf and on behalf of Merger Subs, and Company shall
execute and deliver to each of Morrison and Foerster LLP, counsel to Parent and
Merger Subs ("MoFo"), and Cooley LLP, counsel to Company ("Cooley"), tax
representation letters in customary form at such time or times as reasonably
requested by each such law firm in connection with its delivery of the tax
opinions referred to in Section 6.1(f) and tax opinions satisfying the
requirements of Item 601 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities
Act. In rendering such opinions, each of such counsel shall be entitled to
rely on the tax representation letters referred to in this Section 5.12(c).

 

5.13 _Board of Directors._ On or prior to the Effective Time of the First
Merger, Parent will offer to two of the current directors of Company to elect
each of them to serve on Parents Board of Directors, such service to be



 

-71-  effective as of immediately following the Effective Time of the First Merger
and such service to be governed by Parents standard policies regarding its
board of directors, including its standard director compensation policy.
Parent will take all action necessary to cause the accepting Company
director(s) (the "Accepting Directors") to join the Board of Directors of
Parent in accordance with such offers. Parent agrees to cause the number of
directors that will comprise the full Board of Directors of Parent, effective
as of immediately following the Effective Time of the First Merger, to be
fixed at a number not to exceed eight (including the Accepting Directors).

5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time of the First Merger,
Parent and Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the
extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements) to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by Article I of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Company, and the acquisition of Parent Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) by each individual who is or
will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

5.15 _Merger Subs Compliance_. Parent shall cause Merger Subs to comply with
all of their obligations under or relating to this Agreement. Neither Merger
Sub shall engage in any business that is not in connection with the
Transaction and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

5.16 _Reservation of Parent Common Stock_. Effective at or prior to the
Effective Time of the First Merger, Parent shall reserve (free from
preemptive rights) out of its reserved but unissued shares of Parent Common
Stock, for the purposes of effecting the conversion of the issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement,
sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock to provide for such conversion as
well as the issuance of Parent Common Stock upon the exercise or settlement of
Company Options, Company Restricted Stock and Company Restricted Stock Units
assumed by Parent under Section 5.9.

-75- 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and expenses

due pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) to the date paid at the prime rate (as
announced by Citibank, N.A. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made. Payment of the fees described in this
Section 7.3(b) shall not relieve Company from any liability incurred in the

Section 7.2 hereof.

respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Transaction
by the stockholders of Parent and Company,  _provided_ , _however_ , after
such approval, no amendment shall be made which by applicable



 

-76-  Legal Requirements or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock
exchange requires further approval by such stockholders without such further

benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
