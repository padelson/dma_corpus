   AGREEMENT 

  



  

  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the 
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained  herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger  Sub and the Company
hereby agree as follows: 

  



  

   ARTICLE I 
   

  



  

   THE OFFER   

  



  

  Section 1.1 __The  Offer_._  

  



  

  (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been  terminated in
accordance with _Article VIII_ and no  event shall have occurred and be
continuing that, had the Offer  been commenced, would give rise to a right to
terminate the  Offer pursuant to any of the conditions set forth in 
_Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Offer  Conditions_ ") (other than the Minimum
Condition and  condition (b) on _Exhibit A_ hereto), Merger Sub  shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, use commercially  reasonable efforts to
commence (within the meaning of  Rule 14d-2  under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (including  the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the  " _Exchange Act_ ")) not later than three  (3) Business
Days following the date hereof (and in any  event Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,  commence not later than five (5) Business
Days following  the date hereof), an offer to purchase all outstanding
Common  Shares at the Offer Price. The obligations of Merger Sub, and of 
Parent to cause Merger Sub, to accept for payment and pay for  any Common
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be  subject to the satisfaction
or waiver by Merger Sub of the Offer  Conditions and the terms and conditions
hereof. Merger Sub  expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
waive  any Offer Condition, in whole or in part, at any time or from  time
to time, or to modify the terms or conditions of the Offer,  except that,
without the written consent of the Company, Merger  Sub shall not (i) reduce
the Offer Price, (ii) change  the form of consideration payable in the Offer
(other than by  adding consideration), (iii) reduce the number of Common 
Shares subject to the Offer, (iv) waive or change the  Minimum Condition (as
defined in _Exhibit A_),  (v) add to the Offer Conditions, (vi) extend the 
expiration of the Offer except as required or permitted by  _Section 1.1(b)_
or (vii) modify any Offer  Condition or any term of the Offer set forth in
this Agreement  in a manner adverse to the holders of Common Shares. Either 
Parent or Merger Sub may, in its sole and absolute discretion  and without
the consent of the Company, increase the Offer  Price, in which case the
Offer shall be extended, without the  consent of the Company, as required by
applicable Law. The  Company agrees that no Common Shares held by the Company
or any  of its Subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer. 

  



  

  (b) The Offer shall expire on the date that is twenty  (20) Business Days
(determined in accordance with  Rule 14d-1(g)(3)  under the Exchange Act)
after the commencement of the Offer,  except as may otherwise be required by
applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if at any scheduled 
expiration date of the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions shall  have been
satisfied or waived other than the Minimum Condition,  Merger Sub may, or if
requested by the Company, Merger Sub  shall, extend the Offer to the earliest
to occur of (i) a  date that is no more than fifteen (15) Business Days
after  such previously scheduled expiration date (the length of each  such
period to be determined by Merger Sub in its sole  discretion), or (ii) the
later of (A) three  (3) months from the date hereof or (B) such other date 
on or prior to the Merger Outside Date as Parent may specify in  its sole
discretion upon delivery of written notice to the  Company (the " _Offer
Outside Date_ ");  _provided_ _further_ , that Merger Sub may, in its sole 
discretion, (A) extend the Offer for a period of no more  than 15 (fifteen)
Business Days in the aggregate, if at any time  at or prior to any scheduled
expiration date of the Offer, less  than 78.75% of the number of Common
Shares then outstanding less  the number of Support Agreement Shares (if any)
held in a voting  trust in accordance with a Support Agreement, have been
validly  tendered and not withdrawn  and/or  (B) provide a subsequent
offering period (a  " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") after the  expiration
of the Offer, in accordance with  Rule 14d-11  under the Exchange Act. If
(1) as of any scheduled  expiration date of the Offer (x) all of the Offer 
Conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived, (y) no  further
extensions or re-extensions of the Offer are required  pursuant to this
_Section 1.1(b)_ and (z) Merger  Sub shall elect by delivery of a written
notice to the Company,  or (2) all of the Offer Conditions shall not have
been  satisfied or waived as of the Offer Outside Date, then, in each  case
of _clauses (1)_ and _(2)_ , the Offer shall  terminate. The termination of
the Offer pursuant to the  immediately preceding sentence is referred to
herein as the  " _Offer Termination_." If the Offer is terminated  or
withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  Agreement is terminated by Parent in accordance with  _Section 8.1_,
Merger Sub shall promptly return, and  shall cause any depository acting on
behalf of Merger Sub to  return, all tendered Common Shares to the registered
holders  thereof to the extent required by the terms of the Offer. 

  



  

  (c) Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement  and the
satisfaction of all of the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub  will accept for
payment and pay for all Common Shares validly  tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon  as practicable after the expiration
date thereof (as the same  may be extended or required to be extended) or (in
the case of  any Common Shares tendered during any Subsequent Offering 
Period) as soon as practicable following the valid tender  thereof. 

  



  

  Section 1.2 __Offer  Documents_._ As promptly as reasonably  practicable
on the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and  Merger Sub shall (a)
file a combined Tender Offer Statement  and  Schedule 13E-3  under cover of
Schedule TO (together with all amendments  and supplements thereto, the  "
_Schedule TO_") with respect to the Offer,  which shall contain or shall
incorporate by reference an offer  to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ")
and forms  of the related letter transmittal and form of summary 
advertisement (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and  such other
documents, together with all amendments and  supplements thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ ") and  (b) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
the  Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the extent  required by
applicable federal securities laws. The Company  shall promptly supply Parent
and Merger Sub in writing, for  inclusion in the Offer Documents, all
information concerning the  Company and its Subsidiaries and the Companys
stockholders  that may be required under the Exchange Act or reasonably 
requested in connection with any action contemplated by this  _Section 1.2_
to be included in the Offer Documents.  The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer  Documents of the Fairness Opinion and all other
material  disclosure relating to the Companys financial advisor  (including
the fees and other consideration that the  Companys financial advisor will
receive upon consummation  of the Offer and the Merger). Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the  Company agrees promptly to correct any information
provided by  it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that
such  information shall have become false or misleading in any  material
respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub further  agrees to take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents  as so corrected to be filed with the
SEC and to be disseminated  to the Companys stockholders, in each case as
and to the  extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The 
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity  to review
and comment on the Offer Documents and any amendments  thereto prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC and Parent  shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions,  deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its  counsel. In addition, Parent agrees to provide the Company and  its
counsel any written comments that Parent may receive from  the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents  promptly after the receipt of such
comments, and any written  responses thereto, and to promptly inform them of
any oral  comments or other communications. The Company and its counsel 
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment  upon any
written responses and to participate in any oral  responses and Parent shall
give due consideration to all  reasonable additions, deletions or changes, as
applicable,  suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. 

  



  

  Section 1.3 __Company  Actions_._  

  



  

  (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and to the  inclusion in the
Offer Documents of the Company Recommendation  (subject only to the Companys
right to rescind, modify or  withdraw the Company Recommendation in
accordance with the  provisions of _Section 6.2_). 

  



  

  (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of  filing by Parent
and Merger Sub of the Offer Documents, the  Company shall file with the SEC
and mail to the Companys  stockholders a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on  Schedule 14D-9  (such  Schedule 14D-9,  together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the  " _Schedule 14D-9_")  containing the
Company Recommendation and the Fairness Opinion,  and shall cause the 
Schedule 14D-9  to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders 
(concurrently with and in the same mailing envelope as the Offer  Documents)
as required by  Rule 14d-9  under the Exchange Act. Each of the Company,
Parent and Merger  Sub agrees promptly to correct any information provided by
it  for use in the  Schedule 14D-9  if and to the extent that such
information shall have become  false or misleading in any material respect,
and the Company  further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the 
Schedule 14D-9  as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated  to the Companys stockholders, in each case, as and to the 
extent required by applicable federal securities Law. Parent,  Merger Sub and
their counsel shall be given a reasonable  opportunity 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  to review and comment on the  Schedule 14D-9  and any amendments thereto
prior to the filing thereof with the  SEC and the Company shall give due
consideration to all  reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by  Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. In addition, the Company 
agrees to provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel any  written comments
that the Company or its counsel may receive  from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the  Schedule 14D-9  promptly after the receipt of such comments,
and any written  responses thereto, and to promptly inform them of any oral 
comments or other communications. Parent, Merger Sub and their  counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and  comment upon any written
responses and to participate in any  oral responses and the Company shall
give due consideration to  all reasonable additions, deletions or changes, as
applicable,  suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. 

  



  

  (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause  its transfer
agent promptly (but in any event not later than  three (3) Business Days
following the date hereof) to  furnish Parent and Merger Sub with mailing
labels, security  position listings, any non-objecting beneficial owner lists
and  any available listings or computer files containing the names  and
addresses of the record holders of Common Shares as of the  most recent
practicable date and shall furnish Parent and Merger  Sub with such
additional available information (including  periodic updates of such
information) and such other assistance  as Parent, Merger Sub or their agents
may reasonably request in  communicating the Offer to the record and
beneficial holders of  Common Shares. The Company shall, and shall cause its
directors,  officers, employees and other Representatives to, use their 
reasonable best efforts to make solicitations and  recommendations to the
holders of Common Shares for purposes of  causing the Minimum Condition to be
satisfied, including, upon  Parents request, together with Parent and Merger
Sub,  jointly preparing a presentation to RiskMetrics Group or such  other
proxy advisory firm as designated by Parent to recommend  this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby,  including the Offer and the Merger. 

  



  

  Section 1.4 __Directors_._  

  



  

  (a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, promptly  upon the
acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of Common Shares  pursuant to the Offer
representing at least such number of  Common Shares as shall satisfy the
Minimum Condition (the time  of such acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ "),
and  from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to  designate
such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole  number, to the
Company Board as is equal to the product of the  total number of directors on
the Company Board (determined after  giving effect to the directors elected
pursuant to this  sentence) multiplied by the percentage of the total number
of  outstanding Common Shares at such time represented by the  aggregate
number of Common Shares beneficially owned by Parent  or its Affiliates at
such time (including Shares so accepted for  payment) plus the aggregate
number of Support Agreement Shares  (if any) held in a voting trust in
accordance with a Support  Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall be  entitled to designate at least a majority of the directors on  the
Company Board as long as Parent, its Affiliates and the  stockholders party
to the Support Agreements beneficially own a  majority of the Shares of the
Company. In furtherance thereof,  the Company shall, upon request of Parent,
promptly take all  actions necessary to cause Parents designees to be so 
elected or appointed, including increasing the size of its Board  of
Directors  and/or  securing the resignations of one or more incumbent
directors  and/or  filling any vacancies so created with Parents
designees.  At such time, the Company shall, upon request of Parent, also 
promptly take all actions necessary to cause individuals  designated by
Parent to constitute at least the same percentage  (rounded up to the next
whole number) as is on the Company Board  of (i) each committee of the
Company Board, (ii) each  board of directors (or similar body) of each
Subsidiary of the  Company and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of
each  such board. The Company shall cause the foregoing actions to be 
effected concurrently with the Acceptance Time. 

  



  

  (b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents  designees to the
Company Board shall be subject to  Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and 
Rule 14f-1  thereunder. The Company shall promptly take, at its expense,
all  actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and  Rule 14f-1  in order
to fulfill its obligations under this  _Section 1.4_, including mailing to
stockholders  together with the  Schedule 14D-9  the information required
under Section 14(f) and  Rule 14f-1  as is necessary to enable Parents
designees to be elected  or appointed to the Company Board. Parent shall
supply to the  Company any information with respect to itself and its
officers,  directors and Affiliates to the extent required by  Section 14(f)
and  Rule 14f-1.  The provisions of this _Section 1.4_ are in addition  to
and shall not limit any rights that Parent, Merger Sub or any  of their
Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of  Shares as a matter of
applicable Law with respect to the  election of directors or otherwise. 

   
 ##### 

  

   



  

  (c) In the event that Parents designees are elected  or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to this  _Section 1.4_, then, until the Effective
Time, the  Company shall cause the Company Board to maintain at least two 
directors who are members of the Company Board on the date of  this Agreement
and who are independent for purposes of  Rule 10A-3  under the Exchange Act
(the " _Independent  Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if  the
number of Independent Directors is reduced below two for any  reason, the
remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled  to nominate an
individual or individuals to fill such vacancy  who shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of  this Agreement or, if no Independent
Directors then remain, the  other directors shall promptly (and in any event
within ten  (10) Business Days) designate two individuals to fill such 
vacancies who are independent for purposes of  Rule 10A-3  under the
Exchange Act, and such individuals shall be deemed to  be Independent
Directors for purposes of this Agreement;  _provided_ , that if no such
Independent Director is  appointed in such time period, Parent shall
designate such  Independent Director(s). The Company and the Company Board
shall  promptly take all action as may be necessary to comply with  their
obligations under this  _Section 1.4(c)_. Notwithstanding anything  in this
Agreement to the contrary, from and after the time, if  any, that Parents
designees pursuant to this  _Section 1.4_ constitute a majority of the
Company  Board and prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms 
hereof, any amendment or termination of this Agreement by the  Company
requiring action by the Company Board, any extension by  the Company of the
time for the performance of any of the  obligations or other acts of Parent
or Merger Sub or waiver of  any of the Companys rights hereunder, will
require the  concurrence of a majority of the Independent Directors (or in 
the case where there are two or fewer Independent Directors, the  concurrence
of one Independent Director), in each case, if such  amendment, termination,
extension or waiver would reasonably be  expected to have an adverse effect
on the rights of any holders  of Shares other than Parent or Merger Sub. 

  



  

  Section 1.5 __The  Top-Up  Option_._  

  



  

  (a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable  option (the 
" _Top-Up   Option_") to purchase that number of Common Shares (the  " _Top-
Up   Shares_") equal to the lowest number of Common Shares  that, when added
to the number of Common Shares held by Parent  and Merger Sub at the time of
such exercise, together with the  number of Support Agreement Shares (if any)
held in a voting  trust in accordance with a Support Agreement, shall
constitute  one share more than 90% of the total Common Shares then 
outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis and assuming  the issuance
of the  Top-Up  Shares), at a price per Common Share equal to the Offer
Price. 

  



  

  (b) The  Top-Up  Option shall be exercisable once in whole and not in
part on or  prior to the second (2nd) Business Day after the Acceptance
Time  or the expiration of any Subsequent Offering Period;  _provided,_
_however_ , that the obligation of the  Company to deliver the  Top-Up 
Shares is subject to the conditions that (i) no judgment,  injunction, order
or decree of any Governmental Entity shall  prohibit the exercise of the 
Top-Up  Option or the delivery of the  Top-Up  Shares in respect of such
exercise; (ii) the  Top-Up  Option shall not be exercisable for a number of
Common Shares in  excess of the number of authorized but unissued Common
Shares  (including as authorized and unissued Shares, for purposes of  this
_Section 1.5_, any Common Shares held in the  treasury of the Company); and
(iii) Merger Sub has accepted  for payment and paid for all Shares validly
tendered in the  Offer and not withdrawn; _provided_ _further_ , that  the
Top-Up  Option shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (A) the 
Effective Time and (B) the termination of this Agreement in  accordance with
its terms. The parties shall cooperate to ensure  that the issuance of the 
Top-Up  Shares is accomplished consistent with applicable Law, including 
compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the  Top-Up 
Shares under the Securities Act. 

  



  

  (c) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the  Top-Up  Option,
Merger Sub shall so notify the Company in writing, and  shall set forth in
such notice (i) the number of Common  Shares that will be owned by Parent and
Merger Sub immediately  preceding the purchase of the  Top-Up  Shares,
together with the number of Support Agreement Shares (if  any) held in a
voting trust in accordance with a Support  Agreement, and (ii) the place and
time for the closing of  the purchase of the  Top-Up  Shares (the  " _Top-
Up   Closing_" and the date of such closing,  " _Top-Up   Closing Date_"),
which shall take place not later than  two (2) Business Days following the
Acceptance Time or the  expiration of any Subsequent Offering Period. The
Company shall,  as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice (and
in  no event later than the  Top-Up  Closing Date), notify Parent and
Merger Sub in writing of the  number of Shares then outstanding and the
number of  Top-Up  Shares. At the  Top-Up  Closing, Merger Sub shall pay
the Company the aggregate price  required to be paid for the  Top-Up 
Shares and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a  certificate
representing the  Top-Up  Shares, which certificate may include any legends
required by  applicable 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  securities laws. The aggregate price required to be paid for the  Top-Up 
Shares shall be paid by Merger Sub or Parent by (A) paying  in cash, by wire
transfer of readily available funds, an amount  equal to not less than the
aggregate par value of the  Top-Up  Shares and (B) executing and delivering
to the Company a  promissory note (the " _Promissory Note_ ") having  a
principal amount equal to the aggregate cash purchase price  for the  Top-
Up  Shares less the amount paid in cash pursuant to clause (A). The 
Promissory Note shall bear interest at the rate of interest per  annum equal
to the prime lending rate prevailing from time to  time during such period as
published in The Wall Street Journal,  shall mature on the first anniversary
of the date of execution  and delivery of such promissory note and may be
prepaid without  premium or penalty. Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree
that  in any appraisal proceeding described in _Section 3.5_  hereof, that
the fair value of the Dissenting Shares subject to  the appraisal proceeding
shall be determined in accordance with  the DGCL without regard to the  Top-
Up  Option, the  Top-Up  Shares or the Promissory Note.

 ##### 

  

   



  

  (e) If at any time during the period between the date of  this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the  outstanding shares of capital

  (i) At the Acceptance Time, each option to purchase Common  Shares granted

whether vested or unvested, that is  outstanding immediately prior to the

shall pay to  each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option as
soon  as practicable following the Acceptance Time an amount in cash 
(without interest, and subject to deduction for any required  withholding
Tax) equal to the product of (i) the excess of  the Offer Price over the
exercise price per Common Share under  such Company Option and (ii) the
number of Common Shares  subject to such Company Option; _provided_ , that if
the  exercise price per Common Share of any such Company Option is  equal to
or greater than the Offer Price, such Company Option  shall be cancelled
without any cash payment being made in  respect thereof; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the  foregoing shall not apply to Company Options (if any)
held by  stockholders party to the Support Agreements to the extent  elected
by Parent in accordance with the terms of the Support  Agreements, which
Company Options shall be treated in accordance  with the terms thereof. 

  



  

  (ii) Each holder of an unvested award of restricted stock  granted under
the Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Company  Restricted Share_ ") shall have
the right to tender such  Company Restricted Share into the Offer, subject to
and  contingent upon the occurrence of the Acceptance Time. At the 
Acceptance Time, each such Company Restricted Share that is  tendered into
the Offer shall become fully vested and, to the  extent not withheld by the
Company to satisfy Tax withholding  obligations, shall be treated the same as
other Common Shares  properly tendered into the Offer. Each Company
Restricted Share  which is not so tendered into the Offer shall become
fully  vested at the Acceptance Time and, upon the Effective Time,  shall be
cancelled and converted into, and shall thereafter only  represent the right
to receive, the Per Share Merger  Consideration in accordance with _Section
3.1(a)_. 

  



  

  (b) __Corporate Action_._ At or prior  to the Acceptance Time, the
Company, the Company Board and the  compensation committee of the Company
Board, as applicable,  shall (i) adopt resolutions and take all such other
actions  reasonably required to implement the provisions of  _Section

or director stock option,  stock purchase or equity compensation plan,
arrangement or  agreement of the Company, including the Company Stock Plan

other rights in respect of, the capital stock of  the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their  Subsidiaries following the Effective Time,
except the right to  receive the payment contemplated by _Section 3.2(a)_ 
in cancellation and settlement thereof. 

  



  

  Section 3.3 __Exchange  and Payment_._  

  



  

  (a) At or immediately subsequent to the Effective Time,  Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with a bank or  trust company designated
by Parent (the " _Paying  Agent_ ") the cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to
pay  the aggregate amount of the payments due under  _Section 3.1(a)_ (such
cash being hereinafter referred  to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment
Fund  shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments  due
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, except as provided  in this Agreement. 

  



  

  (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective  Time (and in
any event not later than the third (3rd) Business  Day following the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation  shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of  (i) an outstanding certificate or
outstanding certificates  (" _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to
the  Effective Time represented outstanding Common Shares or  (ii)
uncertificated Common Shares represented by 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") which, in each  case, were converted
into the right to receive the Per Share  Merger Consideration with respect
thereto pursuant to  _Section 3.1(a)_, (A) a form of letter of  transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be  effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or  Book-Entry Shares held by such Person shall
pass, only upon  proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or,
in  the case of Book-Entry Shares, adherence to the procedures set  forth in
the letter of transmittal, and shall be in customary  form and contain such
other provisions as Parent or the Paying  Agent may reasonably specify) and
(B) instructions for use  in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or
effective  affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in 
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable with  respect thereto
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_. 

  



  

  (c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or effective  affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share to the  Paying Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly  completed and validly executed, and such other
documents as the  Paying Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such 
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in  exchange
therefor the Per Share Merger Consideration for each  Common Share formerly
represented by such Certificate (or  effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry  Share (subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax),  and such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall forthwith
be  cancelled. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash 
payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.  In the event
that the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be  paid to a Person other than
the Person in whose name any  Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment  that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed  or otherwise in proper form for transfer, that the signatures on 
such Certificate or any related stock power shall be properly  guaranteed and
that the Person requesting such payment shall pay  any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of such payment  to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate  or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent and the Paying Agent  that such Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. Until  surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.3_,  each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time  after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive  upon such surrender or
transfer the Per Share Merger  Consideration payable in respect of Common
Shares theretofore  represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares,
as  applicable, pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, without any  interest
thereon. 

  



  

  (d) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of  Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms  of this _Article III_ shall
be deemed to have been  paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Common  Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry 
Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the  Company shall
be closed and there shall be no further  registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the  Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective  Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or 
the Paying Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for  Book-Entry Shares,
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall  be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in, and subject to the  terms of, this _Article III_, subject to
applicable  Law in the case of Dissenting Shares. 

  



  

  (e) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the  Payment Fund
as directed by Parent, on a daily basis;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such investment or loss  thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of  Certificates of Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this  _Article III_. Any
interest or other income resulting  from such investments shall be paid to
Parent, upon demand. 

  



  

  (f) Any portion of the Payment Fund (and any interest or  other income
earned thereon) that remains undistributed to the  holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares six (6) months  after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to the Surviving  Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates
or  Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this  _Article
III_ shall thereafter look only to the  Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or  other similar Laws), as general creditors
thereof, for payment  of the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to
Common  Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry 
Share, without interest. 

  



  

  (g) None of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation,  the Paying
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any  Person in respect of cash
from the Payment Fund properly  delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable  abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates  or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been exchanged prior to
two  years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such  earlier
date on which the related Per Share Merger Consideration  would escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental  Entity), any such 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  Per Share Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the  extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the  Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest  of any Person
previously entitled thereto. 

  



  

  (h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or  destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit, in form and  substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, of that fact by the  Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed  and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by  such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying 
Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against  any claim
that may be made against it or the Surviving  Corporation with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent  will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed  Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration payable
in  respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  



  

  (i) Any portion of the aggregate Per Share Merger  Consideration made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to  _Section 3.1(a)_ to pay for Common
Shares for which  appraisal rights have been perfected as described in 
_Section 3.5_ shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. 

  



  

  (j) Any consideration payable in respect of the  Series B Preferred Shares
and the Series C Preferred  Shares pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ shall be
delivered  by the Surviving Corporation to the holders of such  Series B
Preferred Shares and Series C Preferred  Shares promptly after the Effective
Time upon surrender to the  Surviving Corporation of the certificates
representing such  shares. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any
cash  payable upon surrender of any such certificates. In the event  that
the consideration payable pursuant to  _Section 3.1(b)_ is to be paid to a
Person other than  the Person in whose name any such certificate is
registered, it  shall be a condition of payment that the certificate so 
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper  form for
transfer, that the signatures on such certificate or  any related stock power
shall be properly guaranteed and that  the Person requesting such payment
shall pay any transfer or  other Taxes required by reason of such payment to
a Person other  than the registered holder of such certificate or establish
to  the satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are  not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section 3.3_, each
certificate representing  Series B Preferred Shares or Series C Preferred
Shares  shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to  represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender or  transfer the consideration
payable pursuant to  _Section 3.1(b)_ in respect of the Series B  Preferred
Shares or Series C Preferred Shares theretofore  represented by such
certificate without any interest thereon. 

  



  

  Section 3.4 __Withholding  Rights_._ Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving 
Corporation, the Company and the Paying Agent shall be entitled  to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable  to any holder of
Shares or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement  such amounts as Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation,  the Company or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and  withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  " _Code_ "), or
any provision of state, local or  foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and  paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent,
Merger  Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or the Paying Agent, 
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this  Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which  such deduction and
withholding was made. 

  



  

  Section 3.5 __Dissenting  Shares_._ Notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and  outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are  held by a holder
thereof who has not voted in favor of the  Merger and who is entitled to
demand and validly demands payment  of the fair value for such Shares as
determined in accordance  with Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the  "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted  into or be exchangeable for
the right to receive the  consideration specified in _Sections 3.1(a)_ and 
_(b)_ , but instead shall be converted into the right to  receive payment
from the Surviving Corporation with respect to  such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the DGCL, unless and  until such holder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have  effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right
under the  DGCL. If any such holder of Shares shall have failed to perfect 
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each  Share of such
holder shall be treated as a Share that had been  converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the  consideration specified in
_Sections 3.1(a)_ and  _(b)_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent
of  any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of  Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or written  threats thereof, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any  other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by  the Company with respect stockholders rights of
appraisal  and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The  Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of  Parent, make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to  settle, any such demands, or agree to
do or commit to do any of  the foregoing.

therein (excluding, in each case, any  disclosures set forth (x) under the

information in a particular section or subsection of the Company  Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any  other section or
subsection of this Agreement to which the  relevance of such information is
reasonably apparent on its  face), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger  Sub as follows: 

  



  

  Section 4.1 __Organization,  Standing and Power_._  

  



  

  (a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) is an  entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing  under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization (with  respect to jurisdictions that
recognize such concept),  (ii) has all requisite corporate or similar power
and  authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry  on its
business as now being conducted and (iii) is duly  qualified or licensed to
do business and is in good standing  (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize such concept) in  each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the  ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes
such  qualification or licensing necessary, except in the case of  _clause
(iii)_ where the failure to be so qualified or  licensed or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate,  has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a  Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement,  " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means any event,  change,
development, circumstance, occurrence, effect, condition  or state of facts
that, individually or in the aggregate,  (A) is or would reasonably be
expected to be materially  adverse to the assets, liabilities, condition
(financial or  otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and its 
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) materially impairs  the ability of the
Company to consummate, or prevents or  materially delays, any of the other
transactions contemplated by  this Agreement or would reasonably be expected
to do so;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of  _clause (A)_ and
_clause (B)_, Material  Adverse Effect shall not include any event, change,
development,  circumstance, occurrence, effect, condition or state of facts
to  the extent resulting from (1) conditions generally  affecting the
entertainment industry, or the economy or the  financial or securities
markets, in the United States,  (2) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities
or acts of  war or terrorism (other than any of the foregoing that causes 
any damage or destruction to or renders physically unusable or  inaccessible
any facility or property of the Company or any of  its Subsidiaries), (3)
changes in Law or GAAP after the  date hereof, (4) actions of the Company or
any of its  Subsidiaries which Parent has expressly requested in writing or 
to which Parent expressly consents in writing (other than  pursuant to this
Agreement); and (5) resulting from the  announcement or performance of this
Agreement and the  transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood that
this  _clause (5)_ shall not apply to references to  "Material Adverse
Effect" set forth in  _Sections 4.5_, _4.12(c)(vii)_ , _4.12(e)_   and
_4.16(a)(xv)_ and, to the extent related to such  representations and
warranties, the conditions set forth in  _clause (c)(iv)_ of the Offer
Conditions and, if the  Offer Termination shall have occurred, the conditions
set forth  in _Section 7.2(a)_); _provided_ , that with  respect to _clauses
(1)_ , _(2)_ and ( _3)_ , the  impact of such event, change, development,
circumstances,  occurrence, effect, condition or state of facts is not 
disproportionately adverse to the Company and its Subsidiaries,  taken as a
whole, relative to similarly situated companies in  the entertainment
industry. 

  



  

  (b) The Company has previously delivered to Parent true and  complete
copies of the Companys certificate of  incorporation (the " _Company
Charter_ ") and  bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") and the  certificate of
incorporation 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of each of  its
significant Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the  date of this
Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full  force and effect. The Company
is not in violation of any  provision of the Company Charter or Company
Bylaws. The Company  has made available to Parent true and complete copies of
the  minutes (or, in the case of draft minutes, the most recent  drafts
thereof as of the date of this Agreement) of all meetings  of the Companys
stockholders, the Company Board and each  committee of the Company Board and
the minutes of meeting of the  stockholders and board of directors of each of
its Subsidiaries  held since January 1, 2008.

purchase option, call option, right  of first refusal, preemptive right,
subscription right or any  similar right under any provision of applicable
Law, the  organizational documents of such Subsidiary or any Contract to

on _Section 4.2(a) of the Company Disclosure  Letter_, all of the shares of
capital stock or other voting  securities or equity interests of each such
Subsidiary are  owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, free and clear
of  all Liens (for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not  include
licenses of or other grants of rights to use  Intellectual Property). Except
for as set forth in  _Section 4.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter_, 
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding  any bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations having the  right to vote (or
convertible into, or exchangeable or  exercisable for, securities having the
right to vote) with the  stockholders of the Company or such Subsidiary on
any matter.  Except for the  Top-Up  Option and except as set forth above
in this  _Section 4.2(a)_, there are no outstanding  (A) shares of capital
stock or other voting securities or  equity interests of the Company, (B)

obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any such securities  or to issue, grant, deliver or 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  sell, or cause to be issued, granted, delivered or sold, any  such
securities. Except as set forth in _Section 4.2(a)  of the Company Disclosure
Letter_, there are no stockholder  agreements, voting trusts or other
agreements or understandings  to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or on  file with the Company with respect to the holding,
voting,  registration, redemption, repurchase or disposition of, or that 
restricts the transfer of, any capital stock or other equity  interest of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  



  

  (b) _Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure  Letter_ sets forth a true
and complete list of all holders,  as of May 8, 2011, of outstanding Company
Options or other  rights to purchase or receive Shares or similar rights, 
including restricted stock, stock performance shares or awards,  stock
appreciation rights and other forms of long-term  incentives granted under
the Company Equity Plans or otherwise,  indicating, with respect to each
Company Option then  outstanding, the type of award granted, the number of
Common  Shares subject to such Company Option, the name of the plan  under
which such Company Option was granted, the date of grant,  exercise price,
vesting schedule and expiration thereof, and  whether (and to what extent)
the vesting of such Company Option  will be accelerated in any way by the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the 
termination of employment or engagement or change in position of  any holder
thereof following or in connection with the Merger.  Each Company Option
intended to qualify as an "incentive  stock option" under Section 422 of the
Code so  qualifies and the exercise price of each other Company Option is 
no less than the fair market value of a Share as determined on  the date of
grant of such Company Option. The Company has made  available to Parent true
and complete copies of all Company  Equity Plans and the forms of all stock
option agreements  evidencing outstanding Company Options. 

  



  

  Section 4.3 __Subsidiaries_._ _Section 4.3  of the Company Disclosure
Letter_ sets forth a true and  complete list of each Subsidiary of the
Company, including its  jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, and a
true and  complete list of each other corporation, partnership, limited 
liability company or other entity that is not a Subsidiary but  in which the
Company, directly or indirectly, holds an equity  interest (each, a "
_Company Minority Interest  Business_ "). All of the shares of capital stock
or other  equity or voting interests of each such Company Minority  Interest
Business that are owned, directly or indirectly, by the  Company or a
Subsidiary thereof are owned free and clear of all  Liens. Except for the
capital stock of, or other equity or  voting interests in, its Subsidiaries,
and its interests in the  Company Minority Interest Businesses, the Company
does not own,  directly or indirectly, any equity, membership interest, 
partnership interest, joint venture interest, or other equity or  voting
interest in, or any interest convertible into,  exercisable or exchangeable
for any of the foregoing, nor is it  under any current or prospective
obligation to form or  participate in, provide funds to, make any loan,
capital  contribution, guarantee, credit enhancement or other investment 
in, or assume any liability or obligation of, any Person. 

  



  

  Section 4.4 __Authority_._  

  



  

  (a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and  authority to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under  this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated  hereby. The execution, delivery and
performance of this  Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of  the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized 
by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and  no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are  necessary to approve
this Agreement or to consummate the  transactions contemplated hereby,
subject, in the case of the  consummation of the Merger and if required by
applicable Law, to  the adoption and approval of this Agreement by the
holders of at  least a majority of the Common Shares, the Series B 
Preferred Shares and the Series C Preferred Shares, voting  as a single class
(with (x) each Series B Preferred  Share being entitled to that number of
votes equal to the  largest number of whole Common Shares into which such
shares  could be converted and (y) each Series C Preferred  Share being
entitled to one vote) (the " _Company  Stockholder Approval_ "), and to the
filing of the  Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State  of Delaware as required by the DGCL. The Promenade Trust, as the 
sole holder of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and  Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock, has consented to the  Merger (the " _Series B and C
Consent_") and  no further separate consent or approval of The Promenade
Trust  is required in respect of this Agreement, the Merger or the  other
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been  duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due  authorization, execution and
delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,  constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company,  enforceable against the Company in accordance
with its terms  (except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by 
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  reorganization or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of  creditors
rights generally or by general principles of  equity). 

  



  

  (b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held at  which all
directors of the Company were present duly and validly  adopted resolutions
(i) determining that the terms of this  Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions  contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best
interests of the  Companys stockholders, (ii) approving and declaring 
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated  hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger, (iii) directing  that this Agreement be submitted

Companys stockholders accept the  Offer, tender their shares pursuant to the
Offer and vote in  favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and
the  transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the  Merger
(if required by applicable Law) (this clause (iv),  the " _Company
Recommendation_ ") and  (v) irrevocably approving for all purposes each of
Parent,  Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates and this Agreement  and
the transactions contemplated hereby to exempt such Persons,  agreements and
transactions from any "moratorium,"  "fair price," "business combination," 
"control share acquisition" or similar provision of  any state anti-takeover
Law (collectively, " _Takeover  Laws_ ") of any jurisdiction that may purport
to be  applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their 
respective Affiliates or this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated
hereby, which resolutions have not been  subsequently rescinded, modified or
withdrawn in any way, except  as may be permitted by _Section 6.2_. 

  



  

  (c) In the event that Section 253 of the DGCL is  inapplicable and
unavailable to effectuate the Merger, other  than the Company Stockholder
Approval and the Series B and  C Consent, there are no other votes of holders
of any class of  securities of the Company which are required in connection
with  the consummation of the Merger. No vote of the holders of any  class
or series of the Companys capital stock or other  securities is required in
connection with the consummation of  any of the transactions contemplated
hereby to be consummated by  the Company other than the Merger. 

  



  

  Section 4.5 __No  Conflict; Consents and Approvals_._  

  



  

  (a) Except as set forth on _Section 4.5 of the  Company Disclosure
Letter_, the execution, delivery and  performance of this Agreement by the
Company does not, and the  consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions  contemplated hereby and compliance by the Company with
the  provisions hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any  violation
or breach of, or default (with or without notice or  lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of, or  result in, termination, cancellation,
modification or  acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit 
under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of  the
properties, assets or rights of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries
under, or give rise to any increased, additional,  accelerated or guaranteed
rights or entitlements under, or  require any consent, waiver or approval of
any Person pursuant  to any provision of (i) the Company Charter or Company 
Bylaws, or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or  similar
organizational documents) of any Subsidiary of the  Company, (ii) any bond,
debenture, note, mortgage,  indenture, guarantee, license, lease, purchase or
sale order or  other contract, commitment, agreement, instrument,

(each, including all amendments thereto, a  " _Contract_ ") to which the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any
of its  Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may  be
bound or (iii) subject to the governmental filings and  other matters
referred to in _Section 4.5(b)_, any  material federal, state, local or

judicial,  arbitral, legislative, executive, regulatory or self-regulatory 
authority, instrumentality, agency, commission, tribunal or body  (each, a "
_Governmental Entity_ ") is required by  or with respect to the Company or
any of its 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery and  performance
of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation  by the Company of the
Offer, the Merger and the other  transactions contemplated hereby or
compliance with the  provisions hereof, except for (i) the filing of the

filed,  (ii) such filings and reports as required pursuant to the 
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and  regulations
promulgated thereunder, (iii) the filing of the  Certificate of Merger with

heretofore made available to Parent, true and complete  copies of all forms,
reports, schedules, statements and other  documents required to be filed by
the Company with the SEC since  January 1, 2008 (all such filed documents,
together with  all exhibits and schedules thereto and all information 
incorporated therein by reference, the " _Company SEC  Documents_ "). As of
their respective filing dates (and,  in the case of registration statements
and proxy statements, as  of the dates of effectiveness and the dates of
mailing,  respectively), the Company SEC Documents complied, and all 
documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC after  the date
hereof (the " _Subsequent Company SEC  Documents_ ") will comply, in all
material respects with  the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, as  amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange  Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the  " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may
be,  including, in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated 
thereunder, and none of the Company SEC Documents contained, and  the
Subsequent Company SEC Documents will not contain, any  untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted, or will omit, to  state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary  in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Except  to the extent that information contained in any Company SEC 
Document has been revised or superseded by a later filed Company  SEC
Document filed not later than five (5) Business Days  prior to the date
hereof (with respect to such time frame,  excluding any filings on  Form
10-Q  within such five (5) Business Day period), none of the  Company SEC
Documents contains any untrue statement of a  material fact or omits to state
a material fact required to be  stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were  made, not misleading. 

  



  

  (b) The financial statements (including the related notes  thereto)
included (or incorporated by reference) in the Company  SEC Documents comply
as to form in all material respects with  applicable accounting requirements
and the published rules and  regulations of the SEC with respect thereto,
have been prepared  in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles  (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited  statements, as
permitted by  Form 10-Q  of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during
the periods  involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto),
have  been prepared in a manner consistent with the books and records  of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and fairly present in all  material
respects the consolidated financial position of the  Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their  respective consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for  the periods then ended (subject, in
the case of unaudited  statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit
adjustments  that were not, or are not expected to be, individually or in
the  aggregate, material in amount), all in accordance with GAAP and  the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. The  books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been,  and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance  with GAAP (to the extent
applicable) and any other applicable  legal and accounting requirements and
reflect only actual  transactions. Since January 1, 2008, the Company has
not  made any change in the accounting practices or policies applied  in the
preparation of its financial statements, except as  required by GAAP, SEC
rule or policy or applicable Law. 

  



  

  (c) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company  and the
principal financial officer of the Company (or each  former principal
executive officer of the Company and each  former principal financial officer
of the Company, as  applicable) has made all certifications required by 
Rule 13a-14  or 15d-14  under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of
the  Sarbanes Oxley Act with respect to the Company SEC Documents,  and the
statements contained in such certifications are true and  accurate. For
purposes of this Agreement, "principal  executive officer" and "principal
financial  officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the  Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has  arranged any outstanding,
"extensions of credit" to  directors or executive officers within the meaning
of  Section 402 of the 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company has no reason to believe that  its outside
auditors and its principal executive officer and  principal financial officer
will not be able to give, without  qualification, the certificates and
attestations required  pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when due. 

  



  

  (d) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no  outstanding or
unresolved comments in the comment letters  received from the SEC staff with
respect to the Company SEC  Documents. To the knowledge of the Company, as of
the date of  this Agreement, none of the Company SEC Documents is subject
to  ongoing review or outstanding SEC comment or investigation. The  Company
has made available to Parent true, correct and complete  copies of all
written correspondence between the SEC, on the one  hand, and the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the other  hand, occurring since January 1,
2008. 

  



  

  (e) The records, systems, controls, data and information of  the Company
and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored,  maintained and operated under

computerized or not)  that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of the  Company or its Subsidiaries (including all means of access

reasonably be expected to have  a Material Adverse Effect on the system of
internal accounting  controls described below in this _Section 4.6(e)_. The 
Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain a  system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide  reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in  accordance with GAAP. The Company (i) has
implemented and  maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in  Rule 13a-15(e)  of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information  relating to the Company, including its consolidated 
Subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and  the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company by others within  those entities and (ii)
has disclosed, based on its most  recent evaluation prior to the date of this
Agreement, to the  Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of
the  Company Board (A) any significant deficiencies and material  weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal controls over  financial reporting (as
defined in  Rule 13a-15(f)  of the Exchange Act) that would be reasonably
likely to  adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, 
summarize and report financial information and (B) any  fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or  other employees who have a significant
role in the  Companys internal controls over financial reporting. A  true,
correct and complete summary of any such disclosures made  by management to
the Companys auditors and audit committee  is set forth as _Section 4.6(e)
of the Company Disclosure  Letter_. 

  



  

  (f) Except as set forth in _Section 4.6(f) of the  Company Disclosure
Letter_, since January 1, 2008,  (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to  the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,
employee,  auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of 
its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained  knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or  claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or  auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
internal  accounting controls, including any material complaint, 
allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries
has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing  practices and (ii) no
attorney representing the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of
a material  violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or 
similar violation by the Company or any of its officers,  directors,
employees or agents to the Company Board any  committee thereof or to any
director or officer of the Company. 

  



  

  (g) No Subsidiary of the Company is or has been required to  file any

  Section 4.7 __No  Undisclosed Liabilities_._ Neither the Company  nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations  of any nature,
whether accrued, absolute, contingent or  otherwise, known or unknown,
whether due or to become due and  whether or not required to be recorded or
reflected on a balance  sheet under GAAP, except (a) to the extent accrued
or  reserved against in the audited consolidated balance sheet (and  the
notes thereto) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at  December 31, 2010
included in the Company SEC Documents;  and (b) for liabilities and
obligations incurred in the  ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since  December 31, 2010, that, individually or in the aggregate, 
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries
is a party to, or has any commitment to become a  party to, any joint
venture, off-balance sheet partnership or  any similar contract or
arrangement (including any contract  relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any  unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured
finance,  special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the  other
hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements"  (as defined in Item 303(a)
of  Regulation S-K  of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of
such  contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction 
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries in the Companys audited financial statements  or other Company
SEC Documents.

Statement, the  Schedule 14D-9  and the  Schedule 13E-3  (as to
information supplied by the Company or any of its  Representatives) will
comply as to form in all material respects  with the provisions of the
Exchange Act. The letter to  stockholders, notice of meeting, proxy statement
and forms of  proxy and other soliciting material, or the information 
statement, as the case may be, to be distributed to stockholders  in
connection with the Merger to be filed with the SEC are  collectively
referred to herein as the " _Proxy  Statement_." None of the information
supplied or to be  supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or 
incorporation by reference in any of the Offer Documents or the  Schedule
13E-3  will, at the respective times they are first filed with the SEC, 
amended or supplemented or first published, sent or given to the  Companys
stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a  material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be  stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in  light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not  misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no 
representation or warranty with respect to the information  supplied in

and all stock purchase, stock  option, severance, employment,  change-in-
control,  fringe benefit, bonus, incentive, deferred compensation and all 
other employee benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies or  other
arrangements, whether or not subject to ERISA (including  any funding

the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement or otherwise), under which
any employee or former  employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries has any
present or  future right to benefits or the Company or its Subsidiaries has 
any present or future liability. All such plans, agreements,  programs,
policies and arrangements shall be collectively  referred to as the "

agreement or other funding instrument, (ii) the most  recent determination
letter of the Internal Revenue Service (the  " _IRS_ "), if applicable, (iii)

  (c) With respect to the Company Plans, except as disclosed  in the Company
SEC Documents or to the extent that the  inaccuracy of any of the
representations set forth in this  _Section 4.12(c)_, individually or in the
aggregate,  have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a 
Material Adverse Effect: 

  



  

  (i) each Company Plan has been established and administered  in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and in  compliance with the
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code,  and no prohibited transaction,
as described in Section 406  of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code has
occurred with  respect to any Company Plan, and all contributions required
to  be made under the terms of any Company Plan have been timely  made;

the Code has received a favorable  determination, advisory  and/or  opinion
letter, as applicable, from the IRS, with respect to the  most recent
legislation for which such a letter is available,  that it is so qualified
and nothing has occurred since the date  of such letter that would reasonably
be expected to cause the  loss of such qualified status of such Company
Plan; 

   
 ##### 

  

   



  

  (iii) there is no Action (including any investigation,  audit or other
administrative proceeding) by the Department of  Labor, the IRS or any other
Governmental Entity or by any plan  participant or beneficiary pending, or to
the knowledge of the  Company, threatened, relating to the Company Plans,
any  fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Company  Plans
or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the  Company Plans (other
than routine claims for benefits) nor are  there facts or circumstances that
exist that could reasonably  give rise to any such Actions; 

  



  

  (iv) with respect to any Company Plan that provides  post-employment
welfare benefits, the FAS 106 liabilities  of the Company or its Subsidiaries
set forth in the financial  statements included (or incorporated by
reference) in the  Company SEC Documents and the assumptions used therefor 
accurately reflect the costs associated with the rights and  benefit of all
employees of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries; 

  



  

  (v) none of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any other  Person that
would be treated as a single employer with the  Company under Section 414(b),
(c), (m) or (o) of  the Code (each, a  _Commonly Controlled  Entity_ ")
has incurred any direct or indirect material  liability under ERISA or the
Code in connection with the  termination of, withdrawal from or failure to
fund, any Company  Plan or other retirement plan or arrangement to which
the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries could become subject  following the
date hereof, and no fact or event exists that  could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any such liability; 

  



  

  (vi) the Company and its Subsidiaries do not maintain any  Company Plan
that is a "group health plan" (as such  term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1)
of the Code) that has  not been administered and operated in all respects in
compliance  with the applicable requirements of Section 601 of ERISA  and
Section 4980B(b) of the Code, and the Company and its  Subsidiaries are not
subject to any material liability,  including additional contributions,
fines, penalties or loss of  Tax deduction as a result of such administration
and  operation; and 

  



  

  (vii) except as set forth in _Section 4.12(c)(vii)  of the Company
Disclosure Letter_, none of the Company Plans  provides for payment of a
benefit, the increase of a benefit  amount, the payment of a contingent
benefit or the acceleration  of the payment or vesting of a benefit
determined or occasioned,  in whole or in part, by reason of the execution of
this  Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated 
hereby. 

  



  

  (d) Each Company Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred  compensation plan"
within the meaning of  Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code (a " _Nonqualified 
Deferred Compensation Plan_ "), if any, subject to  Section 409A of the Code
has been operated in compliance  with Section 409A of the Code since January
1, 2006,  based upon a good faith, reasonable interpretation of  (i) Section
409A of the Code and (ii) IRS Notice  2005-1 or  any other applicable IRS
guidance, in each case as modified by  IRS Notice  2007-86  (clauses (i)
and (ii), together, the " _409A  Authorities_ "). No Company Plan that would
be a  Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan subject to  Section 409A of
the Code but for the effective date  provisions that are applicable to
Section 409A of the Code,  as set forth in Section 885(d) of the American
Jobs  Creation Act of 2004, as amended (the "AJCA"),  (A) has been
"materially modified" within the  meaning of Section 885(d)(2)(B) of the AJCA
after  October 3, 2004, based upon a good faith reasonable  interpretation
of the AJCA and the 409A Authorities and  (B) has not been operated in
compliance with the 409A  Authorities. No Participant is entitled to any 
gross-up,  make-whole or other additional payment from the Company or any 
of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Taxes imposed under  Section 409A of
the Code or interest or penalty related  thereto. For purposes of this
_Section 4.12_,  " _Participant_ " shall mean current or former  director,
officer, employee, contractor or consultant of the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. 

  



  

  (e) Except as set forth on _Section 4.12(e) of the  Company Disclosure
Letter_, neither the execution of this  Agreement, stockholder approval of
this Agreement nor the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(alone or  in connection with any other event) will result in  (i) payments
made to any employee, officer, director or  independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  that would constitute an "excess
parachute payment"  within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or  (ii)
payments under any Company Plan which would not  reasonably be expected to be
deductible under  Section 162(m) of the Code.

Subsidiaries are otherwise represented by  a works council or other labor
organization excluding unions,  guilds or similar

its Subsidiaries, and there  has been no material labor dispute, strike, work
stoppage or  lockout in the previous three years. To the knowledge of the 
Company, there are no organizational efforts with respect to the  formation
of a collective bargaining unit presently being made  or threatened involving
employees of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries and there have been no
such organizational efforts  in the previous three (3) years. Neither the

Company or any of its  Subsidiaries before the National Labor Relations
Board, the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any other 
Governmental Entity. 

  



  

  (b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a  party to, or
otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or  citation by, any
Governmental Entity relating to employees or  employment practices. None of
the Company, any of its  Subsidiaries or any of its or their executive
officers has  received within the past three years any notice of intent by

  Subsidiaries has timely paid or caused to be timely paid all  Taxes shown
on such Tax Returns to be due with respect to the  taxable periods covered by
such Tax Returns and all other Taxes  as are due (including Taxes for which

reserve (in addition to any reserve for deferred Taxes  established to

to or bound by any written  Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnity obligation
or similar  arrangement with respect to Taxes (including any advance
pricing  agreement, closing agreement or other similar agreement related  to
Taxes) (other than any such agreement, obligation or  arrangement between or
among the Company and its Subsidiaries). 

  



  

  (d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries  (i) has been a member
of an affiliated group of  corporations with the meaning of Section 1504 of

withheld  from and paid over to the proper Governmental Entities all 
amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under  applicable Laws.

income tax within the  meaning of Section 6662 of the Code, and neither the 
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever participated in any  listed
transaction, as defined in Treasury Regulation  Section 1.6011-4(b)(2), 
required to be reported in a disclosure statement pursuant to  Treasury 
Regulation Section 1.6011-4.

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries was a  "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled  corporation" in a transaction intended to be governed by 
Section 355 of the Code. 

  



  

  (i) As used in this Agreement,  (i) " _Taxes_ " shall include (A) all 
forms of taxation, whenever created or imposed, and whether  domestic or
foreign, and whether imposed by a national, federal,  state, provincial,
local

transaction that is no less favorable to  the stockholders of the Company
than any Acquisition Proposal  that is deemed to constitute a Superior
Proposal after giving  effect to, among other things, the payment of the
Termination  Fee set forth in _Section 8.3_. 

  



  

  The Company shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change or  terminate
this Agreement if, prior to the expiration of the  Notice Period, Parent
makes a proposal to adjust the terms and  conditions of this Agreement that
the Company Board determines  in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel and  its financial advisor) to be at least as favorable to
the  stockholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal after  giving
effect to, among other things, the payment of the  Termination Fee set forth
in _Section 8.3_. 

  



  

  (d) The Company shall not take any action to  (i) exempt any Person (other
than Parent, Merger Sub and  their respective Affiliates) from the
restrictions on  "business combinations" contained in Section 203  of the
DGCL (or any similar provision of any other Takeover Law)  or otherwise cause
such restrictions not to apply, or exempt,  waive or amend any provision of
the Rights Agreement with  respect to any Person (other than Parent, Merger
Sub and their  respective Affiliates), or agree to do any of the foregoing,
in  each case unless such actions are taken substantially  concurrently with
a termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)(iv)_. Nothing
contained in  this _Section 6.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement  shall
prohibit the Company Board from (i) complying with  its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law  with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, including taking and  disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by  Rule 14d-9  and 14e-2(a)  promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any other similar  communication to stockholders); _provided_ , that
any such  disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"  communication or
similar communication of the type contemplated  by  Rule 14d-9(f)  under
the Exchange Act) shall be deemed an Adverse  Recommendation Change unless
the Company Board expressly  publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation
or  (ii) making any "stop, look and listen"  communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated  by  Rule 14d-9(f)  under the
Exchange Act.

indirect  acquisition or purchase, or could result in ownership, whether  of
record, beneficial or otherwise, in one transaction or a  series of
transactions, including any merger, reorganization,  consolidation, tender
offer, self-tender, exchange offer, stock  acquisition, asset acquisition,
binding share exchange, business  combination, recapitalization, liquidation,

  15% or more of the total assets (based on fair market value), of  the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately  prior to such
transaction, (B) of 15% or more of any class  of capital stock, other equity
security or voting power of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
resulting parent  company of the Company, (C) involving the Company or any
of  its Subsidiaries, individually or taken together, whose  businesses
constitute 15% or more of the net revenues, net  income or total assets
(based on fair market value) of the  Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, immediately  prior to such transaction, or (D) involving any
combination  of the foregoing, in each case other than the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement. 

  



  

  (ii) _  _Superior Proposal_ "_  means any unsolicited, bona fide,
binding written Acquisition  Proposal that contemplates paying cash 
and/or  securities for the Common Shares and which the Company Board 
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside  counsel and its
financial advisor), taking into account all  legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the proposal  and the Person making the proposal, and, which
is not subject to  a financing condition or, if financing is required, such 
financing is then fully committed on a basis that is subject to  no greater
conditions, individually or in the aggregate, than  the Financing, (A) is
more favorable to the stockholders of  the Company from a financial point of
view than the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement (including any
adjustment to the  terms and conditions proposed by Parent in response to
such  proposal pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)_ or otherwise,  and including the
Termination Fee hereunder and any  break-up  fees and expense reimbursement
provisions thereof) and  (B) is reasonably likely of being completed on the
terms  proposed on a timely basis; _provided_ , that, for purposes  of this
definition of "Superior Proposal," references  in the term "Acquisition

  (f) In no event shall the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries or its
Representatives be deemed to be in breach of  their respective obligations
under this _Section 6.2_  with respect to conducting any discussions or
negotiations with,  providing information to or entry into a letter of
intent,  memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition 
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture  agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement with, any  Person with respect to a
transaction that is permitted pursuant  to _Section 6.1(d)_ of this
Agreement. 

  



  

  Section 6.3 __Preparation  of Proxy Statement; Stockholders   Meeting_._
 

  



  

  (a) The Company shall prepare, and if approval of, or  notification to,
the Companys stockholders is required by  applicable Law to consummate the
Merger, then the Company shall  use commercially reasonable efforts to file
with the SEC not  later than three (3) Business Days (and in any event
Parent  shall file not later than five (5) Business Days) following  the
consummation of the Offer or, to the extent permitted by  applicable Law, the
written request of Parent (in which case the  Company shall file with the SEC
not later than ten  (10) calendar days), as applicable, the Proxy Statement
in  preliminary form relating to the Merger and the other  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as required by the  Exchange Act. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts  to have the Proxy Statement cleared by
the SEC and shall use its  commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to  be mailed to the Companys stockholders not later than  three
(3) Business Days following the date of such  clearance (and in any event
Parent shall cause the Proxy  Statement to be mailed not later than five (5)
Business  Days following the date of such clearance); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement,  the Company
shall consult with Parent with respect to such  filings and shall afford
Parent or its Representatives  reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.
Parent and Merger Sub  shall provide the Company with any information for
inclusion in  the Proxy Statement which may be required under applicable
Law  or which is reasonably requested by the Company. The Company  shall
notify Parent of the receipt of comments of the SEC or its  staff and of any
request from the SEC or its staff for  amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or for  additional information, and will promptly supply Parent
with  copies of all correspondence between the Company or its 
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or members of its  staff, on
the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.  Each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall use its  respective reasonable best efforts to
resolve all SEC comments  with respect to the Proxy Statement and any other
required  filings as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. 
Concurrently with the preparation and filing of the Proxy  Statement, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall jointly  prepare and file with the SEC
the  Schedule 13E-3  with respect to the Merger. Each of the Company, Parent
and  Merger Sub shall cooperate and consult in the preparation of the 
Schedule 13E-3,  including furnishing all information relating to such
party  required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the  Schedule
13E-3.  Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its  reasonable
best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect  to the  Schedule
13E-3. 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree to correct any 
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement or  Schedule
13E-3  which shall have become false or misleading. If at any time  prior to
the Company Stockholders Meeting any event should  occur which is required
by applicable Law to be set forth in an  amendment of, or a supplement to,
the Proxy Statement or  Schedule 13E-3,  the party that discovers such
information will promptly inform  the other parties hereto. In the case of
any required amendment  of the Proxy Statement, the Company, with the
cooperation of  Parent, will, upon learning of such event, promptly prepare
and  file such amendment or supplement with the SEC to the extent  required
by applicable Law and shall mail such amendment or  supplement of or to the
Proxy Statement to the Companys  stockholders to the extent required by
applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to such filing, the 
Company shall consult with Parent with respect to such amendment  or
supplement and shall afford Parent or its Representatives  reasonable
opportunity to comment thereon. In the case of any  required amendment to
the  Schedule 13E-3,  the parties will jointly, upon learning of such event,
promptly  prepare and file such amendment or supplement with the SEC to  the
extent required by applicable Law. 

  



  

  (b) If approval of the Companys stockholders is  required by applicable
Law to consummate the Merger, then, if  this Agreement cannot be approved by
a written consent of the  Companys stockholders without a meeting, as
promptly as  practicable following the consummation of the Offer or, if 
requested by Parent, following the Offer Termination, as  applicable, and
after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC  for mailing to the Companys
stockholders (or at any such  time prior to clearance by the SEC if the
Company determines it  advisable), the Company shall establish a record date
for, duly  call and give notice of a special meeting of its stockholders 
(the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "), solely  for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval.  Subject to the last sentence of
this _Section 6.3(b)_,  the Company Stockholders Meeting shall be held not
later than  two (2) Business Days following the earliest date permitted  by
the Company Bylaws, NASDAQ rules and applicable Law. Except  in the case of
an Adverse Recommendation Change specifically  permitted by _Section 6.2_,
the Company Recommendation  shall be included in the Proxy Statement and the
Company shall,  and shall cause its directors, officers, employees and
other  Representatives to, use their reasonable best efforts to make 
solicitations and recommendations to the holders of Shares for  purposes of
causing the adoption and approval of this Agreement  by the Companys
stockholders. If on the date for which the  Company Stockholders Meeting is
scheduled, the Company has not  received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares of  Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval,  whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall be 
entitled to elect to adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting  one (1) time
(and shall adjourn the Company Stockholders  Meeting if requested by Parent)
to a date specified by the  Company (or specified by Parent, if so
requested), but in no  event, if such adjournment is elected by the Company,
to a date  that is more than thirty (30) days after the date from  which the
Company Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled  (excluding any
adjournments or postponements required by  applicable Law). 

  



  

  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (a) and (b),  if following the
Acceptance Time or the exercise of the  Top-Up  Option, Parent, Merger Sub
or any other direct or indirect  Subsidiary of Parent shall collectively hold
at least  90 percent (90%) of each of the outstanding Common Shares  and the
outstanding Series B Preferred Shares and the  outstanding Series C Preferred
Share, each of Parent,  Merger Sub and the Company shall (subject to 
_Section 7.1_) take all necessary and appropriate  action to cause the Merger
to become effective as soon as  practicable after the consummation of the
purchase of Shares  without a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in
accordance  with Section 253 of the DGCL. 

  



  

  Section 6.4 __Access  to Information; Confidentiality_._ The Company 
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to  Parent, Merger
Sub and their respective Representatives  reasonable access during normal
business hours, during the  period prior to the Effective Time or the
termination of this  Agreement in accordance with its terms, to all their
respective  properties, assets, books, contracts, commitments, personnel
and  records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall  cause
each of its Subsidiaries to: (a) furnish promptly to  Parent (i) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration  statement and other document filed or
received by it during such  period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state  securities Laws and (ii) all other information concerning  its
business, properties and personnel as Parent or Merger Sub  may reasonably
request (including Tax Returns filed and those in  preparation and the
workpapers of its auditors);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
shall not  require the Company to disclose any information to the extent 
such disclosure would contravene applicable Law; and (b) at  the request of
Parent, use reasonable best efforts to facilitate  and arrange introductions,
meetings and discussions 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  between Parent and its Representatives and customers, suppliers  and other
Persons with whom the Company has business relations.  All such information
shall be held confidential in accordance  with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement between Apollo  Management VII, L.P. and the
Company dated as of April 18,  2010 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").
No  investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ or  information provided,
made available or delivered to Parent  pursuant to this Agreement shall
affect any of the  representations, warranties, covenants, rights or
remedies, or  the conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereunder. 

  



  

  Section 6.5 __Reasonable  Best Efforts_._ Upon the terms and subject to 
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties  agrees to
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be  taken, all actions that
are necessary, proper or advisable to  consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner  practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable
best  efforts to accomplish the following: (i) obtain all  required
consents, approvals or waivers from, or participation  in other discussions

and the Antitrust Division of the United  States Department of Justice (the "
_DOJ_ "),  (iii) contest any Action instituted (or threatened to be 
instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any Governmental Entity,  including
administrative or judicial Action, and seek to have  vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,  injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or  permanent) that is in effect in the
United States or applicable  foreign jurisdiction and that could restrict,
prevent or  prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, 
including by pursuing all avenues of administrative and judicial  appeal, and
(iv) execute and deliver any additional  instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions  contemplated hereby and fully to carry out the purposes of
this  Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) in no  event shall
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries be required to
pay any fee, penalty or other  consideration to any third party, unless such
payment would be,  individually or in the aggregate, in an amount that would
not be  material, to obtain any consent or approval required for the 
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions  contemplated
hereby other than antitrust filing fees and  (B) neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall  commit to any concession, waiver or amendment
under any Contract  in connection with obtaining any consent without the
prior  written consent of Parent. Each of the parties hereto shall  furnish
to each other party such necessary information and  reasonable assistance as
such other party may reasonably request  in connection with the foregoing.
Subject to applicable Law  relating to the exchange of information, Parent
and the Company  shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent  practicable each shall consult with the other in connection  with,
all of the material information relating to Parent or the  Company, as the
case may be, and any of their respective  Subsidiaries, that appears in any
filing made with, or written  materials submitted to, any third party 
and/or any  Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger
and  the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except  for 4(c)
documents filed pursuant to the HSR Act. In exercising  the foregoing rights,
each of Parent and the Company shall act  reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Subject to applicable  Law and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company  and Parent shall keep each other reasonably
apprised of the  status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions  contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other 
with copies of notices or other written communications received  by the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their  respective
Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity  and/or third  party with respect
to such transactions, and, to the extent  practicable under the
circumstances, shall provide the other  party and its counsel with the
opportunity to participate in any  meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filing,  investigation or other inquiry in connection with
the  transactions contemplated hereby. All confidential or  proprietary
information received by any party in connection with  the foregoing shall be
held confidential and not used or  disclosed except to the extent that

exchange or  national securities quotation system. 

  



  

  Section 6.6 __Takeover  Laws_._ The Company and the Company Board shall 
(a) take no action to cause any Takeover Law to become  applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other  transactions contemplated hereby
and (b) if any Takeover  Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Offer, the  Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, 
take all action necessary to ensure that the Offer, the Merger  and the
other 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly  as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and  otherwise to
eliminate, or, if not possible, to minimize to the  maximum extent possible,
the effect of such Takeover Law with  respect to this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger and the other  transactions contemplated hereby. No Adverse
Recommendation  Change shall change the approval of the Company Board for 
purposes of causing any Takeover Law to be inapplicable to the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

  



  

  Section 6.7 __Notification  of Certain Matters; Stockholder Actions_._  

  



  

  (a) The Company and Parent shall promptly notify each other  of (i) any
notice or other communication received by such  party from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger  or the other transactions contemplated
hereby or from any Person  alleging that the consent of such Person is or may
be required  in connection with the Offer or the Merger or the other 
transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such 
communication could be material to the Company, the Surviving  Corporation or
Parent, (ii) any Action commenced or, to  such partys knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or  involving or otherwise affecting such party or any
of its  Subsidiaries which relate to the Offer or the Merger or the  other
transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) any change,  condition or event
(including any renewal, termination, or  amendment of, or any proposed
modification to, any Material  Contract) (A) that to such partys knowledge
renders  or would reasonably be expected to render any representation or 
warranty of such party set forth in this Agreement to be untrue  or
inaccurate in any material respect or (B) that results  or would reasonably
be expected to result in any failure of such  party to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or  agreement (including any of the Offer Conditions
or any  condition set forth in _Article VII_) to be complied  with or
satisfied hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that no such notification
shall affect any of the  representations, warranties, covenants, rights or
remedies, or  the conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereunder. 

  



  

  (b) In the case of any Action against the Company, any of  its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or  officers by any
stockholder of the Company relating to the Offer  or the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, the  Company shall promptly provide copies
to Parent of all  proceedings and correspondence relating to such Action and
shall  give Parent the opportunity to participate with the Company 
regarding the defense or settlement of any such stockholder  Action, shall
give due consideration to Parents advice  with respect to such stockholder
Action and shall not settle or  offer to settle any such Action without the
prior written  consent of Parent. 

  



  

  Section 6.8 __Indemnification,  Exculpation and Insurance_._  

  



  

  (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to  exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for  acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time,  whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective  Time, now existing in favor of the current or former
directors,  officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or
its  Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of 
incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents or in  any
agreement shall survive the Offer, the Merger and shall  continue in full
force and effect. The Surviving Corporation  shall maintain in effect any and
all exculpation,  indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of
the  Companys and any of its Subsidiaries articles of  incorporation and
bylaws or similar organizational documents in  effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time or in any  indemnification agreements of the Company and
its Subsidiaries  with any of their respective current or former directors, 
officers or employees in effect as of the date hereof, and shall  not for
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time  amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any such provisions in any  manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any  individuals who at the Effective Time were current
or former  directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries and all rights to indemnification in respect of any  Action
pending or asserted or any claim made within such period  shall continue
until the disposition of such Action or  resolution of such claim. 

  



  

  (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time,  Parent shall
cause to be maintained in effect the Companys  current directors and
officers liability insurance  covering each Person currently covered by the
Companys  directors and officers liability insurance policy (a  correct
and complete copy of which has been heretofore made  available to Parent) for
acts or omissions occurring prior to  the Effective Time; _provided_ , that
Parent may  (i) substitute therefor policies of an insurance company  the
material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are  not materially
less favorable in the aggregate to such directors  and officers than the
Companys existing policies as of the  date hereof or (ii) request that the
Company obtain such  extended reporting period coverage under its existing
insurance  programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time); and 
_provided_ _further_ , that 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  in no event shall Parent or the Company be required to pay  aggregate
premiums for insurance under this  _Section 6.8(b)_ in excess of 300% of the
amount of  the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for fiscal year 2010 
for such purpose (which fiscal year 2010 premiums are hereby  represented and
warranted by the Company to be as set forth in  _Section 6.8(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter_), it  being understood that Parent shall
nevertheless be obligated to  provide such coverage as may be obtained for
such 300% amount.  The Company may purchase a "tail" policy prior to the 
Closing (which policy by its express terms shall survive the  Merger) which
(i) has an effective term of six  (6) years from the Effective Time, (ii)
covers each  Person covered by the Companys existing directors  and
officers insurance policies in effect as of the date  of this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Existing  Policies_ "), for actions and omissions
occurring prior  to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains terms that are
no  less favorable in the aggregate than the Existing Policies, and 
Parents obligations under this _Section 6.8(b)_  shall be deemed to be
satisfied so long as Parent causes the  "tail" policy to be maintained in
effect by the  Surviving Corporation for six (6) years from the Effective 
Time. 

  



  

  (c) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of  its successors
or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or  merge into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or  surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger  or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its
properties  and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper 
provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of the  Surviving
Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.8_. 

  



  

  (d) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ shall  survive consummation of
the Merger and are intended to be for  the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified  party, his or her heirs and his or her
legal representatives. 

  



  

  Section 6.9 __Equity  Financing_._ Parent shall use its commercially 
reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Equity  Commitment Letter,
(ii) satisfy on a timely basis all  conditions applicable to Parent and
Merger Sub to obtaining the  Cash Equity set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter that are  within their control, and (iii) consummate the financing
of  the Cash Equity at or promptly after the Acceptance Time (with  respect
to amounts required to consummate the Offer) and at or  prior to the Closing
Date (with respect to amounts required to  consummate the Merger and make
such other payments required at  the Effective Time pursuant to the terms
hereof). Parent shall  not, and shall cause Merger Sub not to, without the
prior  written consent of the Company, amend, modify or supplement  (x) any
of the conditions or contingencies to funding  contained in the Equity
Commitment Letter, or (y) any other  provision of the Equity Commitment
Letter, in either case, to  the extent such amendment, modification or
supplement would  reasonably be expected to have the effect of materially 
adversely affecting the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to  timely consummate
the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement. 

  



  

  Section 6.10 __Debt  Financing_._  

  



  

  (a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective  commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect  the Debt Commitment Letter,
(ii) satisfy on a timely basis  all conditions applicable to Parent and
Merger Sub to obtaining  the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter that  are within their control, and (iii) arrange the Debt  Financing
at or promptly after the Acceptance Time (with respect  to amounts required
to consummate the Offer) and at or prior to  the Closing Date (with respect
to amounts required to consummate  the Merger and make such other payments
required at the  Effective Time pursuant to the terms hereof), including
using  their respective commercially reasonable efforts to:  (A) enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto  on the terms contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter,  (B) cause the Lenders and any other Debt Financing
Source  to fund the Debt Financing at or promptly after the Acceptance  Time
(with respect to amounts required to consummate the Offer)  and at or prior
to the Closing Date (with respect to amounts  required to consummate the
Merger and make such other payments  required at the Effective Time pursuant
to the terms hereof) and  (C) seek to enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment  Letter if in Parents reasonable judgment it is  commercially
reasonable to do so. Parent shall not, and shall  cause Merger Sub not to,
without the prior written consent of  the Company, amend, modify, supplement
or replace (1) any  of the conditions or contingencies to funding contained
in the  Debt Commitment Letter, or (2) any other provision of the  Debt
Commitment Letter, in either case, to the extent such  amendment,
modification or supplement would reasonably be  expected to have the effect
of materially adversely affecting  the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
timely consummate the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being
understood  that Parent and Merger Sub may (x) amend the Debt  Commitment
Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,  syndication agents or
similar entities who had not executed the  Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  of this Agreement or (y) otherwise amend, modify,  supplement or replace
the Debt Commitment Letter so long as the  terms are not materially less
beneficial to Parent or Merger  Sub, with respect to conditionality, than
those in the Debt  Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this
Agreement).  If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on
the  terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, 
Parent use its commercially reasonable efforts until the Offer  Outside Date
to obtain alternative debt financing from  alternative sources on terms and
conditions that are not less  favorable to Parent and Merger Sub, in the
aggregate, in any  material respect, than those contained in the Debt
Commitment  Letter and in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or 
such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the  " _Alternative
Debt Financing_ ") (it being  understood that if the Offer Termination shall
have occurred,  Parent shall not be required to replace any margin loan
included  in the Debt Financing intended to cover the period between the 
consummation of the Offer and the Closing). As used herein, the  term " _Debt
Financing_ " shall include any  Alternative Debt Financing to the extent all
or any portion of  the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter is  replaced in accordance with the foregoing. 

  



  

  (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and its  Subsidiaries agree
to use their commercially reasonable efforts  to provide and to cause their
respective Representatives,  including legal and accounting advisors to
provide, to Parent  all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is 
necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Debt  Financing (in
each case, provided that such requested  cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing  operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries),
including using  commercially reasonable efforts with respect to  (i)

  Parent to obtain waivers, consents, estoppels and approvals from  other
parties to material leases, encumbrances and contracts to  which the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party  and to arrange discussions among
Parent, Merger Sub and their  financing sources with other parties to
material leases,  encumbrances and contracts as of the Closing Date,  (viii)

necessary  rating agencies confirmation or approvals for the Debt

made available as of the Effective  Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A)
no  obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any  such
agreement, certificate, document or instrument shall be  effective until the
Acceptance Time (or, if the Offer  Termination shall have occurred, the
Effective Time) and neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be
required to pay  any commitment or other fee or incur any extraordinary
cost,  expense or other liability that is not simultaneously reimbursed  by
Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Debt Financing  prior to the
Acceptance Time (or, if the Offer Termination shall  have occurred, the
Effective Time), and (B) no Person that  is a director or officer of the
Company or its Subsidiaries  shall be required to execute any agreement,
certificate,  document or instrument with respect to the Debt Financing
that  would be effective prior to the Acceptance Time (or, if the  Offer

doubt, if requested by Parent to most  effectively access the financing
markets, the Company shall use  its commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with this  _Section 6.10(b)_ at any time, and from time to time 
and on multiple occasions, between the date hereof and the  Closing Date. In
addition, the Company agrees that if reasonably  requested by Parent it will
supplement and use commercially  reasonable efforts to keep current the
Required Information so  that Parent may most effectively access the
financing markets.  If, in connection with a marketing effort contemplated by
the  Debt Commitment Letter, the Parent reasonably requests the  Company to
file a report on  Form 8-K  pursuant to the Exchange Act that contains
material non-public  information with respect to the Company and its
subsidiaries,  which Parent reasonably determines to include in a customary 
offering memorandum for such debt, then, upon the Companys  review of and
satisfaction with such filing (it being  acknowledged and agreed that such
filing shall contain any and  all reasonable comments of the Company), the
Company shall file  such report on  Form 8-K;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not be  required to file any information on  Form
8-K  that the Company determines in good faith would reasonably be  expected
to be competitively harmful to the Company, it being  understood that
publication of an adjusted EBITDA number will  not be deemed to be
competitively harmful to the Company. Parent  shall, promptly upon request by
the Company, reimburse, or cause  its Affiliates to reimburse, the Company
for all reasonable and  documented extraordinary  out-of-pocket  costs and
expenses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries  in connection with such
cooperation and shall indemnify and hold  harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective  Representatives for and against any and
all losses suffered or  incurred by them in connection with the arrangement
of the Debt  Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith.  The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its 
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing;  _provided_ , that
such logos are used solely in a manner  that is not intended to nor
reasonably likely to harm or  disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the  reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  and its or their marks. 

  



  

  Section 6.11 __Public  Announcements_._ Each of Parent and Merger Sub,

reasonably practicable, consult with each other  before issuing, and give
each other a reasonable opportunity to  review and comment upon, any press
release or other public  statement with respect to this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger  and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not 
issue any such press release or other public statement without  the prior

derivative securities with  respect to such Shares) by each individual who is
or will be  subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of  the
Exchange

  Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under  Rule 16b-3

  Section 6.13 __Obligations  of Merger Sub_._ Parent shall take all
actions  necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to 
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement. 

  



  

  Section 6.14 __Control  of Operations_._ Without in any way limiting  any
partys rights or obligations under this Agreement, the  parties understand
and agree that (a) nothing contained in  this Agreement shall give Parent,
directly or indirectly, the  right to control or direct the Companys
operations prior  to the Acceptance Time, and (b) prior to the Acceptance 
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and  conditions
of this Agreement, complete control and supervision  over its operations. 

  



  

  Section 6.15 __Certain  Benefits_._  

  



  

  (a) From and after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall cause  the Company
(and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving  Corporation) to honor the
Company Plans (excluding any plans or  arrangements providing for the
issuance of equity or  equity-based compensation, but without limiting the 
Companys obligations pursuant to  _Section 3.2(a)_) and compensation
arrangements and  agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect 
immediately before the Acceptance Time (without giving effect to  any
amendments thereto after the Acceptance Time except if  consented to by the
affected party). For a period of one  (1) year following the Acceptance Time,
Parent shall  provide, or shall cause to be provided, to all employees of
the  Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Acceptance  Time
(" _Company Employees_ ") compensation and  benefits that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate and taken  as a whole, than the compensation and
benefits provided to  Company Employees immediately before the Acceptance
Time;  _provided_ , that (i) Parent shall not be required to,  or to cause
to be provided to, retain, implement or provide any  plans or arrangements
providing for the issuance of equity or  equity-based compensation, and (ii)
no such plans or  arrangements of the Company referred to in the
immediately  preceding _clause (i)_ shall be taken into account in 
determining whether the compensation and benefits provided to  Company
Employees during the one (1) year period following  the Acceptance Time are
no less favorable in the aggregate than  the compensation and benefits
provided to Company Employees  immediately before the Acceptance Time.
Notwithstanding any  other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, for a
period  of one (1) year following the Acceptance Time, Parent shall  or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Company  Employees whose
employment terminates during the one  (1) year period following the
Acceptance Time with  severance benefits in accordance with the applicable
severance  plans, programs, agreements and arrangements of Company as in 
effect immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (with full  service credit
for years of service with Company and its  Subsidiaries (and predecessors)
and without taking into account  any reduction after the Acceptance Time in
compensation paid to  Company Employees). 

  



  

  (b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting,  eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the  employee benefit plans of
Parent and its Subsidiaries providing  benefits to any Company Employees
after the Acceptance Time (the  " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall
be  credited with his or her years of service with the Company and  its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the  Acceptance Time,
to the same extent as such Company Employee was  entitled, before the
Acceptance Time, to credit for such service  under any similar Company
employee benefit plan in which such  Company Employee participated or was
eligible to participate  immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, _provided_
, that  the foregoing shall not apply (i) for service credit for  benefit
accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan  of Parent or its
Subsidiaries, (ii) for service credit for  eligibility purposes under any
post-retirement welfare benefit  plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries or (iii)
to the extent  such credit would result in duplication of benefits for the
same  period of service. In addition, and without limiting the  generality
of the foregoing, (A) Parent shall use  commercially reasonable efforts to
cause each Company Employee  to be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting  time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage
under such  New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such 
Company Employee participated immediately before the Acceptance  Time (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old  Plans_ "), and (B) for purposes of each New
Plan  providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical  and/or  vision benefits to
any Company Employee, Parent shall use  commercially reasonable efforts to
cause each third party  insurer to (1) waive all pre-existing condition
exclusions  and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan for such 
employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such  conditions would not
have been waived under the comparable Old  Plans 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee  participated
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time and  (2) cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee  and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan  year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
employees  participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken 
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all  deductible,
coinsurance and maximum  out-of-pocket  requirements applicable to such
employee and his or her covered  dependents for the applicable plan year as
if such amounts had  been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

  



  

  (c) Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that the  consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement  constitute a "change of
control," "change in  control" or term of similar import within the meaning
of  the Company Plans. 

  



  

  (d) Nothing in this _Section 6.15_, express or  implied, shall affect the
right of the Company (or the Surviving  Corporation, as applicable) to
terminate the employment of any  employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or shall be  construed to grant any current or former employee
of the Company  (or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable) or any of its 
Subsidiaries a right to continued employment by, or to receive  any payment
or benefits from, the Company (or the Surviving  Corporation, as applicable)
or any of its Subsidiaries or  through any Company Plan or other benefit plan
that increases or  expands such Persons rights beyond what is provided by
the  terms of such plan. Other than as expressly contemplated by this 
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the ability of  the Company
(or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable) or its  Affiliates (including
Parent and its Affiliates after the  consummation of the Offer  and/or the 
Merger) to amend or terminate any Company Plan or other benefit  or
compensation plan or program. Nothing in this Agreement,  express or implied,
shall (i) constitute an amendment to  any Company Plan or other benefit plan,
(ii) create any  third party beneficiary rights or (iii) inure to the 
benefit of or be enforceable by any employee, director or  consultant of the
Company (or the Surviving Corporation, as  applicable), any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective  Affiliates, of any entity or any Person
representing the  interest of any such employee, director or consultant or of
any  Person whose rights are derivative of any such employee,  director or
consultant (including a family member or estate of  any such employee,
director of consultant). 

  



  

  Section 6.16 __Leasehold  Mortgages_._ The Company and its Subsidiaries 
will cooperate, and use their respective reasonable best efforts  to cause
the applicable landlords to cooperate, to the extent  that any Lease requires
modification in order to permit such  Lease to be mortgaged in connection
with the Debt Financing. 

  



  

  Section 6.17 __FIRPTA  Certificate_._ Prior to the Acceptance Time,  the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver  to Parent an
executed affidavit, in accordance with Treasury  Regulation  Section
1.897-2(h)  certifying that an interest in the Company is not a United 
States real property interest within the meaning of  Section 897(c) of the
Code and that sets forth the  Companys name, address, and taxpayer
identification number. 

  



  

  Section 6.18 __NASDAQ  Delisting and Deregistration_._ Prior to the 
Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall  use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,  all actions, and do
or cause to be done all things, reasonably  necessary, proper or advisable on
its part under applicable Law  and rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause the
delisting of the  Company and the Common Shares from NASDAQ as promptly as 
practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of  the Common
Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as  practicable after such
delisting. 

  



  

  Section 6.19 __Rule 14d-10(d)  Matters_._ Prior to the Acceptance Time and
to  the extent permitted by Law, the Company (acting through the  Company
Board, compensation committee or its Independent  Directors, to the extent
required) will take all such steps as  may be required to cause each
agreement, arrangement or  understanding as may be entered into by the
Company or its  Subsidiaries on or after the date hereof with any officer, 
director or employee that holds Common Shares pursuant to which  compensation
is paid to such officer, director or employee to be  approved as an
"employment compensation, severance or other  employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of  Rule 14d-10(d)(1)  under the Exchange Act and to
otherwise satisfy the requirements  of the non-exclusive safe harbor set
forth in  Rule 14d-10(d)  under the Exchange Act.

  former, current and future direct or indirect equity holders,  controlling

_Section 8.3(c)_ or, without duplication, pursuant to  the Limited Guarantee,

Agreement, the Limited  Guarantee, the Equity Commitment Letter, in respect
of any oral  representations made or alleged to be made in connection 
herewith or therewith, in respect of the transactions  contemplated hereby or

none of the Parent Related  Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation relating  to or arising out of this Agreement, the Limited

Parties shall  have any further liability or obligation relating to or

and their respective  successors and permitted assigns. 

  



  

  (g) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges  that (i) the
agreements contained in this  _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) each of the  Termination
Fee and the Reverse Termination Fee is not a  penalty, but is liquidated

and Merger Sub, and their  respective Affiliates, as the case may be, in the
circumstances  in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources 
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this  Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the  expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated  hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate  with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the 
parties would not enter into this Agreement. In the event that  the Company
shall fail to pay the Termination Fee or Expenses  when due or Parent shall
fail to pay the Reverse Termination Fee  when due, the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, shall  reimburse the other party for all reasonable Expenses
actually  incurred or accrued by such other party (including reasonable 
Expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and  enforcement

amendment shall be made which decreases the Per Share Merger  Consideration

amendment shall be made that  pursuant to applicable Law requires further
approval or adoption  by the stockholders of the Company without such further
approval  or adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or 
supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or  otherwise,
except by an instrument in writing specifically  designated as an amendment
hereto, signed on behalf of each of  the parties in interest at the time of
the amendment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Acceptance Time
and  prior to the Effective Time, any amendment to this Agreement  must be
approved by a majority of the Independent Directors (or  in the case where
there are two or fewer Independent Directors,  the 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  concurrence of one Independent Director), if such amendment  would
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the  rights of any
holders of Shares other than Parent or Merger Sub. 

  



  

  Section 8.5 __Extension  of Time; Waiver_._ At any time prior to the 
Effective Time, the parties may, by action taken or authorized  by their
respective Boards of Directors, to the extent permitted  by applicable Law,
(a) extend the time for the performance  of any of the obligations or acts of
the other parties,  (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and 
warranties of the other parties set forth in this Agreement or  any document
delivered pursuant hereto or (c) subject to  applicable Law, waive compliance
with any of the agreements or  conditions of the other parties contained

approval or adoption  by the stockholders of the Company without such further
approval  or adoption. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such 
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument  executed and
delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of  such party. No failure
or delay of any party in exercising any  right or remedy hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor  shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right or power,  or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such  right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other
or  further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or  power.
The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are  cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which  they would otherwise have
hereunder.

  Section 9.10 __Enforcement_._ 

  



  

  (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur  in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement to be  performed by Parent, the
Company or any of their respective  Subsidiaries were not performed in
accordance with their  specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Accordingly, prior to  any termination of this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 8.1_, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub (as  applicable) shall be
entitled to specific performance of the  terms hereof, including an
injunction or injunctions to prevent  breaches of this Agreement by the other
(as applicable) and to  enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement  in the Chosen Courts, this being in addition to any other remedy 
to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. The  Company, Parent and
Merger Sub each hereby further waives  (i) any defense in any action for
specific performance that  a remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any
requirement  under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining 
equitable relief. 

  



  

  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Agreement, including
_Section 9.10(a)_, it is  explicitly agreed that the Company shall be
entitled to seek  specific performance of Parents obligation to cause the 
Cash Equity to be funded to fund the Offer and the Merger and to  consummate
the Offer and the Merger, as applicable, only in the  event that (i) (A) with
respect to the Offer, all of the  Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied
or waived as of the  expiration of the Offer and (B) with respect to the
Merger,  all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and,  if the Offer
Termination shall have occurred, all of the  conditions set forth in Section
7.2, shall have been  satisfied or waived as of the time when the Closing
would have  occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_ but for the failure  of the
Cash Equity to be funded, (ii) the Debt Financing  has been funded or will be
funded at or promptly after the  Acceptance Time or at or prior to the
Closing, as applicable, if  the Cash Equity is funded at such time in
accordance with the  Equity Commitment Letter, (iii) Parent and Merger Sub
fail  to consummate the Offer or effect the Closing in accordance with 
_Sections 1.1(c)_ or _2.2_ , respectively and  (iv) with respect to the
Merger, the Company has  irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance
is granted  and the Cash Equity and Debt Financing are funded, then the 
Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event  shall the
Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce  specifically Parents
obligation to cause the Cash Equity  to be funded or to consummate the Offer
or the Merger if the  Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be
funded at or  promptly after the Acceptance Time or at or prior to the 
Closing, as applicable, if the Cash Equity is funded at such  time). Each of
the parties agrees that it will not oppose the  granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other  equitable relief when expressly available
pursuant to the terms  of this Agreement on the basis that the other parties
have an  adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is  not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any  party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches  of this Agreement when
expressly available pursuant to the terms  of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and  provisions of this Agreement when expressly
available pursuant  to the terms of this Agreement shall not be required to
provide  any bond or other security in connection with any such order or 
injunction. If a Chosen Court has declined to specifically  enforce the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate  the Offer or the Merger
pursuant to a claim for specific  performance brought against Parent and
Merger Sub pursuant to  this _Section 9.10(b)_ but the standards set forth
in  this _Section 9.10(b)_ for the Companys  entitlement to such specific
performance have been met and would  otherwise entitle the Company to such
specific performance,  then, and solely in such event, the Company shall be
entitled  to, and Parent and Merger Sub shall pay to the Company, the 
Reverse Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practicable  following the
two (2) week period in the proviso below  (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days of such  two (2) week period), payable by wire transfer of
readily  available funds; _provided_ , that if a Chosen Court has  granted
an award of damages, the Company may enforce such award  and accept damages
up to the amount of the Reverse Termination  Fee only if, within two (2)
weeks following such award,  Parent and Merger Sub shall not have not
consummated the Offer  (to the extent the Offer Termination shall not have
occurred)  and the Merger. In addition, the Company agrees to cause any 
Action still pending to be dismissed with prejudice at such time  as Parent
and Merger Sub consummate the Offer (to the extent the  Offer Termination
shall not have occurred) and the Merger. For  the avoidance of doubt and
subject only to the possible  entitlement to specific performance as set
forth in this  _Section 9.10_, in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub  or any
Parent Related Party have any liability under or in  respect of this
Agreement, the Limited Guarantee, the Equity  Commitment Letter, the Debt
Commitment Letter or in respect of  any oral representations made or alleged
to be made in  connection herewith or therewith or in respect of the 
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in excess of an  aggregate amount
equal to the Reverse Termination Fee. The  provisions of this 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  _Section 9.10(b)_ shall be enforceable by each Parent  Related Party, each
of its Affiliates and their respective  successors and permitted assigns. 

  



  

  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Agreement, except as
and to the extent expressly permitted by  _Section 9.10(b)_, the parties
acknowledge that the  Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to  prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub
or  any remedy to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of  this
Agreement and that the Companys sole and exclusive  remedies with respect to
any such breach shall be the remedies  set forth in _Section 8.3(f)_. 

  



  

  Section 9.11 __Currency_._ All  references to "dollars" or "$" or  "US$"
in this Agreement refer to United States  dollars, which is the currency used
for all purposes in this  Agreement. 

  



  

  Section 9.12 __Severability_._ Whenever  possible, each provision or
portion of any provision of this  Agreement shall be interpreted in such
manner as to be effective  and valid under applicable Law, but if any
provision or portion  of any provision of this Agreement is held to be
invalid,  illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law 
or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or  unenforceability
shall not affect any other provision or portion  of any provision in such
jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall  be reformed, construed and enforced
in such jurisdiction as if  such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or portion of  any provision had never been contained herein. 

  



  

  Section 9.13 __Waiver  of Jury Trial_._ EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS 
AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY  IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR  RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE EQUITY COMMITMENT LETTER OR  THE LIMITED GUARANTEE OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR  THEREBY. 

  



  

  Section 9.14 __Counterparts_._ This  Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, all of  which shall be considered one and the same
instrument and shall  become effective when one or more counterparts have
been signed  by each of the parties and delivered to the other party. 

  



  

  Section 9.15 __Facsimile  Signature_._ This Agreement may be executed by 
facsimile signature and a facsimile signature shall constitute  an original
for all purposes. 

  



  

  Section 9.16 __No  Presumption Against Drafting Party_._ Each of  Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges that each party  to this Agreement
has been represented by counsel in connection  with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of Law or
any legal decision  that would require interpretation of any claimed
ambiguities in  this Agreement against the drafting party has no application
and  is expressly waived.

   EXHIBIT A 

  



  

   CONDITIONS  TO THE OFFER 

  



  

  Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Merger  Agreement,
Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for  payment or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of  the SEC, including  Rule 14e-1(c) 
under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs obligation  to pay for or
return tendered Common Shares promptly after the  termination or withdrawal
of the Offer), to pay for any Common  Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer
and, subject to the terms  of the Merger Agreement, may delay the acceptance
for payment of  or payment for Shares or amend the Offer, if at any
scheduled  expiration date of the Offer: 

  



  

  (a) there shall not have been validly tendered and not  withdrawn a number
of Common Shares that, together with the  Common Shares, if any, then owned
by Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries and the Support Agreement Shares, if
any, held in a  voting trust in accordance with a Support Agreement, would 
represent at least a majority of the outstanding Common Shares  on a fully
diluted basis on the date of purchase (which means,  as of any time, the
number of Common Shares outstanding,  together with all Common Shares that
the Company would be  required to issue pursuant to the conversion or
exercise of all  options, rights and securities convertible into or
exercisable  for Shares or otherwise, including after giving effect to 
_Section 3.2(a)_) (the " _Minimum  Condition_ "); 

  



  

  (b) the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or  foreign antitrust
filings in respect of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall
not have expired or been  terminated (or approval of the transactions
contemplated by the  Merger Agreement shall not have been obtained to the
extent  required under applicable foreign antitrust Laws); or 

  



  

  (c) any of the following conditions shall exist: 

  



  

  (i) there shall be pending any Action by any Governmental  Entity that
seeks, directly or indirectly, to (A) challenge  or make illegal or otherwise
prohibit, restrain or materially  delay the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger or any of the  other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, or to  make materially more costly the making of the Offer, or
to  obtain from the Company, Parent or Merger Sub any damages that  are
material in relation to the Company and its Subsidiaries  taken as a whole,
(B) to prohibit or limit the ownership,  operation or control by the Company,
Parent or any of their  respective Affiliates of any material portion of the
business or  assets of the Company, Parent or any of their respective 
Affiliates, or to compel the Company, Parent or any of their  respective
Affiliates to dispose of or hold separate any  material portion of the
business or assets of the Company,  Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates or (C) to  impose limitations on the ability of Parent to acquire
or hold,  or exercise full rights of ownership of, any Shares (or shares  of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation), including the  right to vote the
Shares purchased or owned by them on all  matters properly presented to
stockholders of the Company; 

  



  

  (ii) there shall be any Law enacted, entered, promulgated,  enforced or
deemed applicable by any Governmental Entity that  would, or would reasonably
be expected to, directly or  indirectly, result in any of the consequences
referred to in  _clauses (A)_ through _(C)_ of paragraph (c)(i) above; 

  



  

  (iii) since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall  have occurred
any event, change, development, circumstance,  occurrence, effect, condition
or state of facts that,  individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; 

  



  

  (iv) (A) the Company shall have breached or failed to  comply in any
material respect with any of its obligations,  covenants or agreements
contained in the Merger Agreement; (B)  (1) any of the representations and
warranties of the  Company set forth in _Sections 4.1_, _4.2_ ,  _4.4_ ,
_4.5(a)(i)_ or _(iii)_ , _4.9(b)_ ,  _4.20_ , _4.21_ , _4.22_ , _4.24_ or 
_4.25_ shall not be true and correct as of the date of the  Merger Agreement
or as of any scheduled expiration date of the  Offer as if made as of the
time of such determination (except to  the extent such representations and
warranties expressly relate  to an earlier date, in which case as of such
earlier date) or  (2) any of the remaining representations and warranties
of  the Company set forth in the Merger Agreement shall not be true  and
correct, without giving effect to any materiality or  "Material Adverse
Effect" qualifications or exceptions  contained in such representations and
warranties, except as,  individually and in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, in 

     ##### 

  

   

  each case, as of the date of the Merger Agreement or as of any  scheduled
expiration date of the Offer as if made as of the time  of such determination
(except to the extent such representations  and warranties expressly relate
to an earlier date, in which  case as of such earlier date); or (C) Parent
and Merger Sub  shall have failed to received a certificate of an executive 
officer of the Company, dated as of the scheduled expiration  date of the
Offer, to the effect set forth in the foregoing  _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ ; 

  



  

  (v) Prior to the purchase of Common Shares pursuant to the  Offer, the
Company Board shall have made an Adverse  Recommendation Change; or 

  



  

  (vi) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in  accordance with
its terms or shall have been amended in  accordance with its terms to provide
for such termination or  amendment of the Offer. 

  



  

  The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Merger Sub  and
Parent and may be asserted by Merger Sub or Parent  regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to such condition,  in whole or in part, at any
applicable time or from time to time  in their sole discretion prior to the
expiration of the Offer,  except that the conditions relating to receipt of
any approvals  from any Governmental Entity may be asserted at any time
prior  to the acceptance for payment of Common Shares, and all  conditions
(except for the Minimum Condition) may be waived by  Parent or Merger Sub in
their sole discretion in whole or in  part at any applicable time or from
time to time, in each case  subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement and  the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure
of  Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the  foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right  and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be  asserted at any time and from
time to time. 

  



  

  Capitalized terms used in this _Exhibit A_ and not  otherwise defined
shall have the respective meanings assigned  thereto in the Merger Agreement
to which this  _Exhibit A_ is attached (the " _Merger  Agreement_ ").
