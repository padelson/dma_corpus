    that Parent may most effectively access the financing markets.
    If, in connection with a marketing effort contemplated by the

    (b)&#160;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
    Agreement, including <U>Section&#160;9.10(a)</U>, it is
    explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek
    specific performance of Parent&#146;s obligation to cause the
    Cash Equity to be funded to fund the Offer and the Merger and to
    consummate the Offer and the Merger, as applicable, only in the
    event that (i) (A)&#160;with respect to the Offer, all of the

    has been funded or will be funded at or promptly after the

    irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted

    shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce
    specifically Parent&#146;s obligation to cause the Cash Equity
    to be funded or to consummate the Offer or the Merger if the
    Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at or
    promptly after the Acceptance Time or at or prior to the

    granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
    equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms
    of this Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an
    adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
    not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any
    party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
    of this Agreement when expressly available pursuant to the terms
    of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
    provisions of this Agreement when expressly available pursuant
    to the terms of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
    any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
    injunction. If a Chosen Court has declined to specifically

    the Offer or the Merger pursuant to a claim for specific
    performance brought against Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
    this <U>Section&#160;9.10(b)</U> but the standards set forth in
    this <U>Section&#160;9.10(b)</U> for the Company&#146;s
    entitlement to such specific performance have been met and would
    otherwise entitle the Company to such specific performance,

    to, and Parent and Merger Sub shall pay to the Company, the
    Reverse Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practicable
    following the two (2)&#160;week period in the proviso below
    (and, in any event, within two (2)&#160;Business Days of such
    two (2)&#160;week period), payable by wire transfer of readily
    available funds; <U>provided</U>, that if a Chosen Court has

    Fee only if, within two (2)&#160;weeks following such award,
    Parent and Merger Sub shall not have not consummated the Offer
    (to the extent the Offer Termination shall not have occurred)
    and the Merger. In addition, the Company agrees to cause any
    Action still pending to be dismissed with prejudice at such time

    or any Parent Related Party have any liability under or in
