WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent and Acquisition Sub have (i)

effectiveness of this Agreement, and which contains customary provisions that
require any counter-party(ies) thereto (and any of its (their) representatives
named therein) that receive material non-public information of or with
respect to the Company to keep such information confidential, _provided_ that
such confidentiality provisions are no less restrictive in the aggregate to
such counter-party(ies) (and any of its (their) representatives named
therein), and shall contain such other terms that are, in the aggregate, no
less favorable to the Company than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

thereof pursuant to applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall not (and Parent shall

(i) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A) Cancelled
Company Shares, and (B) any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without
interest thereon, upon the surrender of the certificate representing such
share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in _Section 3.8_ (or in
the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an
affidavit in the manner provided in _Section 3.10_).

(ii) _Excluded Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, or by any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, in each
case immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Cancelled Company Shares_
"), shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid therefor.

(iii) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Acquisition Sub that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.
Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of

of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the consummation of the Offer and prior to
the Effective Time.

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall have neither voted
in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have
properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal in respect
of such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ") shall not be converted into,
or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to 
_Section 3.7(a)_. Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive
payment of the appraised value of such

 



-25-  Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262
of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company
Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares
under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no longer be considered to be
Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced
such Company Shares in the manner provided in _Section 3.8_.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

(d) _Company Options_. Parent shall not assume any Company Options in
connection with the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, except as otherwise agreed to by Parent and a holder of a Company
Option, the Company shall take such action as may be necessary so that
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) the vesting of each Company
Option that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be accelerated in full, (ii) each Company Option that remains
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and terminated as of the Effective Time, and (iii) each holder of each
such Company Option shall be paid by the Company promptly after the Effective
Time, subject to _Section 3.8(e)_, an amount in cash (without interest), if
any, equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number
of Company Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _by_ (y) the Offer Price, _less_ the
per share exercise price of such Company Option (the " _Option Consideration_
") (it being understood and agreed that such exercise price shall not actually
be paid to the Company by the holder of a Company Option). The Company shall
take all actions necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this
_Section 3.7(d)_ under all Company Option agreements and any other plan or
arrangement of the Company, including delivering all required notices and
making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a
committee thereof. Within three (3) Business Days after the Closing, Parent
shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Surviving
Corporation, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each
of the holders of Company Options, the applicable Option Consideration (less
any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof) as promptly as
practicable (and in no event later than the next regular payroll date)
thereafter.

 

(e) _Company RSUs_. Parent shall not assume any Company RSUs in connection
with the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
except as otherwise agreed to by Parent and a holder of a Company RSU, the
Company shall take such action as may be necessary 

 



-26-  so that immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) the vesting of each
Company RSU that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be accelerated in full, (ii) each Company RSU that remains
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and terminated as of the Effective Time, and (iii) each holder of each such
Company RSU shall be paid by the Company promptly after the Effective Time,
subject to _Section 3.8(e)_, an amount in cash (without interest), if any,
equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of
Company Shares that were issuable upon settlement of such Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _by_ (y) the Offer Price (the " _RSU
Consideration_ "). The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by this  _Section 3.7(e)_ under all Company RSU
agreements and any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including
delivering all required notices and making any determinations and/or
resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof. Within three (3)
Business Days after the Closing, Parent shall pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Surviving Corporation, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each of the holders of Company RSUs,
the applicable RSU Consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes
payable in respect thereof) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later
than the next regular payroll date) thereafter.

 

3.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the holders of Company
Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_, an amount of cash
equal to the aggregate consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock
are entitled under this _Article III_. Until disbursed in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, such funds shall be invested by the
Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or
obligations of an agency of the United States of America which are backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States of America (such cash amount
being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. No investment
or losses thereon shall affect the consideration to which holders of Company
Common Stock are entitled under this  _Article III_ and to the extent that
there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or
the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the amount required to
promptly pay in full the cash amounts contemplated by this _Article III_,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make in full such
payments contemplated by this _Article III_.

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder
of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate
or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares and (ii)

 



-27-  uncertificated Company Shares (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each
case, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to  _Section 3.7_ (A) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Payment Agent), and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for
the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions
of this _Article III_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to
the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders
of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate
number of Company Shares represented by such Certificate that were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section
3.7_, by (y) the Merger Consideration (less withholding pursuant to _Section
3.8(e)_), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of
such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
aggregate number of Company Shares represented by such holders transferred
Uncertificated Shares that were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_, by (y) the Merger
Consideration (less withholding pursuant to _Section 3.8(e)_), and the
transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred
Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this  _Section
3.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Company Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered
in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of
the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered is
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment
has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares,
or established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent (or any agent
designated by Parent) that such transfer taxes have been paid or are otherwise
not payable.

 



-28- (e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Shares, Company Options and Company RSUs such amounts as are required
to be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Laws. To the extent
that such amounts are so deducted, withheld and remitted to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for
any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is nine (9) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company
Shares who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such Company Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger for exchange pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 3.8_ shall thereafter look for payment of
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Shares represented
by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent, as general
creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger Consideration to
which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article III_.

3.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ From and after
the Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder
of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any
Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender
thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.8_. The
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of the Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
III_.

3.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, in the form and
substance satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, and the posting by such
holders of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required
by Parent

 



-29-  as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to _Section 3.7_.

 

3.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. As of the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Acquisition
Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do,
in the name and on behalf of the Company and Acquisition Sub, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise
in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by
the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), or (ii) as
disclosed in any Company SEC Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the
Company between October 1, 2013 and the date hereof (other than in any "risk

and _provided_ that nothing in such Company SEC Reports shall be deemed to
modify or qualify the representations and warranties set forth in _Section

Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets
or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification (to the
extent the "good standing" concept is applicable), except where the failure to
be so qualified or in good standing would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is in compliance
with the provisions of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws in all
material respects. The Company has set forth in _Section 4.1(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter a true and complete list of each jurisdiction in
which it is qualified to do business.

this Agreement true and complete copies of (i) the Companys certificate of

Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

4.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. The Company has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its

any license or other right, title or interest in or to Intellectual Property
Rights (other than Contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business:

(d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries take reasonable steps to maintain
the secrecy of Confidential Information from which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries derive independent economic value, actual or potential, from the
Confidential Information not being generally known, except where any failures

Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have policies requiring each
employee and individual independent contractor who is involved in the
development of material Intellectual Property to execute one or more
agreements with provisions relating to the protection of the Companys
Confidential Information and assigning to the Company or a Subsidiary the
ownership of material Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights

independent contractors involved in the development of material Intellectual
Property have executed such agreement(s). To the Knowledge of the Company, no
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to
any agreement with any other Person which requires such officer or employee

-41-  Company Products and the conduct of the Companys or its Subsidiaries
business does not materially infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise
violate, and the Company Intellectual Property Rights do not conflict with,
the Patent Rights of a third Person (nor would they absent any applicable

1, 2012.

(f) Except as set forth on _Section 4.15(f)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, since January 1, 2010 through the date hereof, the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries has not received written notice of a claim, nor has any
Legal Proceeding been initiated asserting, that any Company Product or the
conduct of the Companys or its Subsidiaries business infringes upon,
misappropriates, or otherwise violates, or that the Company Intellectual
Property Rights conflict with, the Intellectual Property Rights of a third
Person, violates any rights to privacy or publicity or constitutes unfair
competition or trade practices under the Laws of any jurisdiction or any
notice that could be reasonably interpreted as such. To the Companys
Knowledge, no Person is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating
any Company Intellectual Property Rights (nor would they absent any applicable
infringement safe harbor). Except as set forth on _Section 4.15(f)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, since January 1, 2012 through the date hereof,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has asserted or threatened any

materially harm the business of the Company). The Company and its Subsidiaries

Company Intellectual Property Rights.

Rights owned by, or licensed to, any of them, (ii) any Person having the

under any of the Company IP Contracts. As used in this _Section 4.15(g)_, an
"incremental" right, non-compete, restriction, royalty or discount refers to
a right, non-compete, restriction, royalty or discount, as applicable, in
excess of the rights, non-competes, restrictions, royalties or discounts
payable that would have been required to be offered or granted, as

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any submission or suggestion to,

licensed to, any of them or which otherwise impairs or limits its control of
any Company Intellectual Property Rights, in each case under any Material
Contract.

monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis and reporting of clinical trials
contained in 21 C.F.R. Parts 50, 54, 56, 312, 314, and 320; and (iii)
material Laws restricting the collection, use or disclosure of individually
identifiable health information and personal information, except, in each
case, for such noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. No clinical trial of a Company Product conducted by or on behalf of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been terminated or placed on
clinical hold by a Governmental Authority prior to completion.

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all such Permits required under any
Healthcare Laws for the conduct of their respective businesses as currently
conducted in each jurisdiction in which the Company or its Subsidiaries
operate (collectively, the " _Healthcare Permits_ "), and all such Healthcare
Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to hold a
Healthcare Permit would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have fulfilled and performed all of their material obligations with respect
to each Healthcare Permit, and to the Knowledge of the Company, since November
1, 2011, no event has occurred which allows, or after notice or lapse of time
would allow, revocation or termination thereof or results in any other
impairment of the rights of the holder of any Health Care Permit , except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section 4.20(d) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any material written information from the FDA or any other
Governmental Authority which would reasonably be expected to lead to the
denial of any application for marketing approval or clearance currently
pending before the FDA or such other Governmental Authority.

 



-50- (e) Since November 1, 2011, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor to the Knowledge of the Company, any officer or employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has been (i) convicted of any crime that would
reasonably be expected to result in debarment under 21 U.S.C. Section 335a or
any applicable similar state or foreign Laws or (ii) excluded from
participation in any federal health care program, or convicted of any crime
that would reasonably be expected to result in such exclusion, under 42 U.S.C.
Section 1320a7, or in each case any applicable similar state or foreign
Healthcare Law.

(f) Since November 1, 2011, all material applications, reports documents, and
notices filed with or submitted to any Governmental Authority by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries were complete and accurate in all
material respects on the date filed or submitted (or were corrected in
or supplemented by a subsequent filing). To the Knowledge of the Company,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any officer, employee or
agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries, has made an untrue statement of a
material fact or a fraudulent statement to any Governmental Authority or
failed to disclose a material fact known to it, him or her required to be
disclosed to any Governmental Authority that, at the time such disclosure or
failure to disclose occurred, would reasonably be expected to provide a basis
for FDA to invoke its policy respecting "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material
Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities", set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191
(September 10, 1991), or for any other Governmental Authority to invoke any
similar policy or applicable non-U.S. equivalent thereof, except for any act
or statement or failure to make a statement that, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(g) Since November 1, 2011, the Company and its Subsidiaries have neither
voluntarily nor involuntarily initiated, conducted or issued, or caused to be
initiated, conducted or issued, any material recall or any material field
corrective action, market withdrawal or replacement, safety alert, warning,
"dear doctor" letter, investigator notice, or other notice or action to
wholesalers, distributors, retailers, healthcare professionals or patients
relating to an alleged lack of safety, efficacy or regulatory compliance of
any Company Product (each, a " _Safety Notice_ "), except for such Safety
Notices that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(h) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is, and at all times during the
last five (5) years has been, in compliance with the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or any rules or regulations thereunder, or
any comparable foreign Law or statute, except for such violations or
noncompliance that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any corporate
integrity agreements, monitoring agreements, deferred prosecution agreements,
consent decrees, settlement orders, or similar agreements with or imposed by
any Governmental Authority and, to the Companys Knowledge, no such action is
currently contemplated, proposed or pending.

 

4.21 _Environmental Matters_.

 



-51- (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries are, and since January 1, 2012 have been,
in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, which compliance
includes the possession and maintenance of, and compliance with, all Permits
required under applicable Environmental Laws for the operation of the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted, except for such
matters as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) To the Companys Knowledge, there are no actions, activities,
circumstances, facts, conditions, events or incidents, including the presence
of any Hazardous Substance, which would be reasonably likely to form the basis
of any material Environmental Claim against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or against any Person whose liability for such Environmental
Claims the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or may have retained or
assumed either contractually or by operation of Law.

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or is the subject of any pending, or to the
Knowledge of the Company threatened, Environmental Claim (except for such
matters as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect), and to the Knowledge of the Company, no such
Environmental Claim is pending or threatened against any Person whose
liability for such Environmental Claims the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has or may have retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of
Law.

(d) The Company has delivered or otherwise made available for inspection to
the Parent true, complete and correct copies and results of any reports, data,
investigations, audits, assessments (including Phase I environmental site
assessments and Phase II environmental site assessments), studies, analyses,
tests or monitoring in the possession or control of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pertaining to: (i) any unresolved Environmental Claims; (ii) any
Hazardous Substances in, on, beneath or adjacent to any property currently or
formerly owned, operated or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
or (iii) the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws, except in each case for such matters as would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

4.22 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Legal Proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, in either case, that would have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding Order that would have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.23 _Insurance_. The Company and its Subsidiaries have all material policies
of insurance covering the Company and its Subsidiaries, including policies of
life, property, fire, workers compensation, products liability, directors
and officers liability and other casualty and liability insurance, in forms
and amounts that are customarily carried by companies in the United States
conducting business similar to that of the Company and which the Company
believes is adequate for the operation of its business. All such insurance
policies are in full force and effect, no written notice of cancellation has
been received, and, to the Knowledge of the Company,

 



-52-  there is no existing default or event which, with the giving of notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, by any insured thereunder,
except for failures to be in full force and effect or such defaults that
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no material claim pending
under any of such policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied
or disputed by the underwriters of such policies and there has been no written
threatened termination of any such policies.

 

4.24 _Related Party Transactions_. Except for indemnification, compensation,
employment or other similar arrangements between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any director or officer thereof, on the
other hand, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no transactions,
agreements, arrangements or understandings between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Affiliate (including any director
or officer) thereof, but not including any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company, on the other hand, that would be required to be disclosed and is not
disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act in
the Companys Form 10-K or proxy statement pertaining to an annual meeting of
stockholders.

in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

4.26 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company Board has received the
written opinion of the Company Financial Advisor, financial advisor to the
Company, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon
and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in preparing such opinion
as set forth therein, the consideration consisting of $17.00 per Company Share
to be paid to the holders of Company Shares (other than holders of Cancelled
Company Shares, shares held by any Affiliate of Parent and Dissenting Shares)
pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.

4.27 _State Anti-Takeover Statutes_. Assuming that the representations of
Parent and Acquisition Sub set forth in this Agreement are true, accurate and
complete, the Company Board has taken all necessary actions so that the
restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL
and any other similar applicable Law are not applicable to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. No other state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation applies to or purports to apply to the Offer or
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. No "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover
statute or regulation or any anti-takeover provision in the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws is, or at the Effective Time will be,
applicable to the shares of Company Stock, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

respect to information supplied by or on behalf Parent or Acquisition Sub or
any of their directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents or
other representatives for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; _provided, however,_ that
at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company may waive or provide a
consent under any "standstill" solely to permit a party to make a
confidential Acquisition Proposal subject to the terms of, and only to the
extent permitted by, _Section 6.2_ if the Company Board reasonably determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the duties of the members of the Company Board under applicable Law
_provided_ that the Company shall not enforce and hereby waives any provision
of any such confidentiality or other agreements that would prohibit a Person
from requesting such termination, amendment, modification or waiver or from
communicating confidentially an Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board
(i.e., a "dont ask, dont waive" provision);

(xvi) take any action to exempt or make any person (other than Parent or
Acquisition Sub) not subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL or
any other potentially applicable anti-takeover or similar statute or
regulation;

 

(xvii) other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, enter into, amend or modify in any material respect any Material
Contract or Collective Bargaining Agreement; or

(xviii) enter into a Contract, or otherwise resolve or agree in any
legally binding manner, to take any of the actions prohibited by this
_Section 6.1(b)_.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement is intended to
give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time. Prior to the Acceptance 

 



-60-  Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
their own business and operations.

 

6.2 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than
Parent and Acquisition Sub) conducted heretofore with respect to any proposal
that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 6.2(c)_, at all times during the period commencing
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
IX_ and the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, nor
shall they authorize or knowingly permit any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, controlled Affiliates, or any investment banker,
attorney or other authorized agent or representative retained by any of them
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate or assist,
any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any designees of Parent or Acquisition Sub) any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to
any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any designees of Parent or
Acquisition Sub) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records
or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, in any such case with the intent to induce the making,
submission or announcement of, or the intent to encourage, facilitate or
assist, any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with any Person, or take any action, with respect to
any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal ( _provided, however_ , nothing contained herein shall
prohibit a first verbal interaction initiated by a Person on an unsolicited
basis so long as Oranges participation is solely to clarify the terms and
conditions of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal), (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal (except to the extent specifically permitted pursuant to
_Section 7.5(b)_), or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar
document, or any Contract or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to
an Acquisition Transaction (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement). The Company agrees that it shall, as soon as practicable following
the date hereof but in any event within two (2) Business Days, request of each
Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal to return all Confidential
Information furnished prior to the execution of this Agreement to or for the
benefit of such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or Representatives.

(c) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within forty-eight (48)
hours, following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information or inquiry which the Company reasonably believes would
lead to an Acquisition Proposal or for a waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with oral
and written notice of (i) the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal,

 



-61-  request or inquiry, (ii) the identity of the Person or group (as defined
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry and (iii) a copy of all written proposals provided by such
Person or group in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent informed as promptly as practicable
with respect to any changes to the material terms of an Acquisition Proposal
submitted to the Company (and in any event within forty eight (48) hours
following any such changes), including by providing a copy of all written
proposals relating to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
provide Parent with notice as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within the same day, of any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company
Board is reasonably expected to engage in material discussions regarding any
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 6.2_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company may
request clarifications from, participate in discussions or negotiations with
or furnish information to, any Person or group (as defined under Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act) (or its Representatives) in response to an unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal or written proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal if (A) such action is taken
subject to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) the Company
Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such actions would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
The Company shall promptly (and in any event within forty eight (48) hours)
following the provision of any non-public information of the Company to any
such person, provide such information to Parent (including by posting such
information to an electronic data room), to the extent such information has
not previously been provided or made available to Parent.

(e) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company agrees that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.2_ by any director, officer,
financial advisor or outside counsel of the Company (other than any such
Person who is an Affiliate or employee of Parent) shall constitute a breach
by the Company of this _Section 6.2_. Subject to _Section 6.1(b)(xv),_ the
Company shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
the provisions of any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement
entered into by it or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates
or Representatives, including, without limitation, where necessary, obtaining
injunctions to prevent breaches of such agreements and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereon in any court having
jurisdiction.

each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in
doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner

 



-62-  practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including

orders and authorizations from Governmental Authorities and make all
necessary registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental
Authorities, that are necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger; and

under any Material Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby so as to maintain and preserve the benefits
under such Material Contracts following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, neither Parent
or Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, shall
take any action ,or fail to take any action, that is intended to, or has (or
would reasonably be expected to have) the effect of, preventing, impairing,
delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger or the ability of such party to fully perform its obligations under
the Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company
shall not be required prior to the Effective Time to pay any consent or other
similar fee, "profit-sharing" or other similar payment or other consideration
(including increased rent or other similar payments or any amendments,
supplements or other modifications to (or waivers of) the existing terms of
any Contract), or the provision of additional security (including a guaranty)
or otherwise assume or agree to assume any Liability that is not conditioned
upon the consummation of the Merger, to obtain any Consent, waiver or approval
of any Person (including any Governmental Authority) under any Contract.

 

(b) Both Parent and Company agree, on behalf of themselves and their
Affiliates, that, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor Company shall, and neither Parent nor Company shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, enter into or consummate any agreements or
arrangements for an acquisition (via stock purchase, merger, consolidation,
purchase of assets or otherwise) of any ownership interest or assets of any
Person if such ownership interest or assets would reasonably be expected to
result in any delay in obtaining, or to result in the failure to obtain, any
regulatory approvals required under the HSR Act (including such agreements or
arrangements for an acquisition that would cause a delay with respect to the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods thereunder) in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger).

7.2 _Antitrust Filings_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall file
with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report
Form relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as
required by the HSR Act as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company shall
(i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of such filings,
(ii) supply the other with any information and documentary material that may
be required in order to make such filings, (iii) supply any additional
information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC or the
DOJ, and 

 



-63-  (iv) use reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable, and to avoid any impediment to the consummation of
the Offer or the Merger under any Antitrust Laws, including (1) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, a non-exclusive license or grant of commercialization
rights to businesses, product lines, fields of use, or assets of Parent or its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its
Affiliates), as needed to effectuate such non-exclusive license, (2) amending
any venture or other arrangement of Parent or its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates), and (3) otherwise taking or
committing to take actions after the Closing with respect to such non-
exclusive license, as may be required in order to enable the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, to occur as soon
as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the Termination
Date) and to otherwise avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any preliminary or permanent injunction which would otherwise have the effect
of preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger. Notwithstanding the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.2(a), Parent shall not be required to, and the Company shall not,
(i) consent to any hold separate order or divestiture, by itself or any of its
Affiliates, of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, (ii) consent to any exclusive license or exclusive
grant of commercialization rights or (iii) take any other action of the types
described above, including accepting or entering into any operational
restriction, consent decree, non-exclusive license, grant of commercialization
rights or make any undertaking as a condition imposed under an Antitrust
Law that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
(x) have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (y) a material adverse effect on
the Parent and its Affiliates, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the
Merger or (z) a material adverse impact on the benefit expected to be derived
by Parent and its Affiliates, taken as a whole, as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in _Section 7.1(a)_ or this
_Section 7.2(a)_ shall obligate Parent or the Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries to take any action or agree to any material Liability
that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
promptly inform the other of any communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection
with any filings or investigations with, by or before any Governmental
Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any proceedings initiated by a private party. If any party hereto or
an Affiliate thereof shall receive a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to which any such filings have been made, then such party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, to the extent reasonably practicable and
unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Authority, the parties hereto agree to (i) give each other reasonable advance
notice of all meetings with any Governmental Authority relating to the Offer
or the Merger, (ii) give

 



-64-  each other an opportunity to participate in each of such meetings, (iii)
keep the other party reasonably apprised with respect to any oral
communications with any Governmental Authority regarding the Offer or the
Merger, (iv) cooperate in the filing of any analyses, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or other written communications
explaining or defending the Offer and the Merger, articulating any
regulatory or competitive argument and/or responding to requests or
objections made by any Governmental Authority, (v) provide each other with a
reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider in
good faith the views of the other with respect to, all written communications
(including any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and
opinions) with a Governmental Authority regarding the Offer and the Merger,
(vi) provide each other (or counsel of each party, as appropriate) with
copies of all written communications to or from any Governmental Authority
relating to the Offer or the Merger, and (vii) cooperate and provide each
other with a reasonable opportunity to participate in, and consider in good
faith the views of the other with respect to, all material deliberations with
respect to all efforts to satisfy the conditions set forth in clauses (A) and
(C)(1) of _Annex A_ and _Section 8.1(b)_. Any such disclosures, rights to
participate or provisions of information by one party to the other may be made
on a counsel-only basis to the extent required under applicable Law or to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company.

 

(c) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one
another in good faith to (i) promptly determine whether any filings not
contemplated by _Section 7.2(a)_ are required to be or should be made, and
whether any other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations not
contemplated by _Section 7.2(a)_ are required to be or should be obtained,
from any Governmental Authority under any other applicable Law in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) promptly make any filings,
furnish information required in connection therewith and seek to obtain
timely any such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers that
the parties determine are required to be or should be made or obtained in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

7.3 _RESERVED_

 

7.4 _Merger_. Following the consummation of the Offer, each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate
actions to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after
the Acceptance Time, without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in
accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL and upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement. In furtherance, and without limiting the
generality, of the foregoing, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall, and
shall not permit and shall cause their respective Affiliates or
Representatives not to, take any action that could render Section 251(h) of
the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger.

7.5 _Company Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of _Section 7.5(b)_ and _Section 7.5(c)_, the
Company Board shall recommend that the holders of Company Shares accept the
Offer and tender their Company Shares to Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer
(the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ").

 



-65- (b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (x) withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or
qualify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Board Recommendation or (y) publicly approve, endorse or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal (each of clauses (x) and (y), a " _Company Board
Recommendation Change_ "); _provided, however_ , that a "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Company Board or any committee thereof to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any
substantially similar communication, shall not be deemed to be a Company Board
Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time, in response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal or an Intervening
Event, the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ if all of the following
conditions in clauses (i) through (iv) are met:

 

(i) A Superior Proposal with respect to the Company has been made and has not
been withdrawn or an Intervening Event has occurred;

 

(ii) The Company shall have (A) delivered to Parent written notice (a "
_Change of Recommendation Notice_ ") at least three (3) Business Days prior
to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, which notice shall
state expressly (x) that it has received a Superior Proposal or an Intervening
Event has occurred, (y) in the case of a Superior Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person
or group (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making the
Superior Proposal, or, in the case of an Intervening Event, the material
facts and circumstances related such Intervening Event, and (z) that it
intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ or effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change, and (B) in the case of a
Superior Proposal, provided to Parent a copy of all written proposals
provided by such Person or group in connection with such Superior Proposal (it
being understood and agreed that delivery of a Change of Recommendation Notice
shall not, by itself, be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change);

(iii) The Company Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

 

(iv) The Superior Proposal or Intervening Event that is the subject of the
Company Board Recommendation Change did not result from a material breach by
the Company of any of the provisions set forth in _Section 6.2_ or this
_Section 7.5_.

During such three (3) Business Days after delivering the Change of
Recommendation Notice, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (the " _Modified Terms_ "), and shall consider in good faith such
Modified Terms. In the event Parent proposes Modified Terms and
notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.5(b)_ to the contrary, the
Company Board may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(e)_ or effect a Company Board Recommendation Change unless and until

 



-66-  the Company Board concludes in good faith, after considering the Modified
Terms and consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.1(e)_ or to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to the
Company Stockholders that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ that,
in either such case, any such statement(s) or disclosures made by the Company
Board will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

7.6 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. None of the Company, on the one hand,
or Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue (or shall cause
its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives to issue) any public release
or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or
the rules or regulations of NASDAQ, the Tokyo Stock Exchange or
Governmental Authority to which the relevant party is subject or submits,
wherever situated, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or
parties hereto the reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement
in advance of such issuance (it being understood that the final form and
content of any such release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such
release or announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing
party); _provided, however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section
7.6_ shall not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be
made by the Company following a Company Board Recommendation Change.

7.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other
similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and Company Board
shall grant such approval and take such action as necessary so that such
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

7.8 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing on the date of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall afford Parent and its financial advisors, business consultants, legal
counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books
and records and personnel of the Company; _provided, however_ , that the
Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents
or information to the extent that (i) any applicable

 



-67-  Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such
documents or information, (ii) granting such access would violate any
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
confidentiality to any third party or otherwise breach, contravene or violate
any then effective Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party, (iii) access to such documents or information would give rise to a
risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information, or (iv)
access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default under, or give a
third party the right terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract;
and _provided further_ , that no information or knowledge obtained by Parent
in any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section 7.8_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or otherwise impair the
rights and remedies available to Parent and Acquisition Sub hereunder. In the
event that the Company does not provide access or information in reliance on
the preceding sentence, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that would not
violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or to waive such a
privilege. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by
this _Section 7.8_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the Companys
reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall not include
the right to perform invasive testing without the Companys prior written
consent, in its sole and absolute discretion. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information obtained by Parent or
any of its financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel,
accountants and other agents and representatives in connection with any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
7.8_. Nothing in this _Section 7.8_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Representatives of any of the foregoing to prepare any reports, analyses,
appraisals, opinions or other information.

 

7.9 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including "derivative
securities" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(c) under the Exchange Act)) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

7.10 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
shall (and, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries under (i) the indemnification agreements
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective current or former directors and officers and any person who
becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "), and (ii)
indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation

 



-68-  provisions in any certificate of incorporate or bylaws or comparable
organizational document of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect on
the date of this Agreement. In addition, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time to) cause the certificates of incorporation and
bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Acceptance Time to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of
expenses that are no less favorable than the indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses provisions contained in the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during such six (6)
year period, such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable Law or as
provided below.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of  _Section 7.10(a)_,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to) indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or
pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action
or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if,
at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting in good faith
a claim for indemnification under this _Section 7.10(b)_, then the claim
asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In
addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to) advance, prior
to the final disposition of any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry
for which indemnification may be sought under this Agreement, promptly
following request by an Indemnified Person therefor, all costs, fees and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses)
incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry upon receipt of an undertaking by such
Indemnified Person to repay such advances if it is ultimately decided in a
final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. In the event
of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the
Acceptance Time, (ii)

 



-69-  each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel,
whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of
any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (iii) the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained
by an Indemnified Person, promptly after statements therefor are received,
whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense
of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, and (iv) no
Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or
her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this _Section 7.10(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither
the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including Parent) shall
settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought by an
Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified
Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry.

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect
directors and officers liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by
the Companys currently in force directors and officers liability insurance
(" _Current Company D andO Insurance_"), on terms with respect to the coverage
and amounts that are no less favorable than those of the Current Company DandO
Insurance;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under
this _Section 7.10(c)_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
the amount paid by the Company for coverage during its current coverage
period (such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual
Premium_ "); _provided_ that, if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for the
Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six
(6) year "tail" prepaid policy on the Current Company DandO Insurance. In the
event that the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect
and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first
sentence of this _Section 7.10(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect.

 

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any of its
successors or assigns) (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this _Section 7.10_.

 



-70- 7.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the
Acceptance Time, as applicable.

(b) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
provide to each Continuing Employee (i) health and welfare benefits that are,
taken as a whole, substantially comparable in the aggregate to the health
and welfare benefits in effect for such Continuing Employee on the date of
this Agreement (ii) severance benefits no less favorable than the severance
benefits in effect for such Continuing Employee on the date of this Agreement
and (iii) base salary (or regular wages, as the case may be) and, to the
extent applicable, target bonus opportunity, at the level in effect as of the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ , however, that any such health and welfare
benefits and severance benefits must have been fully disclosed in writing at
least three (3) days prior to the date of this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, other types of compensation and benefits, including but not limited to
equity and equity-based compensation, are not included in or covered by the
provisions of this _Section 7.11(b)_.

(c) To the extent that an Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan or
other compensation or severance arrangement of the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries (together, the " _Company Plans_ ") or any employee
benefit plan or other compensation or severance arrangement of Parent is made
available to any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time solely for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits
where length of service is relevant for purposes of vacation accrual
and severance pay entitlement but excluding for the avoidance of doubt, for
purposes of any equity or equity-based awards or incentives granted after the
Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that such service need not be credited
to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
(or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee
benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company Plans) (such plans, collectively, the " _New Plans_
") to the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage under a
comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old
Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits to any Continuing Employee,
all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of
insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents during any unfinished portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket

 



-71-  requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan, and (iii) the accounts of such Continuing
Employees under any New Plan which is a flexible spending plan are credited
with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under the
applicable Company Plan.

 

(d) If so requested by Parent no later than ten (10) days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall terminate its 401(k) plan effective as of
the Effective Time, and no further contributions shall be made to such plan
following such date. The Company shall provide to Parent any required
documentation, including any resolutions authorizing such termination. If
Parent requests the Company terminate its 401(k) plan pursuant to this
_Section 7.11(d)_, Parent shall take all actions necessary so that, effective
as of the Closing Date, (i) Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
participant in Parents 401(k) plan and (ii) Parents 401(k) plan will accept
rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, inclusive of loans) from
the Companys 401(k) plan.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii)
require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Company Plan or
prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective
Time. The provisions of this _Section 7.11_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section
7.11_ shall create such rights in any such persons.

 

7.12 _Obligations of Acquisition Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary
to cause Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement before and after the Effective
Time, as applicable (including, with respect to Acquisition Sub, to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement).

7.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) At all times during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement
and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Acceptance Time, the Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent and Acquisition Sub upon becoming aware that any
representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement has become untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of the Company to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in any
such case if and only to the extent that such untruth or inaccuracy, or such
failure, would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby set forth in paragraphs (C)(2) and (C)(3) of _Annex A_ to
fail to be satisfied at the then scheduled expiration of the Offer; _provided,
however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of the Company 

 



-72-  set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent
and Acquisition Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and _provided
further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall apply to any information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section
7.13(a)_.

 

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective
Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that
any representation or warranty made by Parent or Acquisition Sub in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any
failure of Parent or Acquisition Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that
such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent and
Acquisition Sub to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) or the ability of Parent
and Acquisition Sub to fully perform their respective covenants and
obligations under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such
notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of Parent or Acquisition Sub set forth in this Agreement or the
conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to the parties
hereunder; and _provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to the
Company pursuant to this  _Section 7.13(b)_.

7.14 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any
litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its
directors (in their capacity as such) by any Company Stockholders (on their
own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such
stockholder litigation and shall consider Parents views with respect to such
stockholder litigation.

-75-  representative of such party or parties) to the other party or parties
hereto, as applicable, except (a) for the terms of _Section 7.6_, this

(i) The Company shall pay to Parent $90,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "),
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after demand by
Parent, in the event that: (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ as a result of the failure to satisfy

condition to the Offer set forth in clause (A) of Annex A is satisfied at the
time of such termination pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_, (y) the condition to
the Offer set forth in clause (C)(1) of Annex A is satisfied at the time of
such termination pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_, except where the failure to

Transaction referred to in clause (B) below and (z) the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ is then available to Parent);
(B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to such
termination of this Agreement, a Competing Acquisition Transaction shall have
been publicly announced or shall have become publicly disclosed and, in

within twelve (12) months following such termination of this Agreement, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with any third party that
effectuates a Competing Acquisition Transaction or a Competing Acquisition
Transaction is consummated. For purposes of the foregoing, a " _Competing

(50%)" and (ii) "less than eighty percent (80%)" shall be deemed to be
references to "less than fifty percent (50%)."

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant

that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one (1) occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable

times and the occurrence of different events.

(d) _Consequence of Non-Payment_. The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in _Section 9.4(b)_ an integral part of the transactions

suit, together with interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime lending
rate prevailing during the period as published in The Wall Street Journal.

 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. Except as expressly provided in _Section 3.8(d)_, all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar
Taxes incurred in connection with the transaction contemplated by this

of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time prior to the Effective Time by execution of an instrument in writing

shall be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of such Company
Stockholders under Delaware Law or the rules of NASDAQ, without such approval.

 

9.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent legally
allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or
parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the

 



-77-  benefit of such party or parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on
the part of a party or parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party or parties, as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this
Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right. The conditions to each
of the parties obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit

application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as

agree to negotiate in good faith in an effort to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable

will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent and/or Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective
covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement. The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand hereby agree not to raise
any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by such party (or parties), and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party
(or parties) under this Agreement.

applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits
itself and its properties and assets in any action or proceeding to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept or
does not have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or other
state court within the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute or
controversy arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
thereof; (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought, tried and
determined only in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if
