NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,

bound, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing) or (b) such other
date, time or place as agreed to in writing by the Parties. Notwithstanding
the immediately preceding sentence, if the Marketing Period has not ended at
the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE
V_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at
the Closing), then the Closing shall occur instead on the date following the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions that is the earlier to occur of (a)
any Business Day as may be specified by Parent on no less than two (2)
Business Days prior notice to the Sellers Representative and (b) the Business

Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective at the time when the Delaware Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at

of the DGCL (the " _Effective Time_ ").

Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall be amended and restated to read as the certificate of incorporation of

references to the Company, and as so amended shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to
_SECTION 4.9_).

 



 

 **SECTION 1.5** **_The Bylaws_**. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, (the "
_Bylaws_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law
(subject to _SECTION 4.9_), except that all references to Merger Sub in the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be changed to refer to the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

 **SECTION 1.6** **_Directors_**. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 **EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK**

 



 

 **SECTION 2.1** **_Effect on Capital Stock_**. Subject to _SECTION 2.2_ and
_SECTION 2.6_, at the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any holder of any capital stock of the Company, the
sole stockholder of Merger Sub or any other Person:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (x) Shares held in the Companys
treasury and not held on behalf of third parties (" _Treasury Shares_ ") and
(y) Shares owned by Stockholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand
for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Stockholders_
") with respect to such Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") and together with
the Shares referred to in clause (x), the " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be
converted into the right to receive the applicable Per Share Closing Merger
Consideration with respect to each such Share and any Additional Per Share
Merger Consideration in cash, without any interest thereon. At the Effective
Time, all of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled, shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the applicable Per Share Closing Merger
Consideration with respect to each such Share and any Additional Per Share
Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of the Excluded
Shares, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the
holder of any Dissenting Shares thereof may have under _SECTION 2.6_.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 2.2** **_Exchange of Shares_**.

 



 

(a) _Payment for Shares_. As soon as practicable after the date hereof (but in
no event more than ten (10) days after the date hereof), the Company, Parent
and the Sellers Representative shall provide any required "know your customer"
information to the Paying Agent and enter into the Paying Agent Agreement with
the Paying Agent. Within five (5) Business Days after the execution of the
Paying Agent Agreement, the Company shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each Stockholder (other than holders of Excluded Shares) a letter of
transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery of the consideration
payable in respect of the Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to such Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery to the Paying Agent of a
properly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal). Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) which are surrendered on or prior to the fifth (5th) Business
Day prior to the Closing Date by delivery to the Paying Agent of a properly
executed and completed Letter of Transmittal for such Shares shall be
cancelled, and each holder of such surrendered Shares shall be entitled to
receive, on the Closing Date, in accordance with the instructions provided by
such holder in the Letter of Transmittal, in exchange for such surrendered
Shares, an amount in cash, in immediately available funds and without any
interest thereon from the Paying Agent, equal to the _product of_ (A) the
number of such surrendered Shares held by such Stockholder _multiplied by_ (B)
the applicable Per Share Closing Merger Consideration with respect to each
such Share. Any Stockholder who has not delivered a duly executed and
completed Letter of Transmittal on or prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day
prior to the Closing Date shall, upon delivery to the Paying Agent of a
properly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal for Shares owned by such
Stockholder, be entitled to receive, within five (5) Business Days of the
delivery of such Letter of Transmittal, in accordance with the instructions
provided by such holder in the Letter of Transmittal, in exchange for such
surrendered Shares, an amount in cash, in immediately available funds and
without any interest thereon from the Paying Agent, equal to the _product of_
(A) the number of such surrendered Shares held by such Stockholder _multiplied
by_ (B) the applicable Per Share Closing Merger Consideration _plus_ any
Additional Per Share Merger Consideration that has become payable with respect
to each such Share. If a Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
Dissenting Stockholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262
of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Shares shall cease to
be Excluded Shares and shall be surrendered upon delivery to the Paying Agent
of a properly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal for such Shares,
such Shares shall be cancelled, and each holder of such surrendered Shares
shall be entitled to receive, within five (5) Business Days of the delivery of
such Letter of Transmittal, in accordance with the instructions provided by
such holder in the Letter of Transmittal, in exchange for such surrendered
Shares, an amount in cash, in immediately available funds and without any
interest thereon, from the Paying Agent, equal to the _product of_ (A) the
number of such surrendered Shares held by such Stockholder _multiplied by_ (B)
the applicable Per Share Closing Merger Consideration _plus_ any Additional
Per Share Merger Consideration that has become payable with respect to each
such Share. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable as Per
Share Closing Merger Consideration or Additional Per Share Merger
Consideration. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
_SECTION 2.2(a)_, each Share (other than Excluded Shares) shall represent for
all purposes only the right to receive, as provided by this Agreement and
without any interest thereon, the applicable Per Share Closing Merger
Consideration with respect to each such Share and any Additional Per Share
Merger Consideration, and shall have no other rights. At any time following
(i) as relates to the Per Share Closing Merger Consideration, the six (6)
month anniversary of the Effective Time or (ii) as relates to any Additional
Per Share Merger Consideration, the six (6) month anniversary of the Paying
Agents receipt of any such Additional Per Share Merger Consideration, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to holders of Shares (including all interest and income received by
the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and
thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Per Share Closing Merger
Consideration and Additional Per Share Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due delivery to the Surviving Corporation of a properly executed
and completed Letter of Transmittal for Shares owned by such holders.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Party or other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

(b) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Share is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for
transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the amount in cash, in
immediately available funds and without interest thereon, to which the holder
of such Share is entitled pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 2.3** **_Payments at Closing_**. At the Closing, Parent will make
(or cause to be made) the following payments:

 



 

(a) to the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account or accounts designated by the Paying Agent in writing no later
than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount equal to the
aggregate Per Share Closing Merger Consideration for all Shares (for the
avoidance of doubt, excluding Excluded Shares);

 



 

(b) to the Surviving Corporation, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account or accounts designated by the Company in writing no later

(c) to the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with wire instructions provided by the Escrow Agent, the Adjustment
Escrow Amount for deposit into the escrow account pursuant to the terms of the

the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement);

 



 

(d) to the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with wire instructions provided by the Escrow Agent, the Indemnity
Escrow Amount for deposit into the escrow account pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement (which Indemnity Escrow Amount and any interest accrued
thereon will be held and distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement);

 



 

(e) to the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with wire instructions provided by the Escrow Agent, the Special
Indemnity Escrow Amount for deposit into the escrow account pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement (which Special Indemnity Escrow Amount and any
interest accrued thereon will be held and distributed by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement);

 



 

(f) to the Sellers Representative, the Sellers Representative Expense Amount,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a segregated account
designated by the Sellers Representative in writing no later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Sellers Representative Expense
Account_ ") and to be disbursed solely in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement;

 



 

(g) on behalf of the Company, an aggregate amount equal to the Transaction
Expenses, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts

Transaction Expenses is owed, the amount of such Transaction Expenses and a
copy of the invoice related thereto, to the extent available; and

 



 

(h) on behalf of the Company, the amount payable to each counterparty or
holder of Indebtedness, in order to fully discharge such Indebtedness, in each
case, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated in the applicable Pay-Off Letter delivered by the Company
no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date or, if such
Indebtedness is not of a type where a Pay-Off Letter would be delivered, to
the account or accounts designated by the Company no later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 



       
 

 



 

The consideration paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this
_SECTION 2.3_ shall be deemed to be full payment and satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) held by each
Stockholder and the Company Stock Options held by each holder thereof (subject
to any other rights of such Persons under this Agreement, including the right
to any Additional Per Share Merger Consideration and any other rights under
_SECTION 2.4_, _SECTION 2.5_ and _SECTION 2.7_), and none of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall have any further responsibility or
liability with respect to the distribution or disposition of such payments due
at Closing (other than the Surviving Corporation in respect of amounts payable
to former holders of the Company Stock Options that are to be paid through the
Surviving Corporations payroll).

 



 

 **SECTION 2.4** **_Treatment of Outstanding Company Stock Options_**.

 



 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Parent shall not assume any Company Stock Options
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause: (i) each outstanding
Company Stock Option held by an individual who commenced employment with the
Company on or prior to September 1, 2015 to become one hundred percent (100%)
vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time; (ii) the portion of each
outstanding Company Stock Option held by an individual who commenced
employment with the Company after September 1, 2015 the vesting of which is
based at least partially on the cumulative return of invested capital to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company to become one hundred
percent (100%) vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time; and (iii) the
portion of each outstanding Company Stock Option held by an individual who
commenced employment with the Company after September 1, 2015 the vesting of
which is based solely the continued employment of the option holder to become
seventy-five percent (75%) vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time. At
the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option which is vested and
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, taking into account the
preceding sentence (each a " _Vested Company Stock Option_ "), shall be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive, subject to
_SECTION 2.8_, (i) a single lump sum cash payment (without any interest
thereon) (each, a " _Closing Option Payment_ "), payable through the Surviving
Corporations payroll from either the funds of the Surviving Corporation or
funds provided by Parent for such purposes, on or prior to the next regularly
scheduled payroll date of the Surviving Corporation that occurs after the
Closing, in an amount equal to the product of (A) the total number of Shares
subject to the Vested Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Closing Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Vested Company
Stock Option and (ii) a cash payment or payments (without any interest
thereon), which shall be paid through the Surviving Corporations payroll,
equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the Vested
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y)
the Additional Per Share Merger Consideration. All Company Stock Options that
are not vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time (after giving effect
to the acceleration contemplated by this _SECTION 2.4(a)_) shall be cancelled
without payment of consideration therefor. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary: (i) each Company Stock Option shall be cancelled at
the Effective Time, regardless of whether a Closing Option Payment is paid;
and (ii) the right of each holder of a Vested Company Stock Option to receive
the consideration contemplated by this _SECTION 2.4(a) _shall be conditioned
on such option holders execution and delivery to the Company of an Option
Cancellation Letter in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Restricted Stock_. Parent shall not assume any shares of Restricted Stock
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action necessary such
that the Restricted Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall become vested in accordance with _SECTION 2.4(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. After giving effect to the acceleration and lapse of
restrictions contemplated by _SECTION 2.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, each vested share of Restricted Stock shall be treated as a Common
Share to be converted in the Merger into the right to receive the applicable
Per Share Closing Merger Consideration with respect to each such Share and any
Additional Per Share Merger Consideration. Any share of Restricted Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not vested (after
giving effect to the acceleration and lapse of restrictions contemplated by
_SECTION 2.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) shall be forfeited at the
Effective Time.

 



 

(c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company and
the board of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions
and take such other actions as necessary or appropriate to implement the
provisions of this _SECTION 2.4_.

 



 

 **SECTION 2.5** **_Merger Consideration Adjustments_**.

 



 

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth the Companys good faith estimate of (i) Indebtedness as of the
close of business on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), (ii)
Cash as of the Reference Time (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), (iii) Working
Capital as of the Reference Time (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ ") and
(iv) Transaction Expenses as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the
" _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), in each case, prepared in accordance
with GAAP and consistent with the methodology set forth in _Annex C_ , which
statement shall include the Companys calculation of the Closing Merger
Consideration derived therefrom. The Estimated Closing Statement shall also
include details as to the allocation of the Closing Merger Consideration
entitled to be received in accordance with this Agreement by holders of each
of the Companys outstanding (1) Common Shares (including the Restricted
Stock), (2) Preferred Shares, and (3) Vested Company Stock Options (the "
_Closing Merger Consideration Schedule_ ") and Parent shall be entitled to
rely exclusively upon the Estimated Closing Statement in paying the Closing
Merger Consideration pursuant to _SECTION 2.3_. In connection with Parents
review of the Estimated Closing Statement, the Company shall (i) permit Parent
and its Representatives to have reasonable access to the books, records and
other documents (including work papers, schedules, financial statements,
memoranda, etc.) of, and shall reasonably cooperate with the Parent in seeking
to obtain work papers from, the Company that were used in connection with the
preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement and provide Parent with copies
thereof, in each case, as reasonably requested by Parent and (ii) provide
Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to the Companys employees
and accountants as reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, in each case, Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such
activities during normal business hours and in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiary; _provided_ , _further_ , that independent accountants shall not be
obligated to make any work papers available to the Parent and its
Representatives unless and until Parent and its Representatives have signed a
customary confidentiality and hold harmless letter relating to such access.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) No later than (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) a closing statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth the Surviving Corporations calculation of the Companys
Indebtedness as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the " _Closing
Indebtedness_ "), Cash as of the Reference Time (the " _Closing Cash_ "),
Working Capital as of the Reference Time (the " _Closing Working Capital_ ")
and Transaction Expenses as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the
" _Closing Transaction Expenses_ "), in each case, prepared in accordance with
GAAP and consistent with the methodology set forth in _Annex C_ , which
closing statement shall set forth the Surviving Corporations calculation of
the Closing Merger Consideration derived therefrom.

 



 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, upon reasonable advance notice, (i) permit the
Sellers Representative and its Representatives to have reasonable access to
the books, records and other documents (including work papers, schedules,
financial statements, memoranda, etc.) of, and shall reasonably cooperate with
the Sellers Representative in seeking to obtain work papers from, the
Surviving Corporation that were used in connection with the calculation of the
Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the Closing Working Capital and the
Closing Transaction Expenses and provide the Sellers Representative with
copies thereof, in each case, as reasonably requested by the Sellers
Representative and (ii) provide the Sellers Representative and its
Representatives reasonable access to Parents and the Surviving Corporations
employees and accountants as reasonably requested by the Sellers
Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each case, the Sellers
Representative shall conduct any such activities during normal business hours
and in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _further_ , that independent accountants shall not be obligated
to make any work papers available to the Sellers Representative unless and
until the Sellers Representative has signed a customary confidentiality and
hold harmless letter relating to such access. If the Sellers Representative
(on behalf of the Sellers) disagrees with any part of the Surviving
Corporations calculation of the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the
Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Transaction Expenses, each as set
forth on the Closing Statement, the Sellers Representative shall, within
thirty (30) days after the Sellers Representatives receipt of the Closing
Statement, notify Parent in writing of such disagreement by setting forth the
Sellers Representatives calculation of the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing
Cash, the Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Transaction Expenses, as
applicable, and describing the basis for such disagreement (an " _Objection
Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that any objections must be on the basis
that the calculation of the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the
Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Transaction Expenses, each as set
forth on the Closing Statement, (i) were not arrived at in accordance with
this Agreement or (ii) were arrived at based on mathematical or clerical
error. If the Sellers Representative fails to deliver an Objection Notice to
Parent within thirty (30) days after the Sellers Representatives receipt of
the Closing Statement, the Surviving Corporations calculation of the Closing
Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the Closing Working Capital and the Closing
Transaction Expenses, each as set forth on the Closing Statement, shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Parties for purposes of this Agreement. If an
Objection Notice is timely delivered to Parent, then Parent and the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve their disagreements with respect to the computation of the Closing
Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing
Transaction Expenses. Any item not specifically objected to by the Sellers
Representative in the Objection Notice shall be conclusive and binding upon
the Parties for purposes of this Agreement. In the event that Parent and the
Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) are unable to resolve all
such disagreements within thirty (30) days after Parents receipt of such
Objection Notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Parent and the Sellers
Representative shall submit such remaining disagreements to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or any other nationally recognized certified
public independent accounting firm as is reasonably acceptable to Parent and
the Sellers Representative (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm
shall have exclusive jurisdiction over, and resort to the Accounting Firm as
provided in this _SECTION 2.5_ shall be the only recourse and remedy of the
Parties against one another with respect to, any disputes arising out of or
relating to the adjustments pursuant to this _SECTION 2.5_.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, there are any
disagreements remaining with respect to the computation of the Closing
Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing
Transaction Expenses, Parent and the Sellers Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve all
such remaining disagreements as soon as practicable, but in any event shall
direct the Accounting Firm to render a determination within sixty (60) days
after its retention. The Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and
amounts in the Surviving Corporations and the Sellers Representatives
respective calculations of the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the
Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Transaction Expenses that are
identified as being items and amounts to which the Surviving Corporation and
the Sellers Representative have been unable to agree. In resolving any
disputed item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Party. The Accounting Firms
determination of the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the Closing
Working Capital and/or the Closing Transaction Expenses, as the case may be,
shall be based solely on written materials submitted by Parent and the Sellers
Representative ( _i.e._ , not on independent review) and on the definitions of
"Closing Indebtedness," "Closing Cash," "Closing Working Capital" and "Closing
Transaction Expenses" and the other relevant provisions of this Agreement. The
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Parties and shall not be subject to appeal or further review (absent manifest
error or fraud).

 



 

(e) The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in determining the Closing
Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing
Transaction Expenses, as the case may be, shall be borne by Parent, on the one
hand, and the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers and paid out of
the Sellers Representative Expense Amount), on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party
bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. For example, if Parent
claims the Closing Cash is $1,000 less than the amount determined by the
Sellers Representative, and the Sellers Representative contests only $500 of
the amount claimed by Parent, and if the Accounting Firm ultimately resolves
the dispute by awarding Parent $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and
expenses of the Accounting Firm will be allocated 60% ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 500) to
the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) and 40% ( _i.e._ , 200 ÷
500) to Parent. In connection with its determination of Closing Indebtedness,
the Closing Cash, the Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Transaction
Expenses, as the case may be, the Accounting Firm shall, pursuant to the terms
of this _SECTION 2.5(e)_, also determine the allocation of its fees and
expenses between Parent and the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers), and such determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Parties (absent manifest error or fraud).

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing
Cash, the Closing Working Capital and the Closing Transaction Expenses are
finally determined pursuant to this _SECTION 2.5_, the Closing Merger
Consideration shall be recalculated based on the formula set forth in the
definition of the Closing Merger Consideration, substituting the Closing
Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the Closing Working Capital and the Closing
Transaction Expenses for the Estimated Indebtedness, the Estimated Cash, the
Estimated Working Capital, and the Estimated Transaction Expenses respectively
(as so recalculated, the " _Final Merger Consideration_ ").

 



 

(i) If the Final Merger Consideration is less than the Closing Merger
Consideration, then, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of
the Final Merger Consideration pursuant to _SECTION 2.5(f)_, the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of Sellers) shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay
Parent an amount equal to such deficit first, out of the Adjustment Escrow
Fund and second, out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund but only after the
Adjustment Escrow Fund has been exhausted and third, solely at the option of
Parent, out of the Special Indemnity Escrow Fund but only after the Indemnity
Escrow Fund has been exhausted.

 



 

(ii) If the Final Merger Consideration is greater than the Closing Merger
Consideration (such excess, the " _Seller Adjustment Amount_ "), then, within
five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final Merger
Consideration pursuant to _SECTION 2.5(f)_, (x) Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, pay (subject to _SECTION 2.8_) to the Paying
Agent (on behalf of the Stockholders (other than any holder of Excluded Shares
at such time)) and (y) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (on behalf
of the holders of the Vested Company Stock Options) to pay (subject to
_SECTION 2.8_), from either its own funds or funds provided by Parent for
such purposes, an aggregate amount equal to the Seller Adjustment Amount (less
an amount equal to the portion of the Seller Adjustment Amount allocable to
the Excluded Shares (if any) at such time (other than Treasury Shares)) and
the Paying Agent (with respect to the Stockholders (other than any holder of
Excluded Shares at such time) and the Surviving Corporation (with respect to
holders of the Vested Company Stock Options), through its next regularly
scheduled payroll, shall distribute to each Seller (other than any holder of
Excluded Shares at such time) its applicable Pro Rata Percentage of the Seller
Adjustment Amount as Additional Per Share Merger Consideration. If a holder of
Excluded Shares subsequently becomes a Surrendering Stockholder, then Parent
shall pay (or shall fund to the Paying Agent and the Paying Agent shall pay)
such Surrendering Stockholder its portion of the Seller Adjustment Amount as
Additional Per Share Merger Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, a
Dissenting Stockholder (unless it, he or she becomes a Surrendering
Stockholder) shall not be entitled to receive any portion of the Seller
Adjustment Amount and shall only have the dissenters rights set forth in
_SECTION 2.6_.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) All payments to be made to Parent or the Sellers pursuant to this
_SECTION 2.5(f)_ shall (x) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be
treated by all Parties for Tax purposes as adjustments to the purchase price
and (y) be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated by Parent, the Paying Agent and/or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable. The obligations of the Sellers Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) described in this _SECTION 2.5(f)_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of Parent for any and all claims arising under this
Agreement with respect to this _SECTION 2.5(f)_. For the avoidance of doubt,
in no event shall the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) be
obligated to pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its Affiliates pursuant to
this _SECTION 2.5(f)_ an amount in excess of the sum of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, the Indemnity Escrow Amount and and the Special Indemnity Escrow
Amount.

 



 

(g) Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing
Cash, the Closing Working Capital and the Closing Transaction Expenses are
finally determined pursuant to _SECTION 2.5(f)_ (and after any payment to
Parent pursuant to _SECTION 2.5(f)(i)_), Parent and the Sellers
Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, to release and deliver (i) the portion of the remaining balance of
the Adjustment Escrow Fund (if any) allocable to the Stockholders (other than
any holder of Excluded Shares at such time) to the Paying Agent, (ii) the
portion of such remaining balance allocable to the holders of the Vested
Company Stock Options, to the Surviving Corporation and (iii) the portion of
such remaining balance allocable to the Excluded Shares (if any) at such time
(other than Treasury Shares), to Parent (or, if directed by Parent, to the
Surviving Corporation), in each case by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account(s) designated by the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent (as applicable) for such purpose. The Paying Agent shall
distribute to each Stockholder (other than any holder of Excluded Shares at
such time) its applicable Pro Rata Percentage of such remaining balance as
Additional Per Share Merger Consideration. The Surviving Corporation shall
pay, through its next regularly scheduled payroll after receipt of funds, to
each holder of the Vested Company Stock Options such holders applicable Pro
Rata Percentage of such remaining balance as Additional Per Share Merger
Consideration. If a holder of Excluded Shares subsequently becomes a
Surrendering Stockholder, then Parent shall pay (or shall fund to the Paying
Agent and the Paying Agent shall pay) such Surrendering Stockholder its
applicable Pro Rata Percentage of such remaining balance as Additional Per
Share Merger Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, a Dissenting
Stockholder (unless it, he or she becomes a Surrendering Stockholder) shall
not be entitled to receive any portion of such remaining balance and shall
only have the dissenters rights set forth in _SECTION 2.6_.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 2.6** **_Dissenting Shares_**. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the
right to receive the applicable Per Share Closing Merger Consideration and the
Additional Per Share Merger Consideration, and Dissenting Stockholders shall
instead be entitled to payment of the fair value of their Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective
Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each Dissenting
Stockholder shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Dissenting
Shares, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any such Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
Dissenting Stockholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262
of the DGCL, then the right of such Dissenting Stockholder to be paid the fair
value of their Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and
each such Dissenting Share shall be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the
applicable Per Share Closing Merger Consideration with respect to each such
Share and the Additional Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

 **SECTION 2.7** **_Contingent Consideration_**.

 



 

(a) _Contingent Consideration_. Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to
make additional payments to the Stockholders (other than any holder of
Excluded Shares at such time) and the holders of the Vested Company Stock
Options, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this _SECTION 2.7_.

 



 

(b) _Fiscal Year 2017_.

 



 

(i) Within ten (10) calendar days following the availability of preliminary
financial results for the Surviving Corporation for the fiscal quarter ended
September 30, 2017, Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) a
statement setting forth (A) Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve (12) month period
ending September 30, 2017 (the " _Q3 LTM Adjusted EBITDA_ ") and (B) the
calculation of the First Earnout Payment, if any (the " _First Earnout
Statement_ "). Within ten (10) Business Days following the date on which
Parent delivered the First Earnout Statement, Parent shall pay (or shall cause
to be paid), as Additional Merger Consideration, to the Sellers Representative
on behalf of the Stockholders (other than any holder of Excluded Shares at
such time) and the holders of the Vested Company Stock Options, the First
Earnout Payment, if any, (other than the portion allocable to any holder of
Excluded Shares at such time) pursuant to _SECTION 2.7(d)_.

 



 

(ii) Within ten (10) calendar days following the availability of preliminary
financial results for the Surviving Corporation for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2017, Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) a
statement setting forth (A) the preliminary calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (the " _Preliminary 2017 Adjusted
EBITDA_ "), (B) the calculation of the Total Preliminary Potential 2017
Earnout Payment, and (C) the calculation of the Preliminary 2017 Earnout
Payment, as described below, if any (the " _Preliminary 2017 Earnout
Statement_ "). If the product of (1) the Total Preliminary Potential 2017
Earnout Payment _multiplied by_ (2) seventy-five percent (75%) is greater than
the First Earnout Payment (such excess, the " _Preliminary 2017 Earnout
Payment_ "), then, within ten (10) Business Days following the date on which
Parent first delivered the Preliminary 2017 Earnout Statement, Parent shall
pay (or shall to be paid), as Additional Merger Consideration, to the Sellers
Representative on behalf of the Stockholders (other than any holder of
Excluded Shares at such time) and the holders of the Vested Company Stock
Options, the Preliminary 2017 Earnout Payment (other than the portion
allocable to any holder of Excluded Shares at such time) pursuant to _SECTION
2.7(d)_. If the product of (1) the Total Preliminary Potential 2017 Earnout
Payment _multiplied by_ (2) seventy-five percent (75%) is less than the First
Earnout Payment (such deficit, the " _First Earnout Overpayment_ "), then (x)
the Final 2017 Earnout Payment, if any, shall be offset by the First Earnout
Overpayment and (y) if there is no Final 2017 Earnout Payment, or if the Final
2017 Earnout Payment is insufficient to fully offset the First Earnout
Overpayment, the Final 2018 Earnout Payment, if any, shall be offset by the
First Earnout Overpayment (or any remaining portion thereof following any
offset against the Final 2017 Earnout Payment).

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Within ten (10) Business Days following the date on which the audit for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 for PRA Health Sciences, Inc. ("
_PRAHS_ ") and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) is
completed, but no later than March 31, 2018, Parent shall (or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative
(on behalf of the Sellers) a statement setting forth (A) Adjusted EBITDA for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (the " _Actual 2017 Adjusted EBITDA_
"), (B) the calculation of the Total Actual Potential 2017 Earnout Payment,
and (C) the calculation of the Actual 2017 Earnout Payment, if any (the "
_Actual 2017 Earnout Statement_ "). If an Earnout Objection Notice has not
been delivered in accordance with _SECTION 2.7(e)_, the Actual 2017 Earnout
Payment set forth in the Actual 2017 Earnout Statement shall be deemed to be
the Final 2017 Earnout Payment, and if an Earnout Objection Notice has been
delivered in accordance with _SECTION 2.7(e)_ with respect to the Actual 2017
Adjusted EBITDA, upon the final determination of the Actual 2017 Adjusted
EBITDA pursuant to _SECTION 2.7(e)_ (as so determined, the " _Final 2017
Adjusted EBITDA_ "), the Actual 2017 Earnout Payment shall be recalculated,
substituting the Total 2017 Potential Earnout Amount for the Total Actual
Potential 2017 Earnout Payment in the definition of "Actual 2017 Earnout
Payment" and such amount shall be deemed to be the Final 2017 Earnout Payment.
If the Final 2017 Earnout Payment is greater than the Preliminary 2017 Earnout
Payment, then within (1) three (3) Business Days following the determination
of the Final 2017 Adjusted EBITDA if an Earnout Objection Notice is delivered
pursuant to _SECTION 2.7(e)_, or (2) thirteen (13) Business Days following
the date on which Parent delivered the Actual 2017 Earnout Statement, if no
Earnout Objection Notice is delivered pursuant to _SECTION 2.7(e)_, Parent
shall pay (or shall cause to be paid), as Additional Merger Consideration, to
the Sellers Representative on behalf of the Stockholders (other than any
holder of Excluded Shares at such time) and the holders of the Vested Company
Stock Options, an amount equal to (x) the 2017 Earnout Shortfall (other than
the portion allocable to any holder of Excluded Shares at such time) _minus_
(y) the First Earnout Overpayment, if any, pursuant to _SECTION 2.7(d)_. If
the Final 2017 Earnout Payment is less than the Preliminary 2017 Earnout
Payment (such deficit, the " _Preliminary 2017 Earnout Overpayment_ "), then
the Final 2018 Earnout Payment, if any, shall be offset by the Preliminary
2017 Earnout Overpayment.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Fiscal Year 2018_.

 



 

(i) Within ten (10) Business Days following the date on which the audit for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for PRAHS and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) is completed, but no later than March
31, 2019, Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) prepare
and deliver to the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) a
statement setting forth (A) Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2018 (the " _Actual 2018 Adjusted EBITDA_ "), (B) the calculation of the
Additional Potential 2018 Earnout Payment and (C) the calculation of the
Actual 2018 Earnout Payment, if any (the " _Actual 2018 Earnout Statement_ ").

 



 

(ii) If an Earnout Objection Notice has not been delivered in accordance with
_SECTION 2.7(e)_, the Actual 2018 Earnout Payment set forth in the Actual
2018 Earnout Statement shall be deemed to be the Final 2018 Earnout Payment,
and if an Earnout Objection Notice has been delivered pursuant to _SECTION
2.7(e)_ with respect to the Actual 2018 Adjusted EBITDA, upon the final
determination of the Actual 2018 Adjusted EBITDA pursuant to _SECTION 2.7(e)_
(as so determined, the " _Final 2018 Adjusted EBITDA_ "), the Actual 2018
Earnout Payment shall be recalculated, substituting the Final 2018 Adjusted
EBITDA for the Actual 2018 Adjusted EBITDA and such amount shall be deemed to
be the Final 2018 Earnout Payment. Within (A) three (3) Business Days
following the determination of the Final 2018 Adjusted EBITDA if an Earnout
Objection Notice is delivered pursuant to _SECTION 2.7(e)_, or (B) thirteen
(13) Business Days following the date on which Parent delivered the Actual
2018 Earnout Statement, if no Earnout Objection Notice is delivered pursuant
to _SECTION 2.7(e)_, Parent shall pay (or shall cause to be paid), as
Additional Merger Consideration, to the Sellers Representative on behalf of
the Stockholders (other than any holder of Excluded Shares at such time) and
the holders of the Vested Company Stock Options, an amount equal to (1) the
Final 2018 Earnout Payment, if any, (other than the portion allocable to any
holder of Excluded Shares at such time) _minus_ (2) the First Earnout
Overpayment (or any remainder thereof), if any, _minus_ (3) the Preliminary
2017 Earnout Overpayment, if any, pursuant to _SECTION 2.7(d)_. Any portion
of the First Earnout Overpayment and/or the Preliminary 2017 Earnout
Overpayment that remains after such offset (or a determination that the Final
2018 Earnout Payment is not required to be paid) will be paid by the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) to Parent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by Parent, on the date
the Final 2018 Earnout Payment would have been made.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) With respect to any payment of the Contingent Consideration pursuant to
this _SECTION 2.7_, Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) pay (i) the portion of such Contingent Consideration allocable to the
Stockholders (other than any holder of Excluded Shares at such time) and the
portion of such Contingent Consideration allocable to holders of the Vested
Company Stock Options, to the Sellers Representative on behalf of such
Sellers, and (ii) the portion of such Contingent Consideration allocable to
the Excluded Shares (if any) at such time (other than Treasury Shares), to
Parent (or, if directed by Parent, to the Surviving Corporation), in each
case, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s)
designated by the Sellers Representative, the Surviving Corporation or Parent
(as applicable) for such purpose. At such time as the Sellers Representative
may determine, but no later than ten (10) Business Days after the Final 2018
Earnout Payment has been finally determined pursuant to this _SECTION 2.7_
(or a determination that the Final 2018 Earnout Payment is not required to be
paid), the Sellers Representative shall cause the Contingent Consideration
held by Sellers Representative on behalf of the Stockholders (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) and the holders of the Vested Company Stock
Options, less any portion of the First Earnout Overpayment and/or the
Preliminary 2017 Earnout Overpayment that is required be paid by the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) to Parent pursuant to _SECTION
2.7(c)_, to be paid to such Sellers by distributing amounts due to the
Stockholders to the Paying Agent and amounts due to the holders of Company
Options to the Surviving Corporation. The Paying Agent will distribute to each
Stockholder (other than any holder of Excluded Shares at such time) its
applicable Pro Rata Percentage of such Contingent Consideration as Additional
Per Share Merger Consideration. The Surviving Corporation shall pay, through
its next regularly scheduled payroll after receipt of funds, to each holder of
the Vested Company Stock Options its applicable Pro Rata Percentage of such
Contingent Consideration as Additional Per Share Merger Consideration. If a
holder of Excluded Shares subsequently becomes a Surrendering Stockholder,
then Parent shall pay (or shall fund to the Paying Agent and the Paying Agent
shall pay) such Surrendering Stockholder its applicable Pro Rata Percentage of
such Contingent Consideration as Additional Per Share Merger Consideration.
For the avoidance of doubt, a Dissenting Stockholder (unless it, he or she
becomes a Surrendering Stockholder) shall not be entitled to receive any
portion of such Contingent Consideration and shall only have the dissenters
rights set forth in _SECTION 2.6_.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Objection_. Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to),
upon reasonable advance notice, (i) permit the Sellers Representative and its
Representatives to have reasonable access to the books, records and other
documents (including work papers, schedules, financial statements and
memoranda) of, and shall reasonably cooperate with the Sellers Representative
in seeking to obtain work papers from Parent and the Surviving Corporation
that were used in connection with the calculation of the Actual 2017 Adjusted
EBITDA or the Actual 2018 Adjusted EBITDA and provide the Sellers
Representative with copies thereof, in each case, as reasonably requested by
the Sellers Representative and (ii) provide the Sellers Representative and its
Representatives reasonable access to Parents and the Surviving Corporations
employees and accountants as reasonably requested by the Sellers
Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each case, the Sellers
Representative shall conduct any such activities during normal business hours
and in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that independent accountants shall not be obligated to make any work papers
available to the Sellers Representative unless and until the Sellers
Representatives has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless
letter relating to such access. If the Sellers Representative (on behalf of
the Sellers) disagrees with Parents calculation of the Actual 2017 Adjusted
EBITDA as set forth in the Actual 2017 Earnout Statement or the Actual 2018
Adjusted EBITDA as set forth in the Actual 2018 Earnout Statement, as
applicable, the Sellers Representative shall, within ten (10) Business Days
after the Sellers Representatives receipt of such Earnout Statement, notify
Parent in writing of such disagreement by setting forth (in reasonable detail)
the Sellers Representatives objections (an " _Earnout Objection Notice_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that any objections must be on the basis that the
calculation of the Actual 2017 Adjusted EBITDA or the Actual 2018 Adjusted
EBITDA as set forth in the applicable Earnout Statement, (i) was not arrived
at in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) was arrived at based on
mathematical or clerical error. If the Sellers Representative fails to deliver
an Earnout Objection Notice to Parent within ten (10) Business Days after the
Sellers Representatives receipt of the applicable Earnout Statement, Parents
calculation of the Actual 2017 Adjusted EBITDA or the Actual 2018 Adjusted
EBITDA, as applicable, shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties for
purposes of this Agreement and shall be deemed to be the Final 2017 Adjusted
EBITDA or the Final 2018 Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, and Parent shall
proceed with the payment of the applicable Contingent Consideration pursuant
to this _SECTION 2.7_. If an Earnout Objection Notice is timely delivered to
Parent, then Parent and the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers)
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreements with respect to
the computation of the Actual 2017 Adjusted EBITDA or the Actual 2018 Adjusted
EBITDA, as applicable, set forth in the relevant Earnout Statement. Any item
not specifically objected to by the Sellers Representative in an Earnout
Objection Notice shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties for purposes
of this Agreement. If Parent and the Sellers Representative resolve all
disagreements, then the amounts agreed shall be deemed to be the Final 2017
Adjusted EBITDA or the Final 2018 Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable. In the event
that Parent and the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) are
unable to resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) days after
Parents receipt of such Earnout Objection Notice, Parent and the Sellers
Representative shall submit such remaining disagreements to the Accounting
Firm. The Accounting Firm shall have exclusive jurisdiction over, and resort
to the Accounting Firm as provided in this _SECTION 2.7_ shall be the only
recourse and remedy of the Parties against one another with respect to, any
disputes arising out of or relating to the adjustments pursuant to this
_SECTION 2.7_. Parent and the Sellers Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve all such
disagreements as soon as practicable, but in any event shall direct the
Accounting Firm to render a determination within sixty (60) days after the
submission of such disagreements to the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm
shall consider only those items and amounts in Parents and the Sellers
Representatives respective calculations of the Actual 2017 Adjusted EBITDA or
the Actual 2018 Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, that are identified as being
items and amounts to which Parent and the Sellers Representative have been
unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm may not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either Party. The Accounting Firms determination of the Actual 2017
Adjusted EBITDA or the Actual 2018 Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, shall be
based solely on written materials submitted by Parent and the Sellers
Representative ( _i.e._ , not on independent review) and on the definition of
"Adjusted EBITDA" included herein. The determination of the Accounting Firm
shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties and shall not be subject to
appeal or further review (absent manifest error or fraud) and the amounts
determined shall be deemed to be the Final 2017 Adjusted EBITDA and the Final
2018 Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable.

 



 

(f) _Fees and Expenses_. The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in
determining the Final 2017 Adjusted EBITDA or the Final 2018 Adjusted EBITDA,
as applicable, shall be borne by Parent, on the one hand, and the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers and paid out of the Sellers
Representative Expense Amount), on the other hand, based upon the percentage
which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to
the amount actually contested by such Party. In connection with its
determination of the Final 2017 Adjusted EBITDA or the Final 2018 Adjusted
EBITDA, the Accounting Firm shall, pursuant to the terms of this _SECTION
2.7_, also determine the allocation of its fees and expenses between Parent
and the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), and such
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties (absent
manifest error or fraud).

 



       
 

 



 

(g) _Treatment of Contingent Consideration_. The Parties acknowledge that the
amount of the Contingent Consideration has been negotiated by the Parties
based on their inability to agree as to the valuation of the Company as of the
Closing Date, and the amount of the Contingent Consideration that becomes
payable to the Sellers, if any, is intended by the Parties to be treated as
part of the purchase price and except to the extent that a portion of the
Contingent Consideration is required to be treated as imputed interest under
Section 1274 or Section 483 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations or
otherwise under applicable Law, the Parties will treat any such Contingent
Consideration as an adjustment to the purchase price for Tax purposes. The
Company, the Sellers and the Sellers Representatives agree not to take any
position, including for federal, state, foreign or local Tax purposes, that is
inconsistent with the intent expressed in this _SECTION 2.7(g)_.

 



 

(h) _Set-Off; Liability for Contingent Consideration_. In the event that at
any time any amount of the Contingent Consideration is required to be paid
pursuant to this _SECTION 2.7_, either (i) the amount of Losses claimed in
all pending claims for indemnification by the Parent Indemnified Parties
pursuant to _ARTICLE VII_ exceeds the amount of funds remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, or the Special Indemnity Escrow Fund, as applicable, or
(ii) the Indemnity Escrow Fund or the Special Indemnity Escrow Fund has been
depleted, as applicable, then Parent shall have the right to withhold and set
off against any such amount of Contingent Consideration due pursuant to this
Agreement, the amount of any Losses or other payments that the Sellers are
then required to pay to any Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to _ARTICLE
VII_. All of Parents and the Surviving Corporations and their respective
Affiliates obligations to make any payment of any Contingent Consideration
under this _SECTION 2.7_ shall be fully discharged when such payment is made
to the Sellers Representative and none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Affiliates shall have any responsibility or liability
for any payments due hereunder once such payments are made to the Sellers
Representative.

 



 

(i) _Assignment_. The rights of the Sellers under this _SECTION 2.7_ are
personal to the Sellers and notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, including the assignment provisions set forth in this _Section
2.7_, no rights or interest of the Sellers under this _SECTION 2.7_,
including any rights to receive any amount of the Contingent Consideration due
pursuant to this Agreement, may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged,
encumbered, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of, in whole or in part by the
Sellers (other than by operation of Law or the laws of descent) to any Person
and any attempted assignment, transfer or disposition shall be null and void.

 



 

(j) _Post-Closing Operation_. From and after the Effective Time and until
December 31, 2018, Parent shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to
assist the Surviving Corporation in achieving the aggregate Contingent
Consideration and shall not knowingly take (or knowingly cause any of its
controlled Affiliates to take) any action for the primary purpose of
preventing the achievement of the aggregate Contingent Consideration and shall
use commercially reasonable best efforts to operate the business in the
ordinary course until December 31, 2017. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent shall not (i) wind-down or liquidate the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiary, or (ii) cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiary, as a
stand-alone Person (and not as part of a sale of or merger, consolidation, or
other business combination or reorganization involving Parent or a sale of all
or substantially all of Parents business or assets), (A) to be sold to,
merged with or into or consolidated with any Person or (B) to sell all or
substantially all of its business or assets to any Person, in each case of (A)
and (B), other than Parent or an Affiliate of Parent.

(l) Subject only to the specific restrictions contained in _SECTION 2.7(j)_,

of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiary and their business, assets and
personnel with Parent and its Affiliates, (ii) Parent and its Affiliates shall

development, marketing and sale of its products and services), (iii) the
Contingent Consideration (including whether and the extent to which some or
all of it may be achieved) is speculative, and there is no assurance that the
Sellers will receive any Contingent Consideration, (iv) neither Parent nor any
of its Affiliates owe a fiduciary duty or express (except for obligations
expressly set forth in this _SECTION 2.7_) or implied duty to the Sellers,
the Sellers Representative or any other Person in respect of the Contingent
Consideration (and any such duty that may exist is hereby knowingly,
voluntarily and irrevocably waived), (v) the Parties solely intend the express
provisions of this Agreement to govern all of their rights and obligations
with respect to the Contingent Consideration, (vi) nothing herein will
prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates from engaging in any business or
opportunity either with or without the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiary
or acquiring, entering into joint ventures with, investing in or otherwise
cooperating with other Persons, including Persons that may have interests
adverse to or otherwise compete, directly or indirectly, with the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiary, (vii) nothing herein will prevent any
transaction involving the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiary, (viii) none
of Parent and its Affiliates is obligated at any time to lend, invest in,
contribute or otherwise provide any financing or other contributions, loans or

prohibit, prevent or otherwise restrict Parent or any of its Affiliates from
incurring any Lien with respect to the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiary, any equity interest therein or any asset thereof or otherwise
restrict the secured party in whose favor such Lien is granted from enforcing
its rights in respect of such Lien.

 



 

 **SECTION 2.8** **_Withholding_**. Each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, or anyone acting on their behalf (including the Paying Agent),
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and
withheld) from the consideration otherwise payable by it pursuant to this
Agreement to a Seller, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so withheld (or caused to
be withheld) shall be (a) timely remitted to the applicable Governmental
Entity and (b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid

 **SECTION 3.1** **_Representations and Warranties of the Company_**. Except
as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure
letter delivered by the Company to Parent simultaneously with entering into
this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

 



 

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets, to execute and
deliver this Agreement and other Transaction Documents to which it is a party
and to carry on its business as presently conducted. The Companys Subsidiary
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Delaware and has all requisite limited liability company power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as presently conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiary is
qualified to do business and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets or properties or the conduct of its business as presently conducted
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to constitute a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent complete and
correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
formation and governing documents) of the Company and its Subsidiary, each as
amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so made available is in
full force and effect in all material respects.

 



 

(b) _Subsidiary; Investments_. The Company does not have any Subsidiaries
other than Source Healthcare Analytics, LLC. The Company owns all of the

preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (a " _Preferred
Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Preferred Shares_ ," and together with the
Common Shares, the " _Shares_ "), of which 23,703,341 Common Shares are issued
and outstanding, including 23,422,000 shares of restricted Common Shares (of

Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Equity Interests.
Neither the Company nor its Subsidiary has agreed or is obligated to make any
future equity investment in or capital contribution to any Person. All of the

the Closing Merger Consideration entitled to be received in accordance with
this Agreement by holders of each of the Companys outstanding (1) Common

has approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Common Shares and the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Preferred Shares voting together as a single class is the only vote or consent
of the holders of any Equity Interests necessary to adopt this Agreement and

_Company Requisite Vote_ "). The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which the Company is a party, to perform its obligations

3.1(e)(i)_, a violation or breach under any Law or Order to which the Company
or its Subsidiary is subject, except in the case of _clauses (B)_ , _(C)_ and
_(D)_ , for any such breach, violation, default, termination, cancellation,
amendment, acceleration, loss of material benefit or creation that would not
reasonably be expected to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to
the Company and its Subsidiary, taken as a whole, or prevent or delay Closing.

 



 

(f) _Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 



 

(i) The Company has provided to Parent true, accurate and complete copies of
the following financial statements (the " _Financial Statements_ "): (A) the
audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its Subsidiary as of
December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (including the notes thereto, if any)

Transaction Documents to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party, by each of

documents of Parent or Merger Sub, each as amended to the date of this
Agreement, (B) any breach or violation of, or a default (or an event which

hereby.

 



 

(d) _Litigation_. There are no Actions (i) by or before any Governmental
Entity that are pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing

or that seek to prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the

Documents.

 



 

(e) _Debt Financing_.

 



 

(i) It is not a condition to Closing or any of Parents or Merger Subs
obligations under this Agreement, that Parent or Merger Sub obtain financing
(or obtain financing on terms acceptable to Parent or Merger Sub) for or
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has
delivered to the Company true, correct, and complete copies of an executed
commitment letter from the financial institutions identified therein, dated as
of the date hereof (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ", and the commitments
under the Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ "),
pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the
lenders party thereto (the " _Lenders_ ") have committed to lend the amounts
set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and has not been withdrawn, rescinded, or terminated, or
otherwise amended or modified (and no party thereto has indicated an intent to
so withdraw, modify or rescind) in any respect and is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto, including the Lenders, enforceable against Parent, and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto in accordance with their
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception. As of the date of this Agreement, other than as expressly
set forth in, or contemplated by, the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to
the fee letter referenced therein (a copy of all of which has been provided to
the Sellers Representative with only fee and other economic terms redacted) or
documentation relating to the joinder of additional commitment parties, there
are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Debt
Financing Commitments that could adversely affect the availability of the Debt
Financing or the timing of the Closing. As of the date of this Agreement, the
only conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the obligations of
the Lenders to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing Commitment are those
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under any
term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter, and, as of the date of this
Agreement, assuming the closing conditions set forth in _SECTION 5.1_ and
_SECTION 5.2_ have been satisfied and compliance in all material respects by
the Company with _SECTION 4.13_, Parent does not have any reason to believe
that it will be unable to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition of
closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, or that
the Debt Financing will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date. Parent
has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees or other
fees required by the Debt Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the
date of this Agreement. Assuming (A) the closing conditions set forth in
_SECTION 5.1_ and _SECTION 5.2_ have been satisfied, (B) compliance in all
material respects by the Company with _SECTION 4.13_, and (C) the Debt
Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, the
aggregate proceeds from the Debt Financing, together with immediately
available funds from Parent, will be sufficient to pay (1) the Per Share
Closing Merger Consideration for all Shares, (2) the Closing Option Payments,
(3) the Indebtedness set forth in the Pay-Off Letter, and (4) any and all fees
and expenses to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

 



 

(f) _Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists solely
of 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are
validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned directly or
indirectly by Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
effecting the Merger and has not engaged in any business activities or
conducted any operations other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(g) _Brokers and Finders_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled
to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Parent or Merger Sub for which the Company or any Seller would have any
liability if the Closing is not consummated.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) _Solvency_. Assuming that (i) the conditions to the obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger have been satisfied or waived, (ii)
the representations and warranties set forth in _SECTION 3.1_ are true and
correct in all material respects (for such purposes, without giving effect to
any "Knowledge" or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications or exceptions
therein), and (iii) the financial estimates, projections or forecasts provided
by the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof have been prepared in good
faith on assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, then immediately
after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and any indebtedness
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
any of them in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and the use of the proceeds thereof, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiary, will: (i) be able to realize upon its assets and pay its debts and
other liabilities as they become due; (ii) own property that has a fair
saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay its respective debts
and liabilities (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all
contingent liabilities); and (iii) not have unreasonably small amount of
capital to carry on its business. No transfer of property is being made and no
obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents with the intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent, including the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(i) _No other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in this _SECTION 3.2_, the Company acknowledges that
none of Parent, Merger Sub or nor any other person on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to Parent or Merger Sub or with respect to any other information
provided to the Company.

 



 

(j) Parent has conducted its own independent investigation, review and
analysis of the business, results of operations, prospects, condition
(financial or otherwise) or assets of the Company and its Subsidiary, and
acknowledges that it has been provided access to the personnel, properties,
assets, premises, books and records, and other documents and data of the
Company and its Subsidiary for such purpose. Parent acknowledges and agrees
that: (i) in making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, it has relied solely upon its
own investigation and the express representations and warranties set forth in
_SECTION 3.1_ of this Agreement (including the related portions of the
Company Disclosure Letter); and (ii) none of Sellers, the Company or any other
Person has made any representation or warranty as to Sellers, the Company or
its Subsidiary or this Agreement, except as expressly set forth in _SECTION
3.1_ of this Agreement (including the related portions of the Company
Disclosure Letter).

any Person other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates. To
the extent applicable, the Company shall immediately terminate any and all
negotiations or discussions with any third party regarding any proposal
concerning any Proposed Transaction and request in writing that all nonpublic

 **SECTION 4.3** **_Filings; Other Actions; Notification_** **.**

 



 

(a) The Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i)
obtain all governmental authorizations of any Governmental Entity that is or
may become necessary for their respective performance of their obligations
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) take all actions as may be requested by
any such Government Entity to obtain such authorizations. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing, each applicable party hereto agrees to
make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the
HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof

Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity with
any other person, and to the extent permitted by the Federal Trade Commission,
the Department of Justice or such other applicable Governmental Entity, give
the other Party the reasonable opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If any Governmental Entity shall have issued an Order or taken any other
action related to the Company or Parent or Merger Sub that would have the
effect of restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, then the Company or
Parent or Merger Sub (as the case may be) shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have such Order or other action declared ineffective as soon as
practicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall
Parent or any of its Affiliates be required to (i) defend, commence or
threaten to commence any lawsuits or legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative; (ii) agree to hold separate, divest, license or cause a third
party to purchase, any of the assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates; or (iii) otherwise agree to any
restrictions on the businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates in connection with this _SECTION 4.3_.

 



 

 **SECTION 4.4** **_Access and Reports_**. Subject to applicable Law, upon
reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiary to)
afford Parent, its Affiliates and their respective authorized Representatives,
reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the Pre-Closing
Period, to its officers, employees, consultants, accountants, properties,
Contracts and books and records, and, during such period, the Company shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiary to) furnish promptly to Parent information and
data concerning its business, operations, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested; _provided_ that Parent, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner
as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or its Subsidiary. All such information shall be governed by the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, neither the Company nor its Subsidiary will be required to
disclose any information to Parent or any of its Representatives if such
disclosure would: (i) based on advice of counsel, jeopardize any attorney-
client privilege; _provided_ , that the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much of it as
possible) in a manner that would not be reasonably likely to risk a loss of
such attorney-client privilege; or (ii) based on advice of counsel, contravene
any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or Contract entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall use its commercially
reasonably efforts to obtain the required consent of the counterparty under
such Contract to such access or disclosure. Prior to the Closing, without the
prior written consent of the Company (which consent may not be unreasonably,
withheld, conditioned or delayed), neither Parent nor its Representatives
shall contact any employee (other than individuals set forth on _SECTION 4.4_
of the Company Disclosure Letter) of, suppliers to, or customers of, the
Company or its Subsidiary regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

 **SECTION 4.5** **_Notification of Certain Events_**. Each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt written notice to the other Parties of
(a) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event causing any representation or
warranty to be untrue, or the failure to perform any covenant or agreement of
such Party, such that the corresponding closing condition contained in
_ARTICLE V_ would not be satisfied (assuming that the Closing were to occur
at such time), and (b) any failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _SECTION 4.5_ shall not (i) serve to cure such breach or non-
compliance or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the Party receiving such notice, (ii) constitute an acknowledgement or
admission of a breach of this Agreement or (iii) affect any of a Partys
rights hereunder, including any right to indemnification pursuant to _ARTICLE
VII_.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 4.6** **_Publicity_**. The initial press release in connection
with the announcement of this Agreement shall be mutually agreed by the
Company and Parent. None of the Company, the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates shall issue any press release or otherwise make any
public statement or respond to any media inquiry with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby either before or after the
Closing, without the prior approval of Parent, except, in each case, to the
extent a Party is ordered to make such disclosure by a court of competent
jurisdiction or is required to make such disclosure under applicable Law,
stock exchange regulations or applicable accounting standards.

 



 

 **SECTION 4.7** **_Employee Benefits_**.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the date that is the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
employees of the Company who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective
Time (collectively, the " _Affected Employees_ ") shall be provided with (i)
base salary or wages and target cash bonus and commission opportunities in the
aggregate which are no less than the aggregate base salary or wages and target
cash bonus and commission opportunities provided by the Company to each such
Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee
benefits (other than equity-based compensation) that are either (A)
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company to
such Affected Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, each such employee benefit is listed on _SECTION 3.1(i)(i)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter, or (B) substantially comparable to those
provided by Parent to its similarly situated employees.

 



 

(b) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and level and entitlement to benefits
(but not benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan), including the
determination of the level or amount of vacation and severance pay benefits
under the benefit and compensation plans, programs, agreements and
arrangements of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in which Affected Employees are eligible to participate following
the Closing (the " _Parent Plans_ "), Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall credit each Affected Employee with his or her years of service with the
Company and any predecessor entities, to the same extent as such Affected
Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such
service under any similar Company Plan or if no such Company Plan was in
effect, to the extent permitted under the applicable Parent Plan; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such service shall be credited to the extent that it would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. In addition, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i)
each Affected Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all Parent Plans, (ii) for purposes of each Parent
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Affected Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived for such Affected Employee and
his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable
or waived under the comparable Company Plans in which such Affected Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing, and (iii) for the plan year in
which the transfer to a Parent Plan occurs, the crediting of each Affected
Employee with any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid
prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable copayments,
deductibles or out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent Plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
_SECTION 4.7_ with respect to employees of the Company are included for the
sole benefit of the respective Parties and shall not create any right (i) in
any other person, including any employees or former employees of the Company
or any participant or any beneficiary thereof in any Company Plan or Parent
Plan or (ii) to continued employment with the Company, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. After the Effective Time, nothing contained in this _SECTION
4.7_ shall interfere with the right of the Company, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan or Parent Plan
(subject, in each case, to the provisions of this _SECTION 4.7_) or to
terminate the employment of any employee of the Company for any reason.
Nothing contained in this _SECTION 4.7_ shall be deemed to amend any Company
Plan or Parent Plan or to adopt a new benefit plan of any type.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall enter into transaction
bonus agreements with each of the employees listed in _SECTION 4.7(d)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter with the number of transaction bonus units set
across from such employees name, each in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
C_.

 



 

 **SECTION 4.8** **_Expenses_**. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement (including _SECTION 8.8_), whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be paid by the Party incurring such expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Parties agree that (i) the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy shall be paid fifty percent
(50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers as a Transaction
Expense (such Sellers portion, the " _Sellers  Share of __Representations
and Warranties Insurance Policy Cost_ "), (ii) the costs and expenses of the
Escrow Agent payable under the Escrow Agreement shall be paid fifty percent
(50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers Representative on
behalf of the Sellers (it being understood that the portion thereof payable by
the Sellers at the Closing shall be paid as a Transaction Expense), (iii) the
costs and expenses of the Paying Agent payable under the Paying Agent
Agreement shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%)
by the Sellers Representative on behalf of the Sellers (it being understood
that the portion thereof payable by the Sellers at the Closing shall be paid
as a Transaction Expense), and (iv) the costs and expenses for the Tail
Coverage shall be paid by the Sellers as a Transaction Expense.

 



       
 

 



 

 **SECTION 4.9** **_Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_**.

 



 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall not,
and shall not permit the Surviving Corporation to, terminate or repeal any
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto existing as of the date hereof in favor of any
current or former director or officer of the Company (collectively, the " _D
andO Indemnified Parties_") as provided in the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Company and the Surviving
Corporation or any indemnification agreement identified in _SECTION 4.9(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter between each DandO Indemnified Party and the
Company (collectively, the " _D andO Indemnification Arrangements_"), or amend
or otherwise modify any of the foregoing in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such DandO Indemnified Party without the
consent of such DandO Indemnified Party.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall obtain on behalf of the Company "tail"
insurance coverage with a claims reporting period of at least six (6) years
from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amount and
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the Company
and its directors and officers as the Companys existing policy providing
coverage for claims for directors and officers liability, employment practices
liability and fiduciary liability but only to the extent such claims are based
upon acts or omissions committed before or at the Effective Time (including in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (the " _Tail
Coverage_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the cost of such "tail"
insurance coverage would exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the current
annual premium paid by the Company for directors and officers liability
insurance, employment practices liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance (the " _Tail Insurance Cap_ "), then the length of the "tail" claims
reporting period to be obtained shall be the claims reporting period
reasonably available for a cost not to exceed the Tail Insurance Cap. The
Company shall bear the cost of the Tail Coverage, and such costs, to the
extent not paid prior to the Closing, shall be included in Transaction
Expenses. During the term of the Tail Coverage, Parent shall not (and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation not to) take any action following the Closing
to cause the Tail Coverage to be cancelled or any provision therein to be
amended or waived. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this _SECTION 4.9_ shall not be terminated or modified after the
Effective Time in such a manner as to adversely affect any director or officer
to whom this _SECTION 4.9_ applies without the consent of such affected
director or officer (it being expressly agreed that after the Effective Time
the directors and officers to whom this _SECTION 4.9_ applies shall be third-
party beneficiaries of this _SECTION 4.9_, each of whom may after the
Effective Time enforce the provisions of this _SECTION 4.9_). In the event
that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
_SECTION 4.9_.

 



 

(c) The Surviving Corporation and its respective successors or assigns shall
pay, to the extent required by the organizational documents thereof, the
reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this _Section 4.9_. The provisions of this _Section
4.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Closing and expressly are intended
to benefit each of the DandO Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, it is agreed that the rights of a DandO Indemnified Party under
this _SECTION 4.9_ shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, any
other rights such DandO Indemnified Party may have under the DandO Indemnification
Arrangements or otherwise, and nothing in this _SECTION 4.9_ shall have the
effect of, or be construed as having the effect of, reducing the benefits to
the DandO Indemnified Parties under such arrangements. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this _SECTION 4.9_, the Surviving Corporations
indemnification obligations under this _SECTION 4.9_ shall be limited to any
indemnification actually provided and funded under the Tail Coverage.

efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Documents, (ii) negotiate

all conditions applicable to Parent to obtaining the Debt Financing that are
within the Parents control. In the event that all conditions contained in the

Lenders to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative: (i) terminate the Debt Commitment Letter, unless the Debt
Commitment Letter is replaced in a manner consistent with the following clause
(ii); or (ii) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of, any
provision or remedy under, or replace, the Debt Commitment Letter if such
amendment, modification, waiver, or replacement (A) would (1) add any new
condition to the Debt Financing Commitment (or modify any existing condition
in a manner materially adverse to Parent) that would be reasonably expected to
materially and adversely affect (including with respect to timing)) the
ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents, or (2) be reasonably expected to make
the timely funding of the Debt Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Debt Financing materially less likely to occur, (B) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an amount such that the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Transaction Documents could not be consummated
or (C) would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

the foregoing, it is hereby understood and agreed that Parent may amend the
Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and provide such lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities with consent
rights with respect to existing conditions to the consummation of the Debt
Financing to the extent that the commitments in the aggregate of the lenders
to provide the Debt Financing are not reduced as a result of any such
amendment. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Sellers Representative copies
of any amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of any Debt Financing
Commitment or of any fee or other letter or agreement relating thereto. Upon
any such amendment, supplement, modification or replacement of the Debt
Financing Commitment in accordance with this _SECTION 4.13(b)_, the terms
"Debt Financing Commitment", "Debt Financing" and "Debt Commitment Letter"
shall mean the "Debt Financing Commitment", "Debt Financing" and "Debt
Commitment Letter" as so amended, supplemented, modified or replaced and the
term "Lenders" shall mean the lenders party to such Debt Commitment Letter as
so amended, supplemented, modified or replaced.

 



 

(c) In the event that any portion of the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent
shall: (i) promptly notify the Sellers Representative in writing of such
unavailability and, to the knowledge of Parent, the reason therefor; and (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, at its sole expense, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event and in any event no later
than the last day of the Marketing Period, alternative financing (in an amount
sufficient to enable the transactions contemplated hereby and by the
Transaction Documents to be consummated) from the same or other sources and on
terms and conditions no less favorable in any respect to Parent (including
with respect to the matters described in clauses (A), (B) and (C) of _SECTION
4.13(b)_) than such unavailable Debt Financing. For the purposes of this
Agreement, (A) the terms "Debt Commitment Letter", "Debt Financing Commitment"
and "fee letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar
agreement) or commitment or any fee letter referred to in such commitment
letter with respect to any alternative financing arranged in compliance with
this _SECTION 4.13(c)_ (and any Debt Commitment Letter, Debt Financing
Commitment and fee letter remaining in effect at the time in question), and
(B) the term "Lenders" shall mean the lenders party to such commitment letter
with respect to any alternative financing arranged in compliance with this
_SECTION 4.13(c)_ (and any lender party to the Debt Commitment Letter
remaining in effect at the time in question).

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Parent shall provide the Sellers Representative with prompt written notice
of (A) any breach or default by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Agreements of which Parent has knowledge or any termination of the
Debt Commitment Letter; or (B) any material dispute or disagreement between
Parent, on the one hand, and any Lender, on the other hand, with respect to
the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing
to be funded at the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will
Parent be under any obligation to disclose any information pursuant to clauses
(A) or (B) that is, based on advice of counsel, subject to attorney-client or
similar privilege if Parent shall have used its reasonable best efforts to
disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege. Parent
shall keep the Sellers Representative reasonably informed on a current basis
(and in any event at the Sellers Representatives reasonable request) of the
status of its efforts to consummate the Debt Financing.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives, to provide to Parent all cooperation
that is reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing,

participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, sessions with
rating agencies, roadshows, lender meetings or other customary syndication
activities (including customary one-on-one meetings); (ii) assisting with the
preparation of appropriate and customary materials for rating agency
presentations, bank information memoranda and similar documents reasonably
required in connection with the Debt Financing (including requesting any
consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to
the Debt Financing and the delivery of one or more customary representation or
authorization letters); (iii) facilitating the granting of Liens and pledging
of collateral, provided that no security interest or pledge shall be effective

(including corporate actions) will in each case not take effect prior to the
Closing and shall only be required by those directors, members and officers of
the Company that retain such positions as of the Closing; (vi) facilitating
the execution and delivery at the Closing of definitive documents (including
security documents) related to the Debt Financing on the terms contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter and which will become effective at or after the

connection with the Debt Financing that is not subject to the occurrence of
the Closing and (B) prior to the Effective Time, none of Company or its

any of their respective directors, officers or managers shall be obligated to
adopt resolutions or execute consents to approve or authorize the Debt
Financing or the execution of the Definitive Agreements prior to the Effective
Time (except that managers and officers of the Companys Subsidiary, to the
extent that such managers and officers remain in their positions after the
Closing, shall sign reasonably requested resolutions or consents that do not
become effective until the Effective Time); (B) no obligation of Company or
its Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives under any
certificate, document or instrument executed pursuant to the foregoing shall
be effective until the Effective Time; and (C) none of Company, its Subsidiary
or any of their respective Representatives shall be required to: (x) pay any

business of Company and its Subsidiary or conflict with or violate Companys
organizational documents or any applicable Law. Nothing contained in this
_SECTION 4.13_ or otherwise shall require the Company or its Subsidiary to be
an obligor with respect to the Debt Financing (that is not conditioned on the

incurred by the Company or its Subsidiary or their respective Representatives
in connection with such cooperation and shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Company and its Subsidiary and their respective Representatives for

therewith).

Shareholders Agreement and cause any Stockholder party thereto to execute and
deliver to the Company a written consent approving and adopting this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 4.15** **_Information Statement_**. Promptly, and in any event
within ten (10) days after the date hereof, the Company shall deliver to each
Stockholder who did not execute the written consent evidencing the Company
Requisite Vote the Information Statement, in form and substance reasonably

the material terms of this Agreement and the other relevant Transaction

defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive or retain any payments that
could, in the absence of such approval by the Stockholders, constitute "excess
parachute payments" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). Prior to
seeking such approval, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to seek and obtain waivers from the intended recipients of such
payments such that unless such payments are approved by the Stockholders to
the extent required by and in the manner that complies with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder,
the Company shall not be required to make such payments. Prior to seeking any
waiver or the Stockholders approval, the Company shall deliver to Parent
drafts of all waivers, consents and disclosures (including the underlying
documents described in the disclosures and the Section 280G analysis) prepared
in connection with the actions described in this _SECTION 4.16_ and Parent
shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on all such
documents (the Companys acceptance of Parents reasonable comments shall not
be unreasonably withheld).

 



 

 **SECTION 4.17** **_Ballard Litigation_**. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary provided herein:

 



 

(a) With respect to the Ballard Litigation, the Sellers Representative shall
have the exclusive right to manage, direct and control such litigation at the
sole cost and expense of the Sellers, including the selection of lead counsel
and any settlement, compromise or discharge thereof, except that the Sellers
Representative shall not have the right, without the express written consent
of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, to settle or compromise the Ballard Litigation if such settlement or
compromise (A) does not provide for a full release of the Company (or the
Surviving Corporation, if after the Closing Date) in connection with the
Ballard Litigation, or (B) imposes any liability or obligation on the Company
(or the Surviving Corporation, if after the Closing Date) other than the
payment of money damages that is fully indemnified hereunder and on which
payment is simultaneously made. In the event that the Sellers Representative
wishes to settle, compromise or discharge the Ballard Litigation after the
Closing Date and such settlement, compromise or discharge is not one which
would require the consent of Parent pursuant to the preceding sentence, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiary to execute any
documents reasonably necessary in connection such settlement, compromise or
discharge. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiary be required to pay any legal costs or other
costs of litigation relating to the Ballard Litigation (including in
connection with the defense thereof) and upon the Effective Time, the Sellers
Representative shall make provision to ensure that all such invoices and bills
are thereafter directed to the Sellers Representative.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall and after the Closing Date,
the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide reasonable
cooperation to the Sellers Representative and its Representatives in the
prosecution and defense of the Ballard Litigation. Such cooperation shall
include, without cost to the Sellers Representative, the retention and the
provision to the Sellers Representative and its Representative of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to the Ballard Litigation and the
making of the Representatives of the Company (or the Surviving Corporation, if
after the Closing Date) and its Subsidiary available to provide information,
testimony at depositions, hearings or trials, and such other assistance,
including fact-finding interviews, as may be reasonably requested by the
Seller Representative and its Representatives (provided that any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Representatives of the Surviving
Corporation in connection with the foregoing shall be paid from the Special
Indemnity Escrow Fund). The Sellers Representative and its Representatives may
make copies of any such records or information, which after the Closing Date
shall be at the sole expense of Sellers.

 



 

(c) The Parties agree that the cooperation set forth in this _SECTION 4.17_
is in the common interest of the Parties and is not intended to be and will
not act as a waiver of any applicable privilege.

 



 

(d) Any and all out of pocket fees, costs and expenses relating to or arising
out of the Ballard Litigation incurred by the Parent and/or the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiary reasonably necessary to further the prosecution
or defense of the Ballard Litigation (collectively, the " _Litigation
Expenses_ ") shall be reimbursed from the Special Indemnity Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Parent agrees to notify the
Sellers Representative in writing at least five (5) Business Days in advance
of incurring any Litigation Expense which alone or together with similar
Litigation Expenses is expected to exceed $5,000. If requested by the Seller
Representative following any such notice of Litigation Expense, Parent agrees
to meet and discuss such Litigation Expense with the Sellers Representative,
including whether such Litigation Expense is reasonably necessary to further
the prosecution or defense of the Ballard Litigation, in advance of incurring
such Litigation Expense.

 



 

 **SECTION 4.18** **_Tax Covenants_**.

 



 

(a) _Tax Returns_. At the Companys expense, the Parent shall prepare or cause
to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed (with the
determination of whether a Tax Return is timely filed including any extended
period of time to file Tax Returns granted under a timely filed extension
request) all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries that are filed
after the Closing Date. The Tax Returns for the taxable period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ") shall reflect all
deductions associated with the Transaction Expenses to the extent permitted
under applicable Law. All Tax Returns for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, as well
as Tax Returns for any taxable periods that begin before the Closing Date and
end after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Tax Period_ ") shall be prepared
consistently with the past practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law. The Sellers Representative shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent, at least five (5) days before payment of
Taxes (including estimated Taxes) is due to the relevant Taxing authority, all
Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (or portion thereof) or any portion of a Straddle Tax Period ending on
or before the Closing Date but in each case, only in excess of any Taxes taken
into consideration in calculating Closing Working Capital. The Parent shall
permit the Sellers Representative to review and comment on each Tax Return for
a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Tax Period prior to filing and consider
in good faith all such comments that are reasonable with respect to each such
Tax Return.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 



 

(i) The Parent, the Company and Sellers shall cooperate fully (and the Parent
and the Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to cooperate fully), as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, suit or proceeding, with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, suit or proceeding and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Parent, the Company, and
Sellers agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by another party, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Tax authority, and (B) to give the
other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
each other party, as the case may be, shall allow the requesting party to take
possession of such books and records. For clarity, in the case of any notice
required pursuant to this paragraph to be given to the Sellers, notice to the
Sellers Representative shall be sufficient.

 



 

(ii) The Parent and Sellers Representative further agree, upon request, to
cooperate fully to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to
the transactions subject to this Agreement).

 



 

(iii) The Sellers Representative further agrees to cooperate fully, upon
request of the Parent, to obtain and deliver to Parent any information
reasonably necessary to determine whether there has been an "ownership change"
within the meaning of Section 382(g) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (or any similar provision of state or local Law) prior
to the Closing Date.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) _Audits_.

 



 

(i) The Parent shall provide Sellers Representative with notice of any written
inquiries, audits, examinations or proposed adjustments by the IRS or any
other Tax authority, which relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods within 30 days of
the receipt of such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parents failure
to provide such notice to Sellers Representative shall not limit any
indemnification obligation of Sellers under _ARTICLE VII_ except to the
extent the Sellers are materially prejudiced by such failure. Sellers (through
the Sellers Representative) shall have the sole right to represent the
interests of the Company and each Subsidiary in any Tax audit or other
proceeding that solely relates to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and is reasonably
expected to increase any indemnification obligation of Sellers under _ARTICLE
VII_, to employ counsel of its choice at its own expense, and to settle any
issues and to take any other actions in connection with such proceedings
relating to such taxable periods; _provided_ that Sellers Representative shall
inform the Parent of the status of any such proceedings, shall provide the
Parent (at the Parents cost and expense) with copies of any pleadings,
correspondence, and other documents as the Parent may reasonably request,
shall consult with the Parent prior to the settlement of any such proceedings
and shall obtain the prior written consent of the Parent prior to the
settlement of any such proceedings, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _further_ that the Parent and
counsel of its own choosing shall have the right to participate in, but not
direct, the prosecution or defense of such proceedings at the Parents sole
expense.

 



 

(ii) The Parent shall have the right to control all other Tax audits or
proceedings of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Parent shall obtain the
prior written consent of Sellers Representative prior to the settlement of any
such proceedings that would increase any indemnification obligation of
Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 



 

(iii) The Parent and the Company shall execute and deliver (and the Parent and
the Company shall cause the Subsidiaries of the Company to execute and
deliver) to Seller such powers of attorney and other documents as may be
necessary or appropriate to give effect to the foregoing.

 



 

(d) _Tax Covenants_.

 



 

(i) The Parent covenants that without obtaining the prior written consent of
Sellers Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) it will not, and will not cause or permit the Company or its
Subsidiaries (or any Affiliate of the Parent), to (A) take any action on the
Closing Date or after the Closing other than in the ordinary course of
business that could give rise to any Tax liability of the Sellers or any
indemnification obligation of Sellers under _ARTICLE VII_ (except to the
extent contemplated by this Agreement) unless the Parent agrees to bear the
cost of any such Tax liability or indemnification obligation of Sellers
resulting from such action or (B) amend any Tax Return of a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Tax Period if such amendment would have the effect of
increasing the Tax liability of the Sellers or any indemnification obligation
of Sellers under _ARTICLE VII_.

 



 

(ii) After the Closing Date, the Parent and the Company will not (and the
Parent and the Company will not permit the Subsidiaries to), without obtaining
the written consent of Sellers Representative (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), agree to the waiver or any extension of the
statute of limitations relating to any Taxes of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or portion of a Straddle Tax
Period ending on the Closing Date with respect to which Sellers would have the
sole right to control under _SECTION 4.18(c)(i)_ in the event of an audit or
other proceeding.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Seller shall have the right to (A) any Tax refunds (net of any
applicable Taxes and any other reasonable third-party expenses or costs
incurred in connection with obtaining such Tax refunds) received by the
Company or any Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of any
Straddle Tax Period that ends on the Closing Date (except to the extent such
Tax refund results from the carryback to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or such
portion of any Straddle Tax Period of any Tax attribute of the Company or any
Subsidiary created in a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date) or (B) any credits against Taxes in lieu of refunds described in
clause (A). The Parent shall pay such amounts to Sellers Representative (for
further distribution among the Sellers) no later than 20 days after (1) in the
case of a refund, the actual cash receipt of such refund by the Company or its
Subsidiary or (2) in the case of a credit, upon filing a Tax Return on which
such credit actually reduces the amount of Taxes which otherwise would have
been payable by the Company or its Subsidiary (as if the Company and its
Subsidiary filed a separate Tax Return from Parent); provided that Parent
shall only be required to pay over a refund or credit to the Seller pursuant
to this _SECTION 4.18(d)(iii)_ to the extent Parent or its Subsidiaries
becomes entitled to such refund or credit prior to the first anniversary of
the date hereof. To the extent any such Tax refund or credit in lieu thereof
is subsequently disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable Tax
authority, the Sellers agree promptly to repay the amount of such Tax refund
or credit in lieu thereof, together with any applicable interest, penalties or
other additional amounts imposed by such Tax authority, to the Parent.

 



 

(iv) Unless required by applicable Law, Parent shall not, and shall cause the
Company and each Subsidiary not to, make any Tax election that has retroactive
effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including a Code Section 338(g)
election) or solely the portion of a Straddle Tax Period ending on the Closing
Date without the consent of Sellers Representative.

 



 

(v) If, as a result of a Tax audit or other proceeding, Closing Date NOLs are
reduced, then Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify the Parent or
Parent Affiliates (including the Company) for any Taxes or other Losses that
are owed by the Parent or Parent Affiliates (including the Company) as a
result of such reduction in Closing Date NOLs.

 



 

(e) _Straddle Tax Period Apportionment_. Where it is necessary for purposes of
this Agreement to apportion the Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for a Straddle Tax Period, such liability shall be apportioned
between the period deemed to end at the close of the Closing Date and the
period deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date
on the basis of an interim closing of the books, except that Taxes (such as
real or personal property Taxes) imposed on a periodic basis shall be
allocated on a daily basis.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 4.19** **_Record Retention_**.

 



 

(a) In order to facilitate the tax reporting or accounting preparation of the
Sellers with respect to such matters relating to the Company and its
Subsidiary prior to the Closing, or for any other reasonable purpose approved
in writing by Parent, for a period of five (5) years after the Closing, the
Parent shall:

 



 

(i) retain the books and records (including personnel files) of the Company
and its Subsidiary relating to periods prior to the Closing; and

 



 

(ii) upon reasonable advance notice, afford the Sellers Representative and its
Representatives reasonable access (including the right to make, at Sellers
Representatives expense, photocopies), during normal business hours, to such
books and records.

 



 

(b) In order to facilitate the tax reporting or accounting preparation of the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such matters relating to the Surviving

five (5) years following the Closing, Sellers Representative shall:

 



 

(i) retain the books and records (including personnel files) of the Sellers
Representative which relate to the Company and its Subsidiary and their
operations for periods prior to the Closing; and

 



 

(ii) upon reasonable advance notice, afford the Parent and the Company and
their Representatives reasonable access (including the right to make, at
Parents expense, photocopies), during normal business hours, to such books
and records.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent
nor Sellers Representative shall be obligated to provide the other party with
access to any books or records (including personnel files) pursuant to this
_SECTION 4.19_ where such access would: (i) based on advice of counsel,
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege; _provided_ , that the disclosing
Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access
in a manner that would not be reasonably likely to risk a loss of such
attorney-client privilege; (ii) based on advice of counsel, contravene any
applicable Law, fiduciary duty or contractual obligations of the disclosing
Party; or (iii) in the good faith judgment of the disclosing Party,
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the disclosing Party.

that is sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (taking into account any extensions thereof). The representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement (other than the Company Fundamental
Representations, the Company Tax Representations and the Parent Fundamental
Representations) and the related indemnification obligations of Sellers set
forth in _SECTION 7.2(a_) and of Parent set forth in _SECTION 7.3(a)_ shall
survive until the date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing
Date. None of the covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing Date, other than the provisions of _SECTION 4.1_,
_SECTION 4.5_, this _ARTICLE VII_ and _ARTICLE VIII_ of this Agreement and
those other provisions of this Agreement (including _SECTION 2.7_) which by
their terms contemplate performance after the Closing Date, which provisions
(other than _SECTION 4.1_ and _SECTION 4.5_) (and the indemnification
obligations of the Sellers set forth in _SECTION 7.2(b)_ and the
indemnification obligations of Parent set forth in _SECTION 7.3(b)_ arising
out of such provisions) shall survive for the period contemplated by their
respective terms or until all obligations thereunder have been fully
performed. The covenants set forth in _SECTION 4.1_ and _SECTION 4.5_ (and
the indemnification obligations of Parent set forth in _SECTION 7.3(b)_
arising out of such provisions) shall survive until the date that is eighteen
(18) months following the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the survival periods set forth in
this _SECTION 7.1_ constitute contractual statutes of limitations and any
claim brought by any Party pursuant to this _ARTICLE VII_ must be brought or
filed prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period with respect
to the provision upon which such claim is based.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 7.2** **_Indemnification by the Sellers_**. Subject to the other
terms and conditions of this _ARTICLE VII_, from and after the Closing, the
Sellers shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify Parent and Parents
Affiliates and Parents and Parents Affiliates respective Representatives
(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiary and their respective
Representatives, but excluding the Seller Indemnified Parties) (collectively,
the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against, and shall defend and
hold the Parent Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, any and all
Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, any Parent Indemnified Party
based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 



 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any provision of _SECTION 3.1_ (including
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty set forth in
_SECTION 3.1_);

 



 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by the Company, the Sellers or the Sellers Representative
pursuant to this Agreement; and

 



 

(c) the Special Litigation.

 



 

 **SECTION 7.3** **_Indemnification by Parent_**. Subject to the other terms
and conditions of this ARTICLE VII, from and after the Closing, Parent shall
indemnify the Sellers and Sellers Affiliates and Sellers and Sellers
Affiliates respective Representatives (excluding the Parent Indemnified
Parties) (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against, and shall defend and hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless
from and against, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed
upon, the Seller Indemnified Parties based upon, arising out of, with respect
to or by reason of:

 



 

(a) any inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of _SECTION 3.2_ (including
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty set forth in
_SECTION 3.2_); and

 



      
 

 



 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

 **SECTION 7.4** **_Certain Limitations_**. The Person or Persons making a
claim under this _ARTICLE VII_ is referred to as the " _Indemnified Party_ ,"
and the Person or Persons against which such claims are asserted under this
_ARTICLE VII_ is referred to as the " _Indemnifying Party_." Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the indemnification provided for
in _SECTION 7.2_ and _SECTION 7.3_ shall be subject to the following
limitations (subject to _SECTION 8.13_):

 



 

(a) Except in the case of Losses for breach of the Company Fundamental
Representations, the Company Tax Representations and Losses otherwise
indemnifiable pursuant to _SECTION 7.2(a)_ and resulting from the breach of
representations and warranties as to which coverage is expressly excluded
under the Representation and Warranties Insurance Policy (" _Uninsured R andW
Losses_"; provided that any matter that would otherwise be an Uninsured RandW
Loss because of such an express exclusion but which is covered by the Company
Tax Representations shall not be subject to the limitations herein on
Uninsured RandW Losses but shall be covered by the provisions relating to the
Company Tax Representations), in which case the following limitations shall
not apply, the Sellers shall not be liable to the Parent Indemnified Parties
for indemnification under _SECTION 7.2(a)_ and _SECTION 7.2(b)_ (solely with
respect to _SECTION 4.1_ and _SECTION 4.5_) until the aggregate amount of
all Losses in respect of such indemnification under _SECTION 7.2(a)_ and
_SECTION 7.2(b)_ (solely with respect to _SECTION 4.1_ and _SECTION 4.5_)
exceeds $2,650,000. Except in the case of the Company Fundamental
Representations, the Company Tax Representations and the Uninsured RandW Losses,
in which case the following limitations shall not apply, subject to _SECTION
7.5_, the maximum aggregate indemnification liability of the Sellers to the
Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to _SECTION 7.2(a)_ and _SECTION 7.2(b)_
(solely with respect to _SECTION 4.1_ and _SECTION 4.5_) shall not exceed
$2,650,000.

 



 

(b) Subject to _SECTION 7.5_, the maximum aggregate indemnification liability
of the Sellers to the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to _SECTION 7.2(a)_
for Uninsured RandW Losses, shall not exceed the Indemnity Escrow Amount.

 



 

(c) The maximum aggregate indemnification liability of the Sellers to the
Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to _SECTION 7.2_ shall not exceed the
amount of the Total Merger Consideration received by the Sellers.

 



 

(d) Except in the case of Losses for breach of the Parent Fundamental
Representations, in which case the following limitations shall not apply,
Parent shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnified Parties for
indemnification under _SECTION 7.3(a)_ until the aggregate amount of all
Losses in respect of such indemnification under _SECTION 7.3(a)_ exceeds
$2,650,000.

 



 

(e) The maximum aggregate indemnification liability of Parent to the Seller
Indemnified Parties pursuant to _SECTION 7.3_ shall not exceed the amount of
the Total Merger Consideration.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach and the amount
of any Losses that are the subject matter of a claim for indemnification, each
representation and warranty in this Agreement shall be read without regard and
without giving effect to the term "material" or "Company Material Adverse
Effect" or any similar phrase which has the effect of making such
representation and warranty less restrictive (as if any such word or phrase
were deleted from such representation and warranty), other than (i) the use of
the word "material" in the definition of Company Material Contract, (ii) the
failure to list items on the Company Disclosure Letter because of materiality
qualifications to the disclosure, (iii) the use of the word "material" in
_SECTION 3.1(f)(ii)_ with respect to Financial Statements, and (iv) the use
of the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" contained in _SECTION 3.1(g)_.
Solely with respect to the Company Tax Representations, for purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach and the amount of any Losses that
are the subject matter of a claim for indemnification, the Company Tax
Representations shall be read without giving effect to the exceptions for
items set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(g) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to _SECTION 7.2_ or _SECTION
7.3_ in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any Loss that
remains after deducting therefrom any proceeds actually received following
good faith and commercially reasonable best efforts for recovery by the
Indemnified Party (it being understood that the reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with seeking and obtaining
such recovery shall be includable in Losses) consisting of (i) insurance
proceeds (expressly including without limitation any proceeds of the
Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy, the use of which proceeds is
addressed by _SECTION 7.5_) and (ii) any indemnity, contribution or any other
payment or reimbursement actually received by the Indemnified Party in respect
of any such matter or claim, including, with respect to Parent, those
recovered by the Surviving Corporation after the Closing (collectively, the "
_Third-Party Recoveries_ "). Any Losses incurred by any Indemnified Party with
respect to any matter shall be calculated net of any Third-Party Recoveries.
If any Third-Party Recovery is actually received by any Indemnified Party
after an Indemnifying Party has made a payment to such Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _ARTICLE VII_, any such Indemnified Party shall promptly
remit such Third-Party Recovery to the applicable Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnified Party shall not be required to pursue recovery of any Third-Party
Recoveries.

 



 

(h) No Indemnified Party will be entitled to recover from any Indemnifying
Party for the same Losses more than once. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Parent Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to
indemnification under this _ARTICLE VII_ with respect to any Loss to the
extent such Loss would constitute a duplicative payment of an amount
specifically taken into account in determining any post-Closing adjustment,
including the adjustment under _SECTION 2.5_.

 



 

(i) Within ten (10) Business Days after the 18-month anniversary of the
Closing Date, Parent and the Sellers Representative shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, to release and deliver (i) the
portion of the remaining balance of the Indemnity Escrow Fund (subject to
outstanding claims for indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE VII_), if
any, allocable to the Stockholders (other than any holder of Excluded Shares
at such time), to the Paying Agent, (ii) the portion of such remaining balance
allocable to holders of the Vested Company Stock Options, to the Surviving
Corporation and (iii) the portion of such remaining balance allocable to the
Excluded Shares (if any) at such time (other than Treasury Shares), to Parent
(or, if directed by Parent, to the Surviving Corporation), in each case by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by
the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent (as applicable) for such
purpose. The Paying Agent will distribute to each Stockholder (other than any
holder of Excluded Shares at such time) its applicable Pro Rata Percentage of
such remaining balance as Additional Per Share Merger Consideration. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay, through its next regularly scheduled payroll
after receipt of funds, to each holder of the Vested Company Stock Options its
applicable Pro Rata Percentage of such remaining balance as Additional Per
Share Merger Consideration. If a holder of Excluded Shares subsequently
becomes a Surrendering Stockholder, then Parent shall pay (or shall fund to
the Paying Agent and the Paying Agent shall pay) such Surrendering Stockholder
its applicable Pro Rata Percentage of such remaining balance as Additional Per
Share Merger Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, a Dissenting
Stockholder (unless it, he or she becomes a Surrendering Stockholder) shall
not be entitled to receive any portion of such remaining balance and shall
only have the dissenters rights set forth in _SECTION 2.6_.

 



      
 

 



 

(j) Within ten (10) Business Days after the dismissal, settlement, issuance of
non-appealable orders or judgments or other termination or resolution of each
Special Litigation, including the full payment of all amounts owed in respect
of any judgment, settlement or otherwise to the counterparty to such Special
Litigation and to any Parent Indemnified Party and the full reimbursement of
the Litigation Expenses to the Parent Indemnified Parties, Parent and the
Sellers Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent, pursuant to
the Special Indemnity Escrow Agreement, to release and deliver (i) any amount
owed to any counterparty to the Ballard Litigation to the Sellers
Representative for the payment to such counterparty, (ii) if the MSA
Settlement has not occurred on or prior to the Closing Date, any amount owed
to any counterparty to the MSA Litigation to the Surviving Corporation for the
payment to such counterparty, (iii) the portion of the remaining balance of
the Special Indemnity Escrow Fund, if any, allocable to the Stockholders
(other than any holder of Excluded Shares at such time), to the Paying Agent,
(iv) the portion of such remaining balance allocable to holders of the Vested
Company Stock Options and the Restricted Stock, to the Surviving Corporation
and (v) the portion of such remaining balance allocable to the Excluded Shares
(if any) at such time (other than Treasury Shares), to Parent (or, if directed
by Parent, to the Surviving Corporation), in each case by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the Paying Agent,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent (as applicable) for such purpose (it being
understood that only the amount allocable to the applicable Special Litigation
(as provided in the definition of the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount) that
has been so dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved or terminated shall be
released in connection with any such resolution thereof). The Paying Agent
will distribute to each Stockholder (other than any holder of Excluded Shares
at such time) its applicable Pro Rata Percentage of such remaining balance as
Additional Per Share Merger Consideration. The Surviving Corporation shall
pay, through its next regularly scheduled payroll after receipt of funds, to
each holder of the Vested Company Stock Options its applicable Pro Rata
Percentage of such remaining balance as Additional Per Share Merger
Consideration. If a holder of Excluded Shares subsequently becomes a
Surrendering Stockholder, then Parent shall pay (or shall fund to the Paying
Agent and the Paying Agent shall pay) such Surrendering Stockholder its
applicable Pro Rata Percentage of such remaining balance as Additional Per
Share Merger Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, a Dissenting
Stockholder (unless it, he or she becomes a Surrendering Stockholder) shall
not be entitled to receive any portion of such remaining balance and shall
only have the dissenters rights set forth in _SECTION 2.6_.

 



       
 

 



 

 **SECTION 7.5** **_Sources of Recovery_**.

 



 

(a) Subject in all respects to _SECTION 7.4_ and _SECTION 7.6_, the Parent
Indemnified Parties sole sources of recovery for Losses (other than Uninsured
RandW Losses and Losses related to the Special Litigation) shall be:

 



 

(i) First, from the Indemnity Escrow Fund;

 



 

(ii) Second, from the Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy; and

 



 

(iii) Third, and only with respect to Losses arising from a breach of the
Company Fundamental Representations or the Company Tax Representations,
directly from the Sellers, only after (A) the Indemnity Escrow Fund has been
exhausted and (B) either (1) the Representations and Warranties Insurance
Policy has been exhausted, or (2) the insurer providing coverage under the
Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy has indicated to Parent in
writing that the claim (which is not a claim that is wholly excluded on the
face of such policy) Parent submitted for coverage will not be paid, but only
after reasonable pursuit by Parent of such claim under the Representations and
Warranties Insurance Policy.

 



 

(b) Subject in all respects to _SECTION 7.4_ and _SECTION 7.6_, the Parent
Indemnified Parties sole sources of recovery for Uninsured RandW Losses shall
be from the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

 



 

(c) Subject in all respects to _SECTION 7.4_ and _SECTION 7.6_, the Parent
Indemnified Parties sole sources of recovery for the Special Litigation shall
be:

 



 

(i) First, from the Special Indemnity Escrow Fund; and

 



 

(ii) Second, directly from the Sellers, only after the Special Indemnity
Escrow Fund has been exhausted.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
liability of each Seller to indemnify Parent Indemnified Parties for Losses
shall be several, not joint and several, based upon its respective Pro Rata
Percentage, and no Seller shall be liable for any Losses in excess of its Pro
Rata Percentage.

 



 

(e) Subject to _SECTION 8.4(c)_ and _SECTION 8.13_, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that, absent fraud, their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all claims for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this _ARTICLE VII_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party
hereby waives any and all rights, claims and causes of action for any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth
herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it may
have against the other Parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of their
respective representatives arising under or based upon any Law, except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _ARTICLE VII_,
or claim based on or arising from fraud.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the
Parent or Parent Affiliates seeking recovery pursuant to _SECTION 7.5(a)_
with respect to the breach of a Company Tax Representation, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall first cause the Company to utilize
any _Closing Date NOLs_ against any Loss that may be attributable to such
breach. Only such remaining Loss attributable to the breach of a Company Tax
Representation (after the utilization of such Closing Date NOLs) shall be
subject to further recovery pursuant to _SECTION 7.5(a)_.

 



 

 **SECTION 7.6** **_Indemnification Procedures._**

 



 

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a Party or an Affiliate of a Party or a Representative of the foregoing
against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement (a " _Third-Party
Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of such Third-Party Claim. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations or liability hereunder,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been
actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. Such notice by
the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and
shall indicate the good faith estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of, any Third-
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by the Indemnifying
Partys own counsel, but only for so long as it conducts such defense with
reasonable diligence, and the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate in
good faith in such defense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
any such claim or legal proceeding as contemplated in this _SECTION 7.6(a)_,
the Indemnifying Party shall select counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) to conduct the defense of such claim or legal proceeding and
shall have the right to take any action it reasonably deems necessary to
avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims with respect to any
Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, it shall advise the Indemnified Party of the status of such Third-Party
Claim and the defense thereof on a reasonably current basis and consider in
good faith the recommendations made by the Indemnified Parties with respect
thereto, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and
expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel
selected by the Indemnified Party, subject to the Indemnifying Partys right
to control the defense thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable costs and
expenses of such defense (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
of the Indemnified Party if (x) the Indemnified Partys outside counsel shall
have reasonably concluded and advised that there are defenses available to
such Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party, or (y) the Indemnified Partys outside
counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party that there is a conflict of
interest under applicable standards of professional conduct that would require
separate representation for the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party.
If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third-Party
Claim or fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its
election to defend as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may at
the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses), subject to _SECTION 7.6(b)_, pay, compromise
or defend such Third-Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all
Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third-Party Claim. The
Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) and Parent shall cooperate
with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of
any Third-Party Claim, including making available records relating to such
Third-Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of
actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending Party, management employees of
the non-defending Party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of
the defense of such Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
Claims related to Taxes from a Taxing authority shall be addressed in the
manner set forth in _SECTION 4.18(c)_ and not this _SECTION 7.6(a)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Settlement of Third-Party Claims_. The Indemnifying Party shall not enter
into settlement of any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), except as provided in this _SECTION 7.6(b)_. If a
firm offer is made to settle a Third-Party claim, which offer (i) provides
only for the payment of monetary damages that are fully paid by the
Indemnifying Party, (ii) would not result in (A) the imposition of a judgment
or consent decree, in each case, that subjects the Indemnified Party to any
criminal liability or (B) requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the
part of the Indemnified Party or in poses any continuing obligation on the
Indemnified Party, and (iii) provides in customary form, for the full release
of the Indemnified Party from any continuing obligations in connection with
such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree
to such offer, then the Indemnified Party shall also accept and agree to such
offer. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to _SECTION
7.6(a)_, it shall not agree to any settlement or other determination without
the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations or
liability hereunder, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim
in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the good faith estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of
such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. During such 30-day
period, the Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its
Representatives to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise
to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in
respect of the Direct Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assist the
Indemnifying Partys investigation by giving such information and assistance
(including access to the premises and personnel of the Company, if applicable,
and the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the
Indemnifying Party or any of its Representatives may reasonably request. If
the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such 30-day period (or if in
its response it disputes such Direct Claim), the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party
on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 7.7** **_Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_**. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the
Parties as adjustments to the purchase price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL**

 



 

 **SECTION 8.1** **_Amendment_**. This Agreement may only be amended by
written agreement executed by Parent and the Sellers Representative (on behalf
of the Sellers).

 



 

 **SECTION 8.2** **_Waiver_**. The failure of any Party to assert any rights
or remedies shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.

 



 

 **SECTION 8.3** **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original instrument,
and all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same agreement
having the same effect as if the signatures thereto were upon the same
instrument, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered (by telecopy, electronic delivery
or otherwise) to the other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted
by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format"
(".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the
original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same
effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signature.

 



 

 **SECTION 8.4** **_Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Specific
Performance_**.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION.
The Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or to
the extent such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware, and any appellate court
from any thereof (the " _Chosen Courts_ ") solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the
documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as
a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or
that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable
in the Chosen Courts or that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or
that the venue thereof may not be appropriate, or that this Agreement or any
such document may not be enforced in or by such Chosen Courts, and the Parties
irrevocably and unconditionally agree that all claims relating to such action,
suit or proceeding shall be heard and determined in the Chosen Courts. The
Parties hereby consent to and grant any such Chosen Court jurisdiction over
the person of such Parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the
subject matter of such dispute. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, each of the parties hereto hereby consents to the service of process in
accordance with _SECTION 8.5_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by
Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.4_.

 



 

(c) Subject to the remainder of this _SECTION 8.4(c)_, the Parties agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform
their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Each of the Parties
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (x) the other Parties
have an adequate remedy at Law or (y) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _SECTION 8.4(c)_ shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such order or injunction. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon
a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a
Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise at any time of any
other remedy.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 8.5** **_Notices_**. Any notice, request, instruction or other
document to be given hereunder by any Party to the others shall be in writing

4.9_ ( _Directors  and Officers Insurance_), _SECTION 8.12_ ( _Sellers

 **SECTION 8.10** **_Interpretation; Construction_**.

 



 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit, affect the meaning or interpretation or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section,
Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Annex or Exhibit
to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." All pronouns and all variations
thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine or neuter,
singular or plural, as the identity of the Person may require. Where a
reference in this Agreement is made to any agreement (including this
Agreement), contract, statute or regulation, such references are to, except as
context may otherwise require, the agreement, contract, statute or regulation
as amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced from time to time (in
the case of an agreement or contract, to the extent permitted by the terms
thereof); and to any section of any statute or regulation including any
successor to the section and, in the case of any statute, any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder. All references to "dollars" or "$" in this
Agreement are to United States dollars. All references to "days" shall be to
calendar days unless otherwise indicated as a "Business Day." When calculating
the period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to
be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the
reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day
of such period is a non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the
next succeeding Business Day.

 



 

(b) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **SECTION 8.11** **_Assignment_**. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No Party to this Agreement may assign
any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by
operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other
Parties and any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void;
provided, that Parent or Merger Sub may assign their rights or delegate any of
their duties under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent, upon notice to
the Company and Sellers Representative, but without the prior written consent
of the other Parties (provided that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or
Merger Sub of any of its respective obligations hereunder).

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 8.12** **_Sellers Representative_**.

 



 

(a) By the approval of this Agreement pursuant to applicable Law, each Seller
hereby irrevocably appoints the Sellers Representative as the representative,
agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for all of the Sellers for all purposes
under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, including the full
power and authority to act on such Persons behalf: (i) to consummate the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents; (ii) to negotiate disputes arising under, or relating to, this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents; (iii) to give and receive all
notices, communications and funds to be given or received under this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents and to receive service of process in
connection with any claims under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, including service of process in connection with arbitration; (iv)
to withhold any amounts received on behalf of the Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or otherwise to satisfy any and
all obligations or liabilities incurred by the Sellers or the Sellers
Representative in the performance of their duties hereunder or under the other
Transaction Documents; (v) to execute and deliver any amendment or waiver to
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (without the prior approval
of the Sellers); (vi) to bring or defend any claim or action on behalf of the
Sellers to enforce their rights under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents; (vii) to retain the Sellers Representative Expense Amount until it
is liquidated in accordance with _SECTION 8.12(g)_, and to use the funds
constituting the Sellers Representative Expense Amount to satisfy the expenses
of the Sellers Representative in performing its duties hereunder and under the
other Transaction Documents and to satisfy expenses and obligations of the
Sellers hereunder and thereunder; and (viii) to make all other decisions and
determinations and to take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of,
or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of, the Sellers in
connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. The
Sellers further agree that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest,
are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Sellers Representative
and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or
liquidation of any Seller. All decisions and actions by the Sellers
Representative shall be binding upon all of the Sellers, and no Seller shall
have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The
Sellers Representative shall have no duties or obligations hereunder or under
the other Transaction Documents, including any fiduciary duties, except those
expressly set forth herein or therein, and such duties and obligations shall
be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents.

 



 

(b) By the approval of this Agreement pursuant to applicable Law, each Seller
hereby severally, for itself only and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers Representative from and against all Losses incurred
by the Sellers Representative in connection with any action, suit or
proceeding to which the Sellers Representative is made a party by reason of
the fact that it is or was acting as the Sellers Representative.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) The Sellers Representative shall not incur any liability to any Seller by
virtue of the failure or refusal of the Sellers Representative for any reason
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the other Transaction
Documents or relating to the performance of their duties hereunder or
thereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting intentional
misconduct or fraud. The Sellers Representative shall have no liability in
respect of any action, claim or proceeding brought against it by any Seller,
regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be
sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at Law
or in equity, or otherwise, if the Sellers Representative made any decision or
determination or took or omitted taking any action in good faith. The Sellers
Representative shall not be liable to any Seller for any apportionment or
distribution of payments made by the Sellers Representative in good faith.

 



 

(d) The Company hereby agrees that Parent, the Paying Agent and the Escrow
Agent shall be able to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions of
the Sellers Representative as to the settlement of any claims against the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Special Indemnity Escrow Amount, or the
Adjustment Escrow Amount pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
or as to any actions required or permitted to be taken by the Sellers
Representative hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(e) In the event that the Sellers Representative becomes unable or unwilling
to continue in his or its capacity as Sellers Representative, or if the
Sellers Representative resigns as the Sellers Representative, a majority-in-
interest of the Sellers (in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages) may,
by written consent, appoint a new representative as the Sellers
Representative. Upon written acceptance by such successor Sellers
Representative to serve as a Sellers Representative, such successor Sellers
Representative shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all of the
powers and duties and obligations of the applicable original Sellers
Representative without further act, and such original Sellers Representative
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the
other Transaction Documents but shall continue to have the benefits of the
indemnification set forth in this _SECTION 8.12_. Notice and a copy of the
written consent appointing such new Sellers Representative and bearing the
signatures of a majority-in-interest of the Sellers (in accordance with their
Pro Rata Percentages) must be delivered to Parent.

 



 

(f) All out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal, accounting and other
advisors fees and expenses, if applicable) reasonably incurred by the Sellers
Representative in performing any actions under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents will be paid out of the Sellers Representative Expense
Account from time to time, as and when such fees and expenses are incurred.

 



 

(g) The Sellers Representative Expense Amount shall be held by the Sellers
Representative in the Sellers Representative Expense Account for the benefit
of the Sellers for reimbursements payable to the Sellers Representative under
this _SECTION 8.12(g)_, or, as provided below, the payment of fees,
commissions or other compensation to the Sellers Representative. After the
latest of (x) any and all amounts payable from under _SECTION 2.5_ have been
paid or released, (y) the payment of the Contingent Consideration (if any) or
final determination that no such payment is required under _SECTION 2.7_, and
(z) the dismissal, settlement, issuance of non-appealable orders or judgments
or other termination or resolution of each Special Litigation, including the
full payment of all amount owed in respect of any judgment, settlement or
otherwise to any Parent Indemnified Party and the full reimbursement of the
Litigation Expenses to the Parent Indemnified Parties, the Sellers
Representative shall promptly pay to each Seller its Pro Rata Percentage of
the then-remaining amount of the Sellers Representative Expense Amount as
Additional Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _SECTION 8.12(h)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) To the extent that the Sellers Representative receives Additional Per
Share Merger Consideration on behalf of the Sellers (including any remaining
amount of the Sellers Representative Expense Amount pursuant to _SECTION
8.12(g)_), the Sellers Representative shall be responsible for making or
causing the distribution of such Additional Per Share Merger Consideration to
each Seller (including, as appropriate, through the Surviving Corporations
payroll). As there are several components of the Additional Per Share Merger
Consideration, for the sake of efficiency and convenience, the Sellers
Representative shall be entitled to hold any such amounts, for a period not to
exceed sixty 60 days, prior to making distributions of then-aggregated amounts
of the Additional Per Share Merger Consideration. All of Parents and the
Surviving Corporations and their respective Affiliates obligations to make
any payment of any Additional Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Agreement shall be fully discharged when such payment is made to the Sellers
Representative and none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates shall have any responsibility or liability for any
payments due hereunder once such payments are made to the Sellers
Representative. No interest shall be paid on any portion of the Additional Per
Share Merger Consideration.

 



 

(i) Parent shall be entitled to rely on any action taken by the Sellers
Representative and in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation have any liability whatsoever to the extent arising out of or
resulting from actions or inactions of the Sellers Representative. For the
avoidance of doubt, the failure of any Seller to execute and deliver a Letter
of Transmittal shall in no way affect the rights or scope of the Sellers
Representative or the Parents ability to rely on the determinations made, and
actions taken, by the Sellers Representative.

 



 

 **SECTION 8.13** **_No Waiver or Limitation Relating to Claims for Fraud_**.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of
the provisions set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver or other
limitation by any Party of any right or remedy which such Party may have at
Law or in equity against a Person based on any fraud.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 8.14** **_Debt Financing Sources_**. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, each Seller Related Party and each
other Party hereto: (a) agrees that it will not bring or support any Person,
or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support any Person, in any action,
suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of
any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources or any other Person
that has committed or subsequently commits to provide or otherwise enters into
agreements in connection with providing the Debt Financing to Parent or any of
its Affiliates, and each of its or their respective former, current and future
Affiliates, equityholders, members, partners, controlling persons, officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives involved in such
Debt Financing (collectively, the " _Lender Parties_ ") in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New York State courts located
in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York; (b) submits for
itself and its property with respect to any such action to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts described in clause (a); (c) agrees that service
of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at
its address provided in _SECTION 8.5_ (Notices) shall be effective service of
process against it for any such action brought in any such court described in
clause (a); (d) waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such action in any such court described in clause (a); (e)
agrees that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law; (f) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitments, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Lender Parties
in any way relating to the Debt Financing Commitments or the performance
thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New
York, without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the
extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of
laws of another jurisdiction; and (g) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH SELLER RELATED
PARTY AND EACH OTHER PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT,
IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY
WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE
PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE FINANCINGS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY OR ANY OTHER
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (x) the Lender Parties
are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to the
protections of this _SECTION 8.14_ to the same extent as if the Debt
Financing Sources were parties to this Agreement; (y) this _SECTION 8.14_
(and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,
supplement, waiver or other modification of such provision would modify the
substance of this Section) may not be amended, supplemented, waived or
otherwise modified in any manner that is materially adverse to the Debt
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing
Sources; and (z) no Seller Related Party (other than the Parent and the Merger
Sub) shall have any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source in
connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and no Debt Financing Source shall have any
rights or claims against any Seller Related Party (other than Parent and
Merger Sub) in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise; provided that the foregoing will not limit the
rights of the parties to the Debt Financing under any commitment letter
related thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 8.15** **_No Recourse_**. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement or any rights of the Company at Law or in equity, in the event
of any default or breach by Parent under this Agreement, the Companys
remedies shall be restricted to enforcement of its rights against the property
and assets of Parent and no resort shall be had to any of the partners,
shareholders, members or other equity holders of Parent or any Affiliate of
any such Persons or to any property and assets of any of the partners,
shareholders, members or other equity holders of the foregoing. This Agreement
may only be enforced against, and any claim or clause of action based upon,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement may only be brought against the
entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect
to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. No
past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, shareholder, affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any
Party shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of any Party
under this Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise)
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby
or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith.

 



 

 **SECTION 8.16** **_Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver_**. Blank
Rome LLP has represented the Sellers, the Company and its Subsidiary. The
Parties agree that (a) the Parent shall not, and shall not cause the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiary to, seek to have Blank Rome LLP disqualified
from representing the Sellers in connection with any dispute that may arise
between the Sellers and the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereunder, and (b) in connection with any dispute that may arise between the
Sellers and the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiary, the
Sellers (and not the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiary) in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder will
have the right whether or not to waive the attorney-client privilege that may
apply to any communications between the Company and its Subsidiary on the one
hand and Blank Rome LLP on the other hand that occurred prior to the Closing.
Parent, for itself, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiary, and for its
and such respective Persons Affiliates, successors and assigns, irrevocably
acknowledges and agrees that all communications between any of the Sellers,
the Company and its Subsidiary, and Blank Rome LLP made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and Closing under, or any
dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with this Agreement or
transactions contemplated hereunder that, immediately prior to the Closing,
would be deemed to be privileged communications of any of the Sellers, the
Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiary and Blank Rome LLP and would not be
subject to disclosure to Parent in connection with any process relating to a
dispute arising under or in connection with, this Agreement or transactions
contemplated hereunder, shall continue after the Closing and for all purposes
be deemed to be privileged communications between the Sellers and Blank Rome
LLP and neither Parent nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or
through Parent shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds
that the privilege attaching to such communications, belongs to the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiary, and not the Sellers.
