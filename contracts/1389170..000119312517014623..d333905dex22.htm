_Preliminary Settlement Statement_ "), which shall include a calculation and
good faith estimate of the Adjustment Amount prepared in accordance with the
principles set forth on _Exhibit A_ (such estimated amount, the " _Estimated
Adjustment Amount_ "), together with a reasonably detailed explanation and
supporting detail of the calculation thereof. If Buyer disputes any amounts or
adjustments set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer and
Seller will reasonably negotiate in good faith to resolve any such dispute by
the Closing Date. If the Parties cannot resolve the dispute by the Closing
Date, then the Estimated Adjustment Amount initially proposed by Seller, or
such other amount as the Parties may mutually agree, will be used for purposes
of calculating the Closing Amount. Pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ , the
Estimated Adjustment Amount is included in the calculation of the Closing
Amount. 

(b) Not later than the 90th day following the Closing Date, Buyer will
prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth the calculation of the final Adjustment Amount (the " _Final
Adjustment Amount_ "), together with a reasonably detailed explanation and
supporting detail of the calculation thereof. Buyer will provide to Seller
such additional data and information as Seller may reasonably request to
verify the amounts reflected on the Post-Closing Statement. Not later than the
30th day following receipt of the Post-Closing Statement hereunder, Seller
may deliver to Buyer a written notice (an " _Adjustment Notice_ ") containing
any changes Seller proposes to be made in the Post-Closing Statement. If
Seller does not deliver to Buyer an Adjustment Notice within such 30 day
period, then Seller will be deemed to have irrevocably accepted and agreed to
all items in the Post-Closing Statement. If

 



19  Seller does timely deliver to Buyer an Adjustment Notice, then Seller will
be deemed to have accepted and agreed to all items in the Post-Closing
Statement, other than such matters that are specifically disputed with
reasonable supporting explanation in such Adjustment Notice. The Parties will
negotiate in good faith to agree on the Final Adjustment Amount no later than
30 days after delivery of any Adjustment Notice in accordance with the
foregoing.

(c) If an Adjustment Notice is timely delivered to Buyer in accordance with
_Section 2.3(b)_  and the Final Adjustment Amount is mutually agreed upon in
writing by Seller and Buyer during such 30 day period, then the Final
Adjustment Amount as so agreed will be considered conclusive and binding on
the Parties.

 

(d) If an Adjustment Notice is timely delivered to Buyer in accordance with
_Section 2.3(b)_ and the Final Adjustment Amount is not mutually agreed upon
by Seller and Buyer during such 30 day period, then KPMG LLP (the "
_Accountant_ ") will be engaged by the Parties to resolve any disagreements.
If such accounting firm does not agree to serve as the Accountant within 10
days after written request from the Parties to serve, then the Parties will
mutually select and engage an alternative internationally recognized
accounting firm, or if the Parties are unable to agree upon such firm or such
firm declines to serve as the Accountant, then either Party may request that
the American Arbitration Association select the Accountant, and the Parties
will engage such Accountant. In connection with the engagement of the
Accountant, each Party will execute such engagement, indemnity and other
agreements as the Accountant and the American Arbitration Association may
reasonably require as a condition to such engagement. The Accountant will
determine as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 30 days after
the selection of the Accountant, based solely on (A) a written submission
provided by each of Buyer and Seller to the Accountant within 10 days
following the Accountants selection (and without independent investigation
on the part of the Accountant) and (B) the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, whether the Post-Closing Statement requires adjustment. In
resolving such dispute, the Accountant will act as an expert and not an
arbitrator and will resolve such dispute by selecting either the position
submitted by Seller or the position submitted by Buyer, in either case, to the
Accountant pursuant to this _Section 2.3(d)_. The Accountant may not award
damages or penalties. Each Party will bear its own legal fees and other costs
of presenting its case to the Accountant. The fees and expenses of the
Accountant and the American Arbitration Association incurred in resolving such
disputed matters shall be paid by the Party whose position is not selected by
the Accountant in accordance with this _Section 2.3(d)_. The determination of
the Accountant with respect to such dispute will be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties. The date on which the Final Adjustment Amount is
finally determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ is referred to as
the " _Determination Date_."

 

(e) Any difference between (i) the Estimated Adjustment Amount used to
calculate the Closing Amount and (ii) the Final Adjustment Amount as
determined on the Determination Date will be paid by the owing Party to the
owed Party within 5 Business Days of the Determination Date by way of wire
transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_.
For example, if the Final Adjustment Amount is _greater_ than the Estimated
Adjustment Amount, then Buyer (as the owing Party) will pay to Seller the
difference in Dollars between the Final Adjustment Amount and the Estimated
Adjustment Amount, and if the Final Adjustment Amount is _less_ than the
Estimated Adjustment Amount, then Seller (as the owing Party) will pay to
Buyer the difference in Dollars between the Estimated Adjustment Amount 

 



20  and the Final Adjustment Amount. Buyer, at its option, on written notice to
Seller, shall be permitted to set off any amounts Seller is required to pay to
Buyer pursuant to this _Section 2.3(e)_ against the Subsequent Payment.

(f) All payments made, or to be made, under this Agreement by one Party to
the other Party will be made by electronic transfer of immediately available
funds to the receiving Partys account set forth on _Schedule 2.3(f)_ , or to
such other bank and account as may be specified by the receiving Party in
writing to the paying Party.

(iv) From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall hold in confidence and
not disclose to any Person, the Earn-Out Confidential Information; _provided,
however,_ Seller may disclose the Earn-Out Confidential Information or
portions thereof to its Representatives who need to know such information for
the purpose of reviewing, determining, and if necessary, resolving any dispute

purpose. Seller shall inform all of its Representatives of the terms of this
Agreement, shall obtain the agreement of its Representatives to be bound by

_Section_ __ _ 2.4_ by it or its Representatives. If Seller or its
Representatives are requested or compelled to disclose any Earn-
Out Confidential Information by judicial or administrative process, by any
Governmental Authority or by other requirements of Law, Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such Earn-Out
Confidential Information that Seller is advised by its counsel that it is
legally required to disclose; provided that Seller shall cooperate with Buyer,
at Buyers expense, to permit Buyer to obtain an appropriate protective order
or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded

Affiliates or their Representatives to Seller, its Affiliates and their
Representatives, after Closing, arising out of or relating to the Earn-Out
Contracts or this _Section_ __ _ 2.4 _, in whatever form (whether oral,

Affiliates in breach of this Agreement, (B) has come into the possession of
Seller or its Affiliates from a third party (which for purposes of clarity, is

22 (c) _Delivery of Earn-Out Statements_. Subject to the Earn-Out Contract
Non-Disclosure Restrictions, prior to or contemporaneously with the payment of

OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount, but no more than once with respect to each

be made within 30 days after the delivery of the applicable Earn-Out

and agreed to the 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount or 2018 OSDO Earn-Out
Payment Amount, as applicable; _provided_ , if a Force Majeure Event occurs
during the 2018 Earn-Out Period and the Force Majeure Earn-Out Amount has not
been paid to Seller on or prior to the date on which the Earn-Out Statement
for the 2018 Earn-Out Period is delivered to Seller, then Sellers right to
request an audit pursuant to this Section 2.4(d) shall be extended until
30 days after the Force Majeure Earn-Out Amount is paid to Seller. For the
avoidance of doubt, if Seller does not exercise its right to audit either the
2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount or the 2018 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount
within the time periods set forth in the foregoing sentences of this _Section
2.4(d)_ , the 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount or the 2018 OSDO Earn-Out
Payment Amount (as applicable) shall be final and conclusive for all purposes,
except, with respect to the 2018 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount, to the extent
the 2018 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount is otherwise subject to increase in
respect of any Unreached OMO Cap amount. If Seller delivers an Earn-Out Audit
Notice within the time periods set forth in the foregoing sentences of this
_Section 2.4(d)_ , then Buyer will cause the Company to hire KPMG (or if KPMG
is conflicted or otherwise unwilling to serve, another auditor mutually
agreed by Buyer and Seller) (the " _Earn-Out Auditor_") to audit the
calculation of any payments made with respect to such Earn-Out Period
pursuant to an engagement letter containing such terms and conditions
(including as to the scope of such audit) as may be reasonably requested to
enable the Earn-Out Auditor to audit the calculation of such payments, as
mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller; _provided,_ (i) the scope of such audit
shall be limited to a review by the Earn-Out Auditor of (A) the calculation of
the 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount or 2018 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount
(as applicable), (B) the Earn-Out Contracts, (C) this Agreement and (D) the
information required to be provided to the Earn-Out Auditor pursuant to
_Section 2.4(e)(v)_ upon which the 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount or 2018
OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount (as applicable) is based and (ii) the Earn-Out
Auditor must agree to comply with the Earn-Out Contract Non-Disclosure
Restrictions. Within 3 Business Days of Buyers receipt of the final results
of such audit, Buyer shall provide a copy of such final results to Seller,
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the results of such audit shall be
provided in a format and aggregated, as necessary, to ensure compliance by
Buyer and the Earn-Out Auditor with any Earn-Out Contract Non-Disclosure
Restrictions. The final results of the Earn-Out Auditor will be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties. If it is determined as a result of or
in connection with such audit that the actual

 



23  amount of such payments should have been greater than the amounts previously
paid by Buyer with respect to such Earn-Out Period, then Buyer will
promptly, but in any event within 5 Business Days, pay such difference to
Seller, and in the event that it is determined as a result of or in connection
with such audit that the actual amount of such payments should have been less
than the amounts previously paid by Buyer with respect to such Earn-Out
Period, then Seller will promptly, but in any event within 5 Business Days,
reimburse Buyer for such difference; _provided, however,_ Buyer, at its
option, shall also be permitted to set off such amounts pursuant to _Section
2.4(h)_ or obtain payment from the Escrow Account. Seller agrees that it shall
reimburse Buyer for 50% of the fees and expenses of the Earn-Out Auditor.

(e) _Covenants of Buyer_. Commencing on the Closing Date and through the
end of the Earn-Out Period, Buyer covenants as follows:

 

(i) Buyer will, and will cause the Company and Buyers other Affiliates to,
operate the Company Business in the ordinary course of business consistent
with Buyers past practice (and, for the avoidance of doubt, without regard to
the impact of any such operations in the ordinary course of business
consistent with Buyers past practice on the 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment
Amount or the 2018 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount);

 

(ii) Buyer will not, and will cause the Company and Buyers other
Affiliates not to, intentionally take or fail to take any action for the
purpose of reducing the 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount or the 2018 OSDO
Earn-Out Payment Amount;

 

(iii) Buyer will, and will cause the Company and Buyers other Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to timely connect wells so that the
Company is not in default under any of the Earn-Out Contracts;

 

(iv) Buyer will not, and will cause the Company and Buyers other
Affiliates not to, intentionally amend any Earn-Out Contract for the purpose
of reducing the 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount or the 2018 OSDO Earn-Out
Payment Amount;

(v) Buyer will, and will cause the Company and Buyers other Affiliates to,
provide the Earn-Out Auditor (A) the Earn-Out Contracts upon which the
calculation of the 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount or 2018 OSDO Earn-Out
Payment Amount (as applicable) is based, (B) the producer settlement
statements upon which the calculation of the 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount
or 2018 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount (as applicable) is based, (C) the
information set forth in Section 2.4(b)(i)(A)-(J), (D) any information used by
Buyer in respect of the calculations set forth in  _Section 2.4(f)_ (Force
Majeure Adjustment), _Section 2.4(h)_ (Right of Setoff) and _Section 2.4(i)_
(Acceleration) of this Agreement, and (E) any other information upon which the
calculation of the 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount or 2018 OSDO Earn-Out
Payment Amount (as applicable) is based and which the Earn-Out Auditor
reasonably requests.

 



24 (vi) From Closing until the date on which any audit related to the 2018
OSDO Earn-Out Payment is completed, Buyer will, and will cause the Company and
Buyers other Affiliates to, maintain adequate records of the Company and the
Company Assets and maintain copies of the documents relating to the
information set forth in _Section 2.4(e)(v)_ , in each case so that the Earn-
Out Auditor can audit Buyers calculation of the 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment
Amount or the 2018 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount, as applicable, in accordance
with _Section 2.4(d)_ ;

 

(vii) Buyer will, and will cause the Company and Buyers other Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with Buyers past
practice, to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to perform the Companys
obligations pursuant to the Earn-Out Contracts;

 

(viii) Buyer will, and will cause the Company and Buyers other Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate off-spec gas,
including nitrogen, CO2 and/or H2S, consistent with Buyers past practice and
in accordance with the specifications and terms set forth in the applicable
Earn-Out Contracts, and, notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer will, and will
cause the Company and Buyers other Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with Buyers past practice to seek alternative solutions
with customers under the Earn-Out Contracts to accommodate such off-spec gas,
provided that such alternative arrangements are not, as determined by Buyer
in its reasonable discretion, uneconomic to Buyer (disregarding, for the
purposes of such determination, Buyers obligation to pay the 2017 OSDO Earn-
Out Payment Amount and the 2018 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount), and, for the
avoidance of doubt, any such additional payments, fee increases or other
economic incentives accruing to Buyer, the Company or any of Buyers other
Affiliates, as applicable, as a result of the implementation of such
arrangements to accommodate off-spec gas, including nitrogen, CO2 and/or H2S,
under any Treating Fee Amendments shall be for the sole benefit of Buyer, the
Company or such other Affiliate of Buyer, as applicable, and shall not be
included in Gross Margin or otherwise considered in determining the 2017 OSDO
Earn-Out Payment Amount or the 2018 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount;

(ix) subject to the Earn-Out Contract Non-Disclosure Restrictions, Buyer
will provide Seller with notice of any amendments to any Earn-Out Contracts
that impact the applicable Contract Fees or that might otherwise impact the
calculation of the 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount or the 2018 OSDO Earn-Out
Payment Amount, promptly upon adoption thereof, together with a copy of each
such amendment; and

(x) if the Company enters into any Contract described on _Schedule 1.1(f)_
after the Closing Date, but prior to February 28, 2017, then within 5 Business
Days following the entry by the Company into such Contract, Buyer shall
provide written notice to Seller as to whether such Contract shall constitute
an Identified In-Process Contract in accordance with the definition of such
term.

 

(f) _Force Majeure Adjustment_. If, during the 2018 Earn-Out Period,
there occurs one or more Force Majeure Events pursuant to any Earn-Out
Contract, in each case,

 



25  lasting 10 days or more (each such period of a Force Majeure Event, a "
_Force Majeure Period_ " and each day during the Force Majeure Period, a "
_Force Majeure Day_ "), then for purposes of calculating the 2018 OSDO Earn-
Out Payment Amount, the Gross Margin with respect to the 2018 Earn-Out Period,
shall be increased by an amount equal to the product of the number of Force
Majeure Days in such Force Majeure Period and the Force Majeure Daily Gross
Margin (the " _Force Majeure Earn-Out Amount_"); _provided, however,_ that
the Force Majeure Earn-Out Amount is in lieu of the Gross Margin during the
Force Majeure Period and thus the Replaced Gross Margin Amount shall be
subtracted from the Gross Margin with respect to the 2018 Earn-Out Period.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent that
the Force Majeure Daily Gross Margin has not been determined prior to May 15,
2019, Buyer shall, nonetheless, make a payment to Seller pursuant to _Section
2.4(a)(ii)_ in respect of the 2018 Earn-Out Period based on the actual Gross
Margin during the 2018 Earn-Out Period and shall thereafter, promptly, but in
any event within 5 Business Days, following the determination of the Force
Majeure Daily Gross Margin make an additional payment to Seller in an
amount equal to the Force Majeure Earn-Out Amount, less the Replaced Gross
Margin Amount. For purposes of this Agreement: (a) the " _Replaced Gross
Margin Amount_ " means (i) during any full calendar month comprising a
portion of the Force Majeure Period, the actual Gross Margin during such full
calendar month during a Force Majeure Period, if any and (ii) during a partial
calendar month comprising a portion of the Force Majeure Period, the Partial
Month Replaced Gross Margin for such partial month, (b) the " _Partial Month
Replaced Gross Margin_ " means (i) the Estimated Gross Margin Per Throughput
Unit multiplied by (ii) the Estimated Daily Volume multiplied by (iii) the
number of Force Majeure Days in such partial calendar month, (c) " _Estimated
Gross Margin Per Throughput Unit_ " means (i) the actual Gross Margin during
the full calendar month in which such partial calendar month during the Force
Majeure Period occurs (the " _Estimated Month_ ") divided by (ii) the
Delivered Volumes in the Estimated Month and (d) the " _Estimated Daily
Volume_ " means the Delivered Volumes during the Estimated Month divided by
the number of days in the Estimated Month.

(g) _Amendments to Earn-Out Contracts_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if any
Earn-Out Contract is amended at any time after the Closing Date, the original
terms (including as to fees, the permitted time for making well connections,
the requirements for determining which wells the Company is obligated to
connect, etc.) as set forth in such Earn-Out Contract as of the Closing Date
will be the contract terms used for calculating the Gross Margin with respect
to each Earn-Out Period, provided that, subject to the Earn-Out Contract Non-
Disclosure Restrictions, Buyer shall provide prompt written notice to Seller
following the adoption of any amendment (effective during the Earn-Out Period)
to any Earn-Out Contract in connection with the dedication of any additional
acreage or release of any acreage by any customer that is party to any such
Earn-Out Contract and, if the Contract Fees in such Earn-Out Contract are
amended pursuant to or in connection with such amendment, then Seller shall
have the option to elect (such election to be made within 30 days of Seller
receiving Buyers notice of such amendment and the information requested by
Seller pursuant to the next sentence) for the Gross Margin with respect to
such Earn-Out Contract and with respect to the period following the adoption
of such amendment to be calculated based on either (A) the terms of such Earn-
Out Contract as amended, including at such revised Contract Fees but also

 



26  including Delivered Volumes from any wells on such additional acreage
(whether such additional acreage is dedicated pursuant to such amended Earn-
Out Contact or a new Contract, with any such new Contract thereafter being
deemed to be an Earn-Out Contract for all purposes), or (B) the terms of such
Earn-Out Contract as in effect as of the Closing Date (which will not include
the additional acreage), and such new Contract will not be a new Earn-Out
Contract. Subject to the Earn-Out Contract Non-Disclosure Restrictions, Buyer
will provide Seller with all information available and reasonably requested by
Seller in order to enable Seller to determine which terms it will elect to
apply from and after the date of the adoption of any such amendment.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if, at any
time following the Closing but prior to the end of the Earn-Out Period, any
acreage that is dedicated to the Company Assets pursuant to any Earn-Out
Contract is released and new acreage is dedicated in a related transaction
(such an occurrence, an " _Acreage Swap_ "), whether pursuant to an existing
Earn-Out Contract or pursuant to a new Contract with the applicable customer,
then, from and after the later of the effective date of such Acreage Swap or
the execution date of such Earn-Out Contract amendment or new Contract (the "
_Swap Date_ "), such new acreage shall be treated as the original acreage
under the applicable Earn-Out Contract for purposes of determining the
Delivered Volumes and calculating the Gross Margin with respect to such Earn-
Out Contract, and such new treatment will only occur from and after the Swap
Date with respect to the Gross Margin calculation.

 

(iii) If an Earn-Out Contract is amended in a manner adverse to the
Company, as determined by Buyer in its reasonable discretion, after the
Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, without the consent of Buyer as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.1_, such Earn-Out Contract shall cease to be an
Earn-Out Contract effective as of the Closing Date.

 

(h) _Right of Setoff_. Buyer shall have the right to set off against the
2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount, the 2018 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount, the
Change of Control Amount, and any Sold Earn-Out Contract Payments, as
applicable, otherwise payable by Buyer to Seller under this _Section_ __ _
2.4,_ (i) any amounts that are due and payable to Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement, including pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, _Section 2.4(d)_ and
_Article 9_ and (ii) the reasonable estimated amount, as determined by Buyer,
of any good faith Claims for indemnification arising pursuant to _Article 9_
of this Agreement and which have been presented to Seller in accordance with
_Article 9_ thereof and remain unresolved or unpaid by Seller (" _Unresolved
Claims_ "). If Buyer intends to make such a set off, Buyer shall give written
notice to Seller of its intent to make such a set off, on or prior to the
date the applicable 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount, the 2018 OSDO Earn-Out
Payment Amount, the Change of Control Amount, or Sold Earn-Out Contract
Payment is due. If it is subsequently and finally determined that a portion of
the amount set off for an Unresolved Claim was not owed to Buyer pursuant to 
_Article 9_ , Buyer shall within 5 Business Days pay such amount to Seller
plus interest at a rate of 10% per annum, which shall accrue daily from the
date that the 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount, 2018 OSDO Earn-Out Payment
Amount, Change of Control Amount, or Sold Earn-Out Contract Payment, as
applicable, from which such amount was set off was due; _provided_ , any
interest paid pursuant to the previous clause shall not be deemed to
constitute any part of the

 



27  2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount, the 2018 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount,
the Change of Control Amount, or any Sold Earn-Out Contract Payment, as
applicable, and shall not be considered for purposes of determining whether
the Total Earn-Out Cap has been attained.

 

(i) _Acceleration_.

 

(i) Following a Buyer Change of Control Transaction, the provisions of
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ shall remain in full force and effect and shall
become the obligations of the acquiror or successor to Buyer in such Buyer
Change of Control Transaction, and in the case of a Buyer Change of Control
Transaction described in clauses (a) and (b) of the definition of Buyer
Change of Control Transaction, Buyer shall cause such acquiror or successor to
agree that such acquiror or successor shall thereafter be obligated to comply
with the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ in lieu of Buyer and that
Seller shall be a third party beneficiary of such agreement. Contemporaneously
with the consummation of such Buyer Change of Control Transaction, Buyer will
pay to Seller or will cause to be paid to Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in accordance with the wire instructions set forth
on _Schedule 2.3(f)_ (or such other instructions as may be delivered by Seller
to Buyer prior to any such payment), the applicable Change of Control Amount.

(ii) If prior to March 1, 2019, Buyer enters into any transaction pursuant
to which Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company after the Closing)
cease to serve as the service provider under any Earn-Out Contract due to a
direct or indirect sale or assignment of such Earn-Out Contract (whether by
sale, assignment, merger, consolidation or other transaction) (a " _Sold Earn-
Out Contract_"), then no later than 30 days following the consummation of
such direct or indirect sale or assignment, Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the wire
instructions set forth on _Schedule 2.3(f)_ (or such other instructions as
may be delivered by Seller to Buyer prior to any such payment), an amount
equal to the product of (x) 0.175 multiplied by (y) the applicable Contract
Percentage multiplied by (z) the Remaining Cap (any such payment, a " _Sold
Earn-Out Contract Payment_"), where (A) the " _Remaining Cap_ " is
$715,000,000, _minus_ the amount of any amounts paid by or on behalf of Buyer
pursuant to (i) _ Section_ __ _ 2.4_ of this Agreement (or due by Buyer to
Seller, but set off pursuant to _Section 2.4(h_ )) and (ii) _ Section_ __ _
2.4_ of the ODO MIPSA (or due by Buyer to ODO, but set off pursuant to
_Section 2.4(h_ ) of the ODO MIPSA) as of such date, (B) the " _Contract
Percentage_ " is the percentage calculated by dividing the Assigned Contract
Gross Margin by the Total Gross Margin, (C) the " _Assigned Contract Gross
Margin_ " is the Gross Margin for the Sold Earn-Out Contract during the Look
Back Period, (D) " _Total Gross Margin_ " is the Gross Margin for all of the
Earn-Out Contracts during the Look Back Period and (E) the " _Look Back
Period_ " is the trailing 3 months period from the date of the consummation of
such direct or indirect sale or assignment of the applicable Sold Earn-Out
Contract. Following the payment by Buyer of any Sold Earn-Out Contract Payment
with respect to any Sold Earn-Out Contract, no further payments will be made
by Buyer with respect to such Sold Earn-Out Contract and from and after the
date of such direct or indirect sale or assignment, such Sold Earn-Out
Contract shall cease to be an Earn-Out Contract for purposes of this
Agreement.

 



28 (j) _Total Cap_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, in no event shall (i) payments made by Buyer pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_, Section 2.4 of the OMO MIPSA and Section 2.4 of the ODO
MIPSA or (ii) or due by Buyer pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, Section
2.4 of the OMO MIPSA and Section 2.4 of the ODO MIPSA, but set off pursuant to
_Section 2.4(h)_ of this Agreement, Section 2.4(h) of the OMO MIPSA or Section
2.4(h) of the ODO MIPSA, respectively, exceed, in the aggregate, the Total
Earn-Out Cap.

 

(k) _Unreached OMO Cap_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, Seller shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, in
its sole discretion, to impose a cap on the amount of the Unreached OMO Cap by
providing written notice to Buyer. Any such notice delivered by Seller to
Buyer pursuant to this _Section 2.4(k)_ shall be irrevocable; _provided_ ,
that Seller may issue a subsequent notice pursuant to this _Section 2.4(k)_
providing for a further reduction of such cap.

 

(l) _Operation of Company Business; No Guarantee_. The Parties understand
and agree that: (i) subject to the covenants of Buyer under this _Section_ __
_ 2.4_ and this Agreement, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall have the
complete right, power and authority to operate and control the Company,
including the Company Business and the Company Assets, in any manner as it
shall determine in its sole and absolute __ discretion, (ii) payment of the
2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount and the 2018 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount
pursuant to this Agreement is only a contractual right to receive a contingent
cash payment and does not represent any actual equity or other ownership in
Buyer, the Company, the Company Business or any of the Company Assets; (iii)
attainment of the 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount and the 2018 OSDO Earn-Out
Payment Amount is speculative and subject to numerous factors outside the
control of Buyer and the Company; and (iv) there is no assurance that Seller
will earn any 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount or 2018 OSDO Earn-Out Payment
Amount and Buyer has not guaranteed that any 2017 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount
or 2018 OSDO Earn-Out Payment Amount will be attained.

Section 2.5. _Purchase Price Allocation_. Promptly after the Closing Date,
Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain Opportune LLP (the " _Allocation Firm_
") to prepare the allocation of the Purchase Price, the liabilities of the
Company and any other amounts treated as consideration for U.S. federal income
tax purposes among the Company Assets for Tax purposes in a manner consistent
with the principles of Sections 1060 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury
Regulations thereunder (" _Purchase Price Allocation_ "). In connection
therewith, Buyer and Seller shall enter into an engagement letter with the
Allocation Firm, the terms of which shall be mutually agreed upon by Buyer and
Seller. The cost of the Allocation Firm shall be paid by Buyer. Buyer and
Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the Allocation Firm

the Closing Date. The Allocation Firm shall prepare the Purchase Price
Allocation in reasonable consultation with Seller and Buyer prior to delivery
of the Purchase Price Allocation. Seller and Buyer agree to (a) amend the
Purchase Price Allocation to take into account any subsequent adjustments to
the Purchase Price, in the manner consistent with the principles of Sections
1060 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations thereunder and (b) report
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement consistently with the Purchase
Price Allocation, as adjusted by the Parties, on all applicable Tax Returns,
including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, Asset Acquisition Statement,
and will not assert, and will cause their Affiliates not to assert, in
connection with any Tax Proceeding or

 



29  other proceeding with respect to Taxes, any asset values or other items
inconsistent with the amounts set forth on the Purchase Price Allocation,
unless with the agreement of the other Party or otherwise required by
applicable Law or a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1)
of the Code. The Parties shall promptly advise each other regarding the
existence of any Tax Proceeding related to the Purchase Price Allocation.

this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the Parties shall use

Transaction Documents.

(b) Buyer will pay the statutory filing fee associated with filings under

and Seller shall or shall cause their respective counsel to supply to the
other Party copies of all correspondence, filings or written communications by
such Party or its Affiliates with any Governmental Authority or staff members
thereof, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents, except for documents filed pursuant to Item
4(c) and Item 4(d) of the HSR Notification and Report Form (which shall be
provided in the event any Governmental Authority issues a request
for additional information and documentary material under the HSR Act) or
communications regarding the same, documents or information submitted in
response to any request for additional information or documents pursuant to
the HSR Act that reveal any Partys negotiating objectives, strategies or
purchase price expectations or a Partys communications containing information
covered by the attorney client or work product privilege, unless the Parties

prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the Parties will (i) give each
other reasonable advance notice of all meetings and communications with any

independently in any such meeting or communication without first giving the

and participate in such meeting or communication, (iii) give the other Party
reasonable advance notice of all oral communications with any Governmental
Authority relating to Antitrust Laws, (iv) if any Governmental Authority

other Party of the substance of such communication, and (v) provide each
other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with all written
communications (including any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either
Party relating to proceedings under the Antitrust Laws) with a Governmental
Authority regarding the Antitrust Laws; _provided, however_ , that each Party
will be solely responsible for the final content of any substantive oral or
written communications of that Party with any applicable antitrust
Governmental Authority. Buyer and Seller shall jointly determine all tactics
and strategies relating to their compliance with this  _Section_ __ _ 5.2_
and obtaining the termination or expiration of any applicable HSR Act waiting
period, subject to each Party undertaking good faith consultations and taking
the view of the other Party into account.

 

Section 5.3. _Information, Access and Assistance_.

 



48 (a) Upon receipt of reasonable advance notice, Seller will afford
Buyer and its authorized Representatives reasonable access from the Execution
Date through the earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article 8_ and the Closing Date, during normal business hours, solely in
furtherance of Buyers investigation of the Company and the Company Assets,
to the Companys offices, properties, books and records, and officers, and
will furnish Buyer with such additional information concerning the Company
Business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence prior to Closing, (i) Buyer will not be
entitled to conduct intrusive environmental sampling or testing, without the
prior written consent of Seller, Buyer being limited to visual inspections
and certain assessments of the properties and facilities of the Company and
the review of all records and any other publicly available materials or
information with regard to these matters; (ii) Buyer will have no right of
access to, and the Company will have no obligation to provide to Buyer, (A)
information relating to bids received from others in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and information and analysis
(including financial analysis) relating to such bids, (B) any information the
disclosure of which would constitute a waiver of a legal privilege available
to the Company, (C) any information the disclosure of which would cause the
Company or its Affiliates to breach a written confidentiality agreement
executed by the Company and an unaffiliated third party, or (D) any
information the disclosure of which would result in a violation of Law; and
(iii) without the prior written consent of Seller, Buyer will not contact any
suppliers to, or customers of, the Company with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. All information obtained pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.3_ will be " _Evaluation Material_ " as such term is used in the
Confidentiality Agreement and will be subject to the terms thereof.

 

(b) Any inspection or investigation conducted by Buyer or its
Representatives prior to the Closing will be conducted in accordance with
applicable Laws, including any applicable Environmental Laws, and in such
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company. Seller (and its Affiliates) makes no representation or warranty as
to the accuracy of any information (if any) provided pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_, and Buyer may not rely on the accuracy of any such
information, in each case other than as expressly set forth in Sellers
representations and warranties contained in _Article 3_ (subject to the
limitations in _Section_ __ _ 3.24_) and the Transaction Documents.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
provisions of this  _Section 5.3(b)_ will survive the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article 8_ and the Closing.

 

(c) If Buyer exercises rights of access under this _Section 5.3(c)_ or
otherwise, or conducts examinations or inspections under this _Section
5.3(c)_ or otherwise, then (i) such access, examination and inspection will be
at Buyers sole risk, cost and expense and Buyer waives and releases all
Claims against Seller, the Company and its partners and members and their
Affiliates and the respective employees, directors, officers, attorneys,
contractors and agents of such parties (collectively the " _Inspection_
_Indemnitees_ ") arising in any way therefrom or in any way related thereto
and (ii) except to the extent of an Inspection Indemnitees gross negligence
or willful misconduct, Buyer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Inspection Indemnitees from and against any and all such Claims, Liabilities
or Losses of any kind or character arising out of this _Section 5.3(c)_ ;
provided, however, Buyer shall not have indemnity obligations or
responsibility for matters merely discovered as part of any such access,
examination or inspection. THE FOREGOING RELEASE AND INDEMNIFICATION

 



49  WILL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH CLAIMS, LIABILITIES OR LOSSES ARISE OUT OF
(A) NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
KNOWING AND INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT) OF SELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES OR (B) STRICT
LIABILITY.

 

Section 5.4. _Public Announcements_. Seller agrees that, except to the
extent necessary to comply with the requirements of (a) applicable Laws, (b)
any listing agreements with, or rules and regulations of, securities exchanges
or (c) the rules, regulations or Orders of any other Governmental Authority,
neither it nor its Affiliates shall make or cause to be made, a press release
or similar public announcement or communication concerning the existence or
subject matter of this Agreement unless approved in advance by Buyer, which
approval cannot be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_
, that with respect to any press release or similar public announcement or
communication for which advance approval is not required in accordance with
the foregoing, to the extent practicable, reasonable notice and a copy of
such release, announcement or communication will be provided to Buyer prior to
issuing the same, and Seller will reasonably cooperate with Buyer with respect
to the timing, manner, and content of such release, announcement or
communication. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Buyer shall be permitted to issue press releases or
similar public announcements or communications concerning the existence or
subject matter of this Agreement without the consent or approval of Seller;
_provided, however,_ Buyer shall provide Seller with reasonable notice and a
copy of such release, announcement or communication prior to issuing the same
and Buyer will reasonably cooperate with Seller with respect to the timing,
manner, and content of such release, announcement or communication.

 

Section 5.5. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of Buyer and Seller will use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and to ensure the satisfaction of its conditions to Closing set
forth herein.

 

Section 5.6. _Transfer Taxes_. The transactions contemplated by this
Agreement involve the transfer of the Membership Interests, which are
intangible assets; accordingly, the Parties do not expect any state and local
transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar Taxes to arise by
reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(" _Transfer Taxes_ "). To the extent that any Transfer Taxes are assessed,
such Transfer Taxes will be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller. The Parties
will cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law, the amount of any Transfer Taxes.

Section 5.7. _Tax_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns with
respect to the Company required to be filed after the Closing Date for any
Pre-Closing Period on a basis consistent with past practice, except to the
extent otherwise required by applicable Law. Reasonably in advance of filing
any such Tax Return (which in the case of a Tax Return that relates to Income
Taxes, shall not be later than 30 days prior to such filing), Seller shall
deliver a

 



50  copy of such Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation and work
papers, to Buyer for its review and reasonable comment. Buyer will cause such
Tax Return (as revised to incorporate Buyers reasonable comments) to be
timely filed and will provide a copy to Seller.

(b) Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns with
respect to the Company required to be filed after the Closing Date for any
Straddle Period on a basis consistent with past practice, except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law. Reasonably in advance of filing any
such Tax Return (which in the case of a Tax Return that relates to Income
Taxes, shall not be later than 30 days prior to such filing), Buyer shall
deliver a copy of such Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation
and workpapers, to Seller for its review and reasonable comment. Buyer will
cause such Tax Return (as revised to incorporate Sellers reasonable comments)
to be timely filed and will provide a copy to Seller.

 

(c) For purposes of determining Seller Taxes with respect to any Straddle
Period of the Company, the portion of any Tax for such Straddle Period that
is attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date shall be:

 

(i) with respect to Taxes that are (A) Income Taxes, (B) imposed in
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible) or (C) imposed on specific transactions,
including payroll taxes, deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if
the Tax year of the Company ended on the Closing Date; _provided_ , that all
exemptions, allowances, or deductions for the Straddle Period which are
calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated in proportion to the number of
days in such period prior to and including the Closing Date; and

 

(ii) with respect to Property Taxes that are ad valorem, real property,
personal property or other Property Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, deemed
to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period, multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

(d) All tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any commercial agreements or contracts entered into in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and not primarily
related to Taxes) with respect to or involving the Company shall be terminated
as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company shall not be
bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 

Section 5.8. _Cooperation on Tax Returns and Tax Proceedings_. The Parties
will cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation
or other proceeding (each a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to Taxes
imposed on or with respect to the assets, operations or activities of the
Company. Such cooperation will include the retention and (upon the other
Partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Notwithstanding the above, the
control and conduct of any Tax Proceeding that involves an Asserted
Liability will be governed by _Section_ __ _ 9.5_.

 



51 Section 5.9. _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any payments
made to any Party pursuant to _Article 9_ shall constitute an adjustment of
the Closing Amount for Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by the
Parties on their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by Law.

 

Section 5.10. _Restrictive Covenants_.

 

(a) Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) Buyer would not have
entered into this Agreement if Seller had not agreed to the covenants set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_, that _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ is a material
term and material incentive for entering into this Agreement, and (ii) Seller
has had access to and is selling to Buyer as part of this Agreement the
goodwill of the Company and information that is confidential and proprietary
to the Company, that constitutes a valuable, special and unique asset of the
Company, and with respect to which Buyer is entitled to the protections
afforded by this Agreement and to the remedies for enforcement of this
Agreement provided by law or in equity (including those remedies the
availability of which may be within the discretion of the court or
arbitrator that presides over any action for which enforcement of this
Agreement is brought).

(b) For a period of 18 months after the Closing Date, Seller agrees that
it will not (i) directly or indirectly employ or engage any (A) Business
Employee who accepts an Employment Offer from Buyer or any other Field
Business Employee who receives an Employment Offer from Buyer, (B) Company
Service Provider who provides services to the Company after the Closing or (C)
employee of Buyer or any of its Affiliates with whom Seller or any of its
Affiliates had contact with or became aware of prior to the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Restricted Employees_ "), or (ii) directly or indirectly
solicit the employment or services of, or cause or attempt to cause to leave
the employment or service of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer, any Restricted
Employees; _provided, however_ , that Seller may solicit or hire any
Restricted Employees (X) Buyer has consented to the solicitation or hiring of
such individual in writing, which consent Buyer may withhold in its sole
discretion or (Y) with respect to Restricted Employees who are not Business
Employees or Company Service Providers, such solicitation solely occurs by
general solicitation for employment not directed at any such
Restricted Employees.

(c) For a period of 18 months following the Closing Date, Seller agrees
that it will not, directly or indirectly, acting alone or as a member of a
partnership or company, as a holder or owner of any security, as a lender,
agent, advisor, consultant or independent contractor:

 

(i) within the Restricted Area, carry on, participate in, or be engaged in
(whether for its own account or for the account of any other Person) the
Restricted Business;

(ii) share in the earnings of, or beneficially own or hold any security
issued by, or otherwise own or hold any interest in any entity which is
engaged in the Restricted Business within the Restricted Area; or

 



52 (iii) encourage or induce, directly or indirectly, any customer or
supplier of the Company who is a customer or supplier of the Company within
the Restricted Area immediately prior to the Closing, or is a prospective
customer or supplier of the Company within the Restricted Area immediately
prior to the Closing, to curtail, cancel or materially reduce its business or
refrain from doing business with, Buyer or its Affiliates (which after Closing
includes the Company) within the Restricted Area.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.10(c)_ , Seller
may own, solely as an investment, securities of an entity that is engaged in
the Restricted Business within the Restricted Area if (1) Seller is not an
Affiliate of the issuer of such securities, (2) Seller does not, directly or
indirectly, beneficially own more than 5% in the aggregate of such class of
securities, and (3) Seller has no active participation in such entity.

(d) From the Closing Date and for a period of 2 years thereafter (or with
respect to any contract with a term longer than two years, for a period
equivalent to the term of such contract) (such period, the "Confidentiality
Period"), Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold in confidence
and not use, any Confidential Information; _provided, however_ , that Seller
and its Affiliates shall be able to use or disclose any such Confidential
Information (i) as may be reasonably required by Seller or its Affiliates in
connection with any insurance proceedings or Tax audits against or proceedings
concerning Seller or its Affiliates or (ii) to enforce its rights and comply
with its obligations under this Agreement. If Seller or any of its Affiliates
is requested or compelled during the Confidentiality Period to disclose any
Confidential Information by judicial or administrative process, by any
Governmental Authority or by other requirements of Law, Seller or such
Affiliate (as applicable) shall be permitted to make such disclosure;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller or such Affiliate (as applicable), to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, promptly notifies Buyer in writing and
discloses only that portion of such Confidential Information that Seller or
such Affiliate (as applicable) is legally required to disclose and that Seller
or such Affiliate (as applicable) provides reasonable cooperation to Buyer, at
Buyers expense, with respect to any actions taken by Buyer to obtain an
appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded Confidential Information. Further, notwithstanding
any other provision in this Agreement, Seller may disclose Confidential
Information to Sellers Affiliates and each of their respective partners,
members, officers, managers, directors, agents and investors to the extent
Seller deems reasonably necessary in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the confidentiality and non-use
restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.10(d)_ and Seller shall be
responsible for a breach by Sellers Affiliates and each of their respective
partners, members, officers, managers, directors, agents and investors of this
_Section 5.10(d)_ to the extent Seller provides Confidential Information to
such Affiliates or other persons.

 

(e) Seller hereby agrees that if Seller violates or threatens to violate
any of the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_, it would be difficult
to determine the entire cost, damage or injury which Buyer and its Affiliates
would sustain. Seller acknowledges that if it violates any of the provisions
of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_, Buyer may have no adequate remedy at law. In
the event of such violation, Buyer shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights that may be available to it, to seek to obtain in any court
of competent jurisdiction injunctive relief to restrain any violation by
Seller of any provision of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ or to seek to compel
specific performance by Seller of one or more of its obligations under this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.10_. The seeking or

 



53  obtaining by Buyer of such injunctive relief shall not foreclose or in any
way limit the right of Buyer to obtain a money judgment against Seller for any
damage to Buyer that may result from any breach by Seller of any provision of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_.

(f) Seller acknowledges that the covenants contained in _Section_ __ _
5.10_ are reasonable in geographic and temporal scope and that the scope of
each of the activities being restrained is reasonable and does not impose a
greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other business
interest of Buyer and the Company. If any court of competent jurisdiction
determines that any of such covenants, provisions or portions of _Section_ __
_ 5.10_, or any part thereof, are unenforceable or otherwise invalid, then
(i) the validity and enforceability of any remaining covenants, provisions or
portions thereof shall not be affected by such determination, (ii) those of
such covenants, provisions or portions that are determined to be
unenforceable because of the duration or scope thereof shall be reformed if
possible by the court to reduce their duration or scope so as to render the
same enforceable against Seller to the maximum duration and broadest
scope permitted by law, and if such reformation is not possible, then
severance by the court, and (iii) all remaining covenants, provisions,
portions and terms of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall be valid and
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Section 5.11. _Update of Schedules_. From time to time prior to
the Closing Date and in accordance with the last sentence of this _Section_
__ _ 5.11_, Seller shall supplement or amend the Schedules with respect to
any event, development, occurrence or non-occurrence of an event hereafter
arising and of which Seller has Knowledge (each a " _Schedule Supplement_ ")
if such event, development, occurrence or non-occurrence of an event has
caused, or would reasonably be expected to cause, any representation or
warranty made by it to be untrue or inaccurate. For all purposes, including
for purposes of _Article 9_ and for purposes of determining whether the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Article 6_ have been fulfilled, the
Schedules shall be deemed to include only that information contained in the
Schedules on the Execution Date and shall be deemed to exclude the Schedule
Supplement; _provided, however_ , that if such event, development, occurrence
or non-occurrence of any event which is the subject of the Schedule Supplement
gives Buyer the right to terminate this Agreement on account of a breach of
Sellers representations, warranties and covenants under this Agreement
relating to the Schedule Supplement, but Buyer does not terminate this
Agreement and Closing occurs, then Buyer shall not be entitled to make any
indemnity Claim with respect to the matter or matters on the Schedule
Supplement that gave Buyer the right to terminate this Agreement. Seller
agrees to provide any such Schedule Supplement to Buyer (i) no later than 5
Business Days prior to the Closing Date with respect to any event,
development, occurrence or non-occurrence of an event that arises prior to the
5th Business Day prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) promptly (but in any
event within 1 Business Day) following any event, development, occurrence or
non-occurrence of an event that arises after the fifth Business Day prior to
the Closing Date and before 1 Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

Section 5.12. _Loss Events_.

 

(a) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing, all or any
portion of the Company Assets are destroyed or damaged by fire, flood,
earthquake, storm, theft, vandalism, explosion, blowout, riot, sabotage,
accident or other casualty of a similar nature and the aggregate amount of the
reasonably estimated Restoration Cost in respect thereof exceeds 

 



54  $100,000 (a " _Casualty Loss_ ") or is taken in condemnation or under right
of eminent domain and the aggregate amount of the reasonably estimated
Restoration Cost in respect thereof exceeds $100,000 (a " _Takings Loss_ "
and together with a Casualty Loss, a " _Loss Event_ "), Seller will promptly
send notice to Buyer of the occurrence of such event (a " _Loss Event Notice_
") and provide Buyer with all reasonably requested information with respect
thereto, including allowing Buyer and its Representatives to visit and survey
the damage resulting therefrom. If either Party believes in good faith that
the amount of the aggregate Restoration Cost for such Loss Events is equal to
or exceeds $700,000, the Parties will together promptly select an independent
third-party appraiser with relevant expertise in assets of the type that
suffered the Loss Event (an " _Appraisal Firm_ ") who will be engaged to
determine the amount of Restoration Cost for such Loss Event. If the Parties
are unable to agree upon an Appraisal Firm by the expiration of 15 days
following the delivery of the Loss Event Notice, each of Seller, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, will select a separate Appraisal Firm to
determine the Restoration Cost. If the two Appraisal Firms so selected do not
agree on the Restoration Cost, then the two Appraisal Firms will select
a third Appraisal Firm to determine the Restoration Cost. The final
Restoration Cost will be the average of the two Restoration Cost estimates
that are the closest in amount relative to each other. Each Party will use its
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause any Appraisal Firm engaged by such
party in accordance with this _Section 5.12(a)_ to return its determination of
the Restoration Cost within 30 days after the date of such appraisers
engagement by such Party;  _provided_ that neither Party may delay the
Closing for the time periods set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_ for
the determination of the Restoration Cost unless such Party, upon delivery of
a Loss Event Notice, believes in good faith that the amount of the aggregate
Restoration Cost for such Casualty Loss is equal to or exceeds $1,750,000;
_provided further,_ that if Closing occurs prior to determination of the
Restoration Cost by the Appraisal Firm(s), the Restoration Cost used at
Closing shall be Buyers good faith estimate of the Restoration Cost (the "
_Estimated Restoration Cost_ ") and after the determination of the Restoration
Cost by the Appraisal Firm(s) (the " _Appraised Restoration Cost_ ") is made,
if the Estimated Restoration Cost is less than the Appraised Restoration Cost,
then Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer the amount of such difference and if
the Appraised Restoration Cost is less than the Estimated Restoration Cost,
Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller the amount of such difference.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.12(c)_ and _Section 5.12(d)_ , in the event of
any such Loss Event, at the Closing, the Company and Seller will promptly pay
to Buyer all sums paid to Seller or its Affiliates by any insurance company or
other Person for the Restoration Cost of the Loss Event.

 

(c) In the event of a Loss Event after the Execution Date but prior to the
Closing involving an aggregate Restoration Cost that is greater than $700,000
but less than $6,475,000, Seller and Buyer will proceed with the Closing but
the Base Consideration will be adjusted downward by the estimated Restoration
Cost (as determined pursuant to _Section 5.12(a))_ for such Loss Event;
_provided_ that, in such case, to the extent that the Base Consideration is so
reduced, all insurance proceeds (other than for business interruption, if any)
or condemnation awards received by Seller, the Company or their respective
Affiliates, with respect to such Loss Event, whether before or after the
Closing, will be retained by or promptly paid to Seller upon receipt,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.12(b)_.

 



55 (d) If after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing, there is a
Loss Event and the aggregate Restoration Cost is greater than $6,475,000 as
established in accordance with _Section 5.12(a)_ , either Seller or Buyer may
elect to terminate this Agreement by giving 5 days prior written notice to
the other Party; _provided_ , that Seller shall not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 5.12(d)_ if Buyer agrees to
proceed with the Closing and in such case the Base Consideration will be
reduced by only $6,475,000 notwithstanding the fact that the Restoration Cost
in respect of such Loss Event is greater than $6,475,000 (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, Seller shall have no responsibility under this Agreement
or otherwise for such excess amount), and in such a case insurance proceeds
shall be paid as set forth in the immediately following sentence. If neither
Party exercises such right to terminate or if Buyer agrees to proceed with the
Closing in accordance with the proviso to the foregoing sentence, then Seller
and Buyer will proceed with the Closing but the Base Consideration will be
adjusted downward by (i) the estimated Restoration Cost for such Loss Event
(as determined pursuant to _Section 5.12(a))_ or (ii) if Buyer agrees to
proceed with the Closing in accordance with the proviso to the foregoing
sentence, $6,475,000 (as applicable); _provided_ that, in such case, to the
extent the Base Consideration is so reduced, all insurance proceeds (other
than proceeds from business interruption insurance, if any) or condemnation
awards received by Seller, the Company or their respective Affiliates, with
respect to such Loss Event, whether before or after the Closing, will be
retained by or promptly paid to Seller upon receipt, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in _Section 5.12(b)_ , up to the amount of the Restoration
Cost, _provided_ that, if Buyer agrees to proceed with the Closing in
accordance with the proviso to the foregoing sentence, Buyer shall be
entitled to any such insurance proceeds and condemnation awards received by
Seller, the Company or their respective Affiliates in excess of $6,475,000 in
an amount equal to the Restoration Cost minus $6,475,000;
_provided, however,_ all insurance proceeds, if any, from business
interruption or other similar insurance received by Seller, the Company or
their respective Affiliates, with respect to such Loss Event, whether before
or after the Closing, shall be promptly paid to Buyer.

(e) The occurrence of a Loss Event after the Execution Date but prior to
the Closing will not, in and of itself, be deemed a breach of Sellers
representations and warranties, covenants or other obligations under this
Agreement absent some other breach of Sellers representations and warranties,
covenants or other obligations under this Agreement. An election by either
Party to exercise its right pursuant to _Section 5.12(d)_ to terminate this
Agreement will not, in and of itself, result in any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of such Party under this Agreement.

(f) In the event of any Loss Event, Seller and Buyer agree, as applicable,
to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts and, if applicable, to cause the
Company to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, to pursue claims and collect
any amounts to which the Company may be entitled under the applicable
insurance policies or condemnation awards in respect of such Loss Event.

Section 5.13. _No Solicitation of Other Bids_. Seller will not, and will
not authorize or permit any of its Affiliates or any of its or their
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate,
facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter
into discussions or negotiations with any Person concerning a possible
Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements or other instruments
to effect an Acquisition

 



56  Proposal. Seller will immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and will
cause its Affiliates and all of its and their Representatives to immediately
cease and cause to be terminated, all existing discussions or negotiations
with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could lead to,
an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " will
mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Buyer or any
of its Affiliates) concerning (i) a merger, consolidation, liquidation,
recapitalization, membership interest exchange or other business combination
transaction involving the Company; (ii) the issuance or acquisition of
membership interests or other equity securities in the Company; or (iii) the
sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of any significant portion of the
Companys properties or assets.

 

Section 5.14. _Transferred Employees_.

 

(a) Contemporaneously with the execution hereof, Seller is delivering to
Buyer _Schedule 5.14(a)_ , which will not be attached to this Agreement, and
which lists all of the Field Business Employees. _Schedule 5.14(a)_ sets forth
(i) each such Field Business Employees job title, date of hire and (ii) each
such persons current annualized base salary or base hourly wage, date of
last salary increase and a summary of material bonuses and other compensation,
including all vacation or sick time or other paid time off which is accrued
but unused, if any, payable to such Field Business Employee by Seller or its
Affiliates, including any payments or benefits which may be conditioned upon
or due upon Closing or termination of the Business Employees relationship
with the Company or its Affiliates. Seller and its Affiliates shall, upon
reasonable prior written notice from Buyer and for the sole purpose of
enabling Buyer to determine which Field Business Employees to make Employment
Offers (as defined below) to, permit the Buyer a reasonable opportunity to
interview each of the Business Employees prior to the Closing Date and shall
provide to Buyer reasonable access to the personnel files regarding such
Business Employees (other than Business Employees designated as "corporate"
employees on  _Schedule 3.11(b)(i))_ , subject to appropriate limitations as
required by applicable Law.

(b) Buyer or any of its Affiliates may, but is not required to, make
offers to one or more Business Employees for employment with Buyer or its
Affiliates (the " _Employment Offers_ "). Any such Employment Offers shall be
made not less than five days prior to the Closing Date. Employment Offers
will include an offer of benefits similar to the benefits provided to
comparable employees of Buyer. Each Employment Offer will comply with the
requirements of applicable Law and will specify that, if the Employment Offer
is accepted by the Business Employee, such Business Employees employment with
Buyer or its Affiliate (as applicable) will commence as of the Closing Date;
_provided, however_ , that each such Employment Offer shall be contingent on
the occurrence of the Closing and on the Business Employee meeting Buyers
standard employment conditions for comparable actively working
employees/contractors, including background checks and drug testing and
authorization to work in the United States. Promptly following Sellers
receipt of written notice from Buyer regarding any Employment Offers made by
Buyer, and in any event, prior to Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, terminate the employment or other relationship with each Field
Business Employee and to whom Buyer elects to make an Employment Offer (and
who has not otherwise resigned), which termination shall be conditional on the
occurrence of the Closing and effective as of the Closing Date. On the
Closing Date, Seller shall pay or cause to be paid, to each Field Business
Employee who accepts employment with Buyer, (i) all earned wages or salaries
that

 



57  relate to periods on or prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) all unused
vacation time, sick time and other time-off benefits that each such
unused vacation time, sick time and other time-off benefits has accrued, but
not used, as of the Closing Date (" _PTO Amounts_ "). With respect to any
Field Business Employees who accept employment with Buyer, Buyer shall
promptly reimburse the Seller for the PTO Amounts and which are either set
forth on _Schedule 5.14(a)_ or have been accrued in the ordinary course of
business of the Company since the Execution Date.

 

(c) Seller and its Affiliates (which shall not include the Company after
Closing) shall be solely responsible for all Liabilities with respect to, and
the payment of all, compensation, benefits and all other similar obligations
whatsoever, relating to any current or former employee (including, but not
limited to, the Business Employees), officer or director of Seller or its
Affiliates, or any person engaged by Seller or its Affiliates in his or her
individual capacity as an independent contractor or in his or her individual
capacity as a consultant of Seller or its Affiliates who, in each case,
provided services to the Company, including hourly pay, commission, bonus,
salary, fringe, pension or profit sharing benefits, vacation or sick time or
other paid time off, change of control payments or severance pay, which, in
each case, arose during or is relating to any service with Seller and its
Affiliates at any time at or prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Pre-Closing Employment Liabilities_"). Buyer and its Affiliates
(which includes the Company after Closing) shall be solely responsible for
all Liabilities, and the payment of all compensation and all other obligations
whatsoever, relating to any Business Employees who accept Employment Offers,
including hourly pay, commission, bonus, salary, accrued vacation, fringe,
pension or profit sharing benefits, vacation or sick time or other paid time
off, or severance pay, which, in each case, arise during or is relating to any
service with Buyer or its Affiliates (which, following the Closing, includes
the Company) at any time at or following the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Post-Closing Employment Liabilities_ "). On the Closing Date or within six
days thereafter (or such earlier date as may be required under applicable
Law), Seller shall pay or cause to be paid, to each Business Employee who
accepts an Employment Offer all earned but unpaid wages or salaries that
relate to their employment by the Seller or any of its Affiliates for the
final pay period in which the Closing Date occurs.

Section 5.15. _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Within 20 Business Days after Closing, Seller shall deliver (at
Sellers sole expense) to a location of Buyers choice all of the Companys
books, records, documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence, writings,
evidences of title and other papers and electronic files relating to the
Company Business and Company Assets (the " _Records_ ") of the Company that
are in the possession of Sellers and its Affiliates and not the Company.
Additionally, within 20 Business Days after Closing Seller shall deliver to
the Buyer files containing physical copies of all title insurance policies,
title opinions, title abstracts, deeds covering the Owned Real Property, and
surveys in possession of Seller or its Affiliates or their Representatives
relating to the Real Property, and physical copies of all Real Property Leases
and Easements.

 

(b) After the Closing Date, Buyer will grant to Seller (or its
Representatives), access at all reasonable times to all Records relating to
the period prior to Closing in possession of the Company or Buyer and its
Affiliates, and will afford such Party the right to take extracts therefrom
and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to prepare
such Partys

 



58  financial statements and tax reports, implement the provisions of this
Agreement, or to investigate or defend any Claims among the Parties and/or
their Affiliates arising under this Agreement. Buyer will maintain such
Records until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date (or for such longer
period of time as Seller may reasonably determine is necessary in order to
have the Records available with respect to Tax matters), or if any of the
Records pertain to any Claim or dispute pending on the seventh anniversary of
the Closing Date, Buyer will maintain any of the Records designated by Seller
or its Representatives until such Claim or dispute is finally resolved and the
time for all appeals has been exhausted.

Section 5.16. _Insurance Matters_.

 

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing Date (i)
Seller or its Affiliates may terminate coverage with respect to the
properties and assets of the Company under any insurance policies maintained
by the Company or with respect to which the Company is a named insured or
otherwise the beneficiary of coverage (the " _Seller Insurance Policies_ ");
(ii) none of the properties or assets of the Company will be covered under
Seller Insurance Policies following the Closing Date; and (iii) Buyer shall
become solely responsible for procuring, maintaining and paying for
all insurance policies with respect to post-Closing issuance coverage for the
properties and assets of the Company.

 

(b) Except as otherwise provided by and subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.12_
and _Article 9_ , Seller and its Affiliates shall be entitled to receive and
retain any and all amounts paid to insured Persons pursuant to any Seller
Insurance Policy in respect of any insurance claim relating to the conduct of
the business of the Company prior to the Closing Date.

Section 5.17. _Continuing Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of 180 days from the Closing Date, regardless of any
amendments of the Organizational Documents of the Company, Buyer shall cause
the Company to honor and provide all rights to indemnification and advancement
of expenses existing as of the Closing Date in favor of Seller, in its
capacity as the sole member of the Company, and its Affiliates and
their respective members, shareholders, partners, directors, officers,
managers, employees, representatives, and agents (collectively, the " _Member
Indemnified Persons_ "), as provided in the Organizational Documents of the
Company immediately prior to Closing; provided that, if any Claim or Claims
are asserted or made within such 180 day period, all rights to indemnification
and advancement of expenses in respect of such Claim or Claims shall continue
until the final disposition of any and all such Claims.

(b) The obligations of Buyer and the Company under this  _Section_ __ _
5.17_ shall survive the Closing and shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to affect adversely any Member Indemnified Person to whom
this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_ applies without the consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of such affected Member Indemnified
Person (it being expressly agreed that the Member Indemnified Persons to whom
this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.17_, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.17_).

 



59 (c) In the event Buyer, the Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns, within 180 days of the Closing Date (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person in
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the
Company, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_. The agreements and covenants contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.17_ shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights
to which any Member Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law,
contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it
being understood and agreed that the rights provided for in this _Section_ __
_ 5.17_ are not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any
such policies.

indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and each of
their respective officers, directors, members, managers, partners, employees,
agents and representatives, and their respective successors and assigns, from
and against any claims, liabilities, costs, expenses or losses arising out of
the preparation of or the use by Buyer of the financial statements, or the
cooperation or requests, contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.18_ with

") then such De Minimis Losses will not be deemed to be Losses under this
Agreement and will not be eligible for indemnification under this _Article 9_.
For purposes of clarity, if any individual Claim or series of related Claims
(if such Claim or series of related Claims arise out of the same or similar
facts or circumstances) for indemnification by Buyer that is made as a Claim
for a Warranty Breach that is subject to indemnification under _Section_ __ _
9.2_ results in Losses that equal or exceed $100,000, then no portion of such
Losses shall be considered a De Minimis Loss.

(b) Except for a Warranty Breach with respect to Fundamental Representations
and Warranties and Fraud Claims, the Buyer Indemnified Parties will be
entitled to be indemnified pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ for Losses
incurred for any Warranty Breach (excluding any De Minimis Loss) only if and
to the extent that the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $875,000.

(c) Except for a Warranty Breach with respect to Fundamental Representation
and Warranties and Fraud Claims, Sellers liability to the Buyer Indemnified
Parties under _Section 9.2(a)_ will be limited, in the aggregate, (i) to the
Escrow Amount plus (ii) 10% of any amounts payable by Buyer to Seller
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4_. Under no circumstance will Sellers
liability for any Losses arising out of or relating to this Agreement
(including in respect of Fraud) exceed the Purchase Price.

 

(d) No indemnifying Person will be liable for any Losses that are subject to
indemnification under _Sections 9.2_ or _9.3_ unless a written demand for
indemnification under this Agreement is delivered by the indemnified Person to
the indemnifying Person with respect thereto prior to 5:00 P.M. Central Time
on the date pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ on which the survival period of
the applicable representations and warranties or covenants expires, to assert
a Claim for indemnification describing such Claim in reasonable detail,
including the factual circumstances giving rise to and the provisions under
this Agreement on which such Claim is based. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any Claim for indemnification under this Agreement that is duly brought prior
to such time will survive until such matter is resolved.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
under no circumstances will any Party or any of its Affiliates be entitled to
recover more than one time for any Loss under this Agreement, and to the
extent a Party or any of its Affiliates is compensated for a matter through
the adjustments provided for in _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, such Party and its
Affiliates will not have a separate right to indemnification for such matter.

Section 9.5. _Claims Procedures_.

 



74 (a) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified Person of notice (i) of the
commencement or assertion of any Claim or Legal Proceeding by a third party
or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, such indemnified Person
believes is likely to give rise to a Claim or Legal Proceeding by a third
party or (ii) of facts causing any indemnified Person to believe it has a
Claim for indemnification hereunder (an " _Asserted Liability_ "), such
indemnified Person will give prompt written notice thereof (the " _Claim
Notice_ ") to the relevant indemnifying Person. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, as long as the Claim Notice is given within the applicable survival
period set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, the failure to so notify the
indemnifying Person will not relieve the indemnifying Person of its
obligations or liability hereunder, except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the indemnifying Person. The Claim Notice will describe
the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and will indicate the amount
(estimated, if necessary) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered. The
indemnified Person and the indemnifying Person agree to keep each other
reasonably appraised of any additional information concerning any Asserted
Liability.

 

(b) As to an Asserted Liability arising from a third party action, the
indemnifying Person will be, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.5_, entitled to assume control of and appoint lead counsel
for such defense only for as long as it conducts such defense with reasonable
diligence. The indemnifying Person will keep the indemnified Persons advised
of the status of such third party action and the defense thereof on a
reasonably current basis and will consider in good faith the recommendations
made by the indemnified Persons with respect thereto. If the indemnifying
Person assumes the control of the defense of any third party action in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_, the indemnified
Person will be entitled to participate in the defense of any such third party
action and to engage, at its expense, separate counsel of its choice for such
purpose, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying Person will
continue to control such defense; _provided_ that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the indemnifying Person will pay the reasonable costs and expenses
of such defense (including reasonable attorneys fees) of the indemnified
Persons if (x) the indemnified Persons outside counsel will have reasonably
concluded and advised in writing (with a copy to the indemnifying Person)
that there are defenses available to such indemnified Person that are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying Person, or
(y) the indemnified Persons outside counsel will have advised in writing
(with a copy to the indemnifying Person) the indemnified Person that there is
a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct to have common counsel for the indemnifying
Person and the indemnified Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the
indemnifying Person will obtain the prior written consent of the indemnified
Person before entering into any settlement, compromise, admission or
acknowledgement of the validity of such Asserted Liability if the settlement
requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the part of the indemnified
Person, subjects the indemnified Person to criminal liability or does not
unconditionally release the indemnified Person from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such Asserted Liability or the settlement imposes
injunctive or other equitable relief against, or any continuing obligation or
payment requirement on, the indemnified Person and (ii) the
indemnified Person will be entitled to participate, at its own cost and
expense, in the defense of such Asserted Liability and to engage separate
counsel of its choice for such purpose.

 

(c) Each Party will cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Asserted
Liability arising from a third party action and will furnish or cause to be
furnished such records,

 



75  information and testimony (subject to any applicable confidentiality
agreement), and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(d) In the case of a Claim not based upon a third party action (" _Direct
Claim_ "), the indemnifying Person shall have forty-five (45) days from its
receipt of the Claim Notice to either (i) admit its obligation to provide
indemnification or (ii) dispute the Claim for indemnification, and provide a
written explanation for its position and supporting documentation. In the
event that the indemnifying Person disputes a Claim Notice for a Direct Claim,
the Parties, including appropriate management representatives, shall promptly
seek to negotiate a resolution in good faith. If the Parties are unable to
resolve the dispute within ninety (90) days after the indemnifying Person
first receives the Claim Notice for a Direct Claim, then the indemnified
Person may seek any remedy available to it under this Agreement. If the
indemnifying Person fails to respond to the Claim Notice relating to a Direct
Claim within such forty-five (45) day period, then the indemnifying Person
shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide indemnity for all reasonable
costs and expenses relating to the Direct Claim referenced in the Claim
Notice.

Section 9.6. _Waiver of Remedies_.

 

(a) Other than for instances of Fraud by a Party and except as otherwise
provided pursuant to the terms of the OMO MIPSA (and the
Transaction Documents as defined in the OMO MIPSA), the OSDO MIPSA (and the
Transaction Documents as defined in the OSDO MIPSA), Escrow Agreement, the

Party will have any liability, and neither Party will (and each Party will

other matter, under, relating to or arising out of this Agreement (including
breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement) or any other
contract or other matter delivered pursuant hereto, or the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other
Laws or otherwise, except for a claim for indemnification pursuant to Article
9 or a claim for set off pursuant to Section 2.4(h), and (ii) this Article 9

Parties and any other Person entitled to indemnification hereunder relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to Section
5.10, Section 5.12, Section 5.17 and Section 10.16.

RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, IN SUCH PERSONS CAPACITY AS SUCH, OR BY SELLER, IN
ITS CAPACITY AS THE SOLE MEMBER OF THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THE CLOSING, PROVIDED
ANY SUCH ACTIONS WERE TAKEN OR OMISSIONS WERE AVOIDED, IN EACH CASE, IN GOOD
FAITH, EXCEPT PURSUANT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS
ARTICLE 9, SECTION 2.3, SECTION 2.4(H) OR SECTION 10.16. SECTION 9.4(A)-(C)
AND SECTION 9.6(A)-(B) SHALL APPLY TO ANY LOSS, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM
THE OTHER PARTYS OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT.

(c) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, EXCEPT IN THE
CASE OF FRAUD BY A PARTY WITH RESPECT TO, AND THEN ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF, A
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE BY SUCH PARTY IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO PARTY NOR
ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE FOR THE FOLLOWING (" _NON-REIMBURSABLE
DAMAGES_"): SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING ANY
DAMAGES ON ACCOUNT OF LOST PROFITS OR OPPORTUNITIES, OR LOST OR DELAYED
BUSINESS BASED ON VALUATION METHODOLOGIES ASCRIBING A DECREASE IN VALUE TO

AND ASSIGNS) SHALL HAVE ANY OBLIGATION HEREUNDER, AND BUYER HAS NO RIGHTS OF

Section 9.7. _Determination of Amount of Damages; Mitigation_.

 

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article 9_ will be limited to the Losses suffered by the indemnified Person
and will be computed net of (a) any insurance or other proceeds actually
received by the indemnified Person in connection with such Losses (less any
increase in premiums associated therewith, deductibles or reasonable
costs incurred in obtaining such recovery) (b) any indemnity, contribution or
other similar payment the indemnified Person actually received from any Person
with respect to such Loss (less reasonable costs incurred in obtaining such
recovery), and (c) any other payment or monetary recoupment actually received
by the indemnified Person as a result of the events giving rise to the Claim.
Any indemnified Person that becomes aware of Losses for which it intends to
seek indemnification hereunder will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts in
the ordinary course of business consistent with its past practice to pursue
Claims and collect any amounts to which it may be entitled under insurance
policies; _provided, however,_ such indemnified Person shall not be required
to take such actions prior to pursuing an indemnity Claim hereunder. If any
third party recovery or insurance recovery is actually received by the
indemnified Person after having previously received indemnity Claim proceeds
hereunder, such Party will promptly tender to the respective Party an amount
equal to such third party recovery or insurance recovery up to the amount of
the applicable indemnity Claim proceeds paid to the indemnified
Person hereunder.

(b) The Parties agree that no indemnified Person shall have any recourse under
this _Article 9_ for any Losses that such indemnified Person would not have
suffered had such indemnified Person exercised Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to mitigate such Losses within a reasonable amount of time following the
discovery by such indemnified Person of the fact, event or circumstance
giving rise to such Losses (and for an indemnified Person that is not a
natural Person, the bringing to the attention of a responsible officer thereof
of such fact, event or circumstance). For the avoidance of doubt, any
expenditures by an indemnified Person to mitigate Losses relating to any
indemnifiable Claim in accordance herewith shall be deemed to constitute
additional Losses incurred in connection with such Claim.

 

Section 9.8. _Materiality_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, each of the representations and warranties in  _Article 3_ or
_Article 4_ that contains any "material", "Material Adverse Effect" or similar
qualifications (other than (a) the "Material Adverse Effect" contained in
_clause (ii)_ of  _Section_ __ _ 3.8,_ (b) the "material" qualifier in the
first sentence of _Section 3.10(a)_ , and (c) the word "Material" in the
defined term "Material Contracts") shall be read as though such
qualifications were not contained therein for the purposes of determining
whether or not an indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this _Article 9_ and the amount of Losses to which such indemnified Person
may be entitled under this _Article 9_.

Section 9.9. _Claims Against Escrow Amount_.

 

(a) Pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)(ii)_, on or prior to the 90th
day following the Closing, Buyer shall pay to the Escrow Agent, in
immediately available funds, for deposit into an

 



79  account designated by the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Account_ "), an amount
equal to the Escrow Amount (such funds once deposited, and any interest or
other earnings thereon, are referred to as the " _Escrow Funds_ "). The
Escrow Funds shall be held and distributed in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, which will be executed at Closing, by
and among Buyer, Seller and the Escrow Agent.

(b) The Escrow Funds shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent as follows:

 

(i) pursuant to _Section 9.9(c)_ and _Section 9.9(d)_ in accordance with
written instructions that are jointly signed by Seller and Buyer, which
instructions shall be in a form that complies with the requirements of the
Escrow Agreement (a " _Joint Instruction Letter_ "); or

 

(ii) pursuant to a final non-appealable order, judgment, decision or decree by
a court of competent jurisdiction specifying the amount of Escrow Funds to be
released and the Person or Persons to whom such Escrow Funds shall be
released.

 

(c) The Parties agree to (i) on the date that is 6 months following the
Closing Date (the " _First Release Date_ ") (or first Business Day
thereafter), execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Instruction
Letter, instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to Seller from the Escrow
Account an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the Escrow Funds as of such
date _less_ the sum of (A) the amount which the Escrow Agent has either
released to Buyer or the Escrow Agent has been validly instructed to release
to Buyer in accordance with the Escrow Agreement but has not actually
released as of the First Release Date _plus_ (B) the reasonable estimated
amount, as determined by Buyer in good faith, of any good faith Claims for
indemnification arising pursuant to _Article 9_ , and which have
been presented to Seller in accordance with _Article 9_ and remain unresolved
or unpaid by Seller as of the First Release Date; (ii) on the date that is 12
months following the Closing Date (the " _Second Release Date_ ") (or
first Business Day thereafter), execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a
Joint Instruction Letter, instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to Seller
from the Escrow Account an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of the Escrow Funds
as of such date _less_ the sum of (A) the amount which the Escrow Agent
between the First Release Date and the Second Release Date has either released
to Buyer or the Escrow Agent has been validly instructed to release to Buyer
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement but has not actually released as of
the Second Release Date _plus_ (B) the reasonable estimated amount, as
determined by Buyer in good faith, of any good faith Claims for
indemnification arising pursuant to _Article 9_ , and which have been
presented to Seller in accordance with _Article 9_ and remain unresolved or
unpaid by Seller as of the Second Release Date; and (iii) on the date that is
18 months following the Closing Date (the " _Final Release Date_ ") (or first
Business Day thereafter), execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint
Instruction Letter, instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to Seller from
the Escrow Account an amount equal to the remainder of the Escrow Funds as of
the Final Release Date _less_ (A) the amount which the Escrow Agent has been
validly instructed to release to Buyer in accordance with the Escrow Agreement
but has not actually released as of the Final Release Date _plus_ (B) the
reasonable estimated amount, as determined by Buyer in good faith, of any good
faith Claims for indemnification arising pursuant to _Article 9_ , and which
have been presented to Seller in accordance with _Article 9_ and remain
unresolved or unpaid by Seller as of the Final Release Date. If it is
subsequently and finally determined that all or a portion of any amount
subject to

 



80  release under this _Section 9.9(c)_ that is withheld pursuant to clauses
(i)(A), (i)(B), (ii)(A), (ii)(B), (iii)(A) or (iii)(B) of this _Section
9.9(c)_ was not owed to Buyer pursuant to _Article 9_ , within five (5) days
after such determination, the Escrow Agent shall release such amount to
Seller. Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent each
Joint Instruction Letter contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ directing
the Escrow Agent to release to Seller that portion of the Escrow Funds to
which Seller is entitled pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_.

 

(d) In the event that Seller becomes obligated to Buyer under the terms of
_Article 9_ in respect of any Losses (as determined by a final order,
judgment or decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or by mutual written
agreement between Buyer and Seller) and at such time there are remaining
Escrow Funds in the Escrow Account, then Seller and Buyer shall execute and
deliver a Joint Instruction Letter to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow
Agent to release to Buyer that portion of the Escrow Funds required to satisfy
such obligation (to the extent the Escrow Funds then remaining in the Escrow
Account are sufficient to satisfy such obligation).

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary and except for a
Warranty Breach with respect to Fundamental Representation and Warranties and
Fraud Claims, and subject to Buyers setoff rights pursuant to _Section
2.4(h)_ of this Agreement, recovery against the Escrow Funds pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.9_ constitutes the Buyer Indemnified Parties sole and
exclusive remedy for any and all Losses relating to or arising from any Claim
for a Warranty Breach that is subject to indemnification under _Section
9.2(a)_.

 

(f) In the event that any Party receives a release of a portion of the Escrow
Funds pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to which it is not entitled pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, such Party shall, (i) if another Party is
entitled to such portion of the Escrow Funds at that time, transfer such funds
to such other Party, or (ii) if no other Party is entitled to such portion of
the Escrow Funds at that time, deposit such funds with the Escrow Agent to be
held and released pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

 

(g) If, either Seller or Buyer shall fail to timely execute and deliver a
Joint Instruction Letter when required under this Agreement, Seller or Buyer,
as applicable, shall be entitled to seek an order, judgment or decision from a
court of competent jurisdiction to direct the Escrow Agent to release to the
applicable Person or Persons the portion of the Escrow Funds to which they
are entitled under this Agreement and to seek to recover losses and
reasonable expenses from Seller or Buyer, as applicable, as a result of such
failure to comply with this Agreement.

 

(h) In the event of a conflict between the Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement, this Agreement shall govern as between Buyer and Seller.

 

Section 9.10. _Fraud_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or
interpreted as limiting a Partys right to seek and receive recovery for
Fraud; _provided_ , that (a) under no circumstances will a Partys liability
for any Losses in respect of Fraud in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement exceed the Purchase Price and (b) any recovery
in respect of Fraud shall be subject to _Section 9.6(c)_.

This _Exhibit A_ sets forth methods, definitions and accounting principles for
calculating the Adjustment Amount for purposes of both determining the
Closing Amount and any post-Closing adjustments to the Closing Amount as set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ of this Agreement. Capitalized terms used in
this _Exhibit A_ but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to
such terms in this Agreement.

Section 1.1 _Calculation of Adjustment Amount_.

 

(a) The " _Adjustment Amount_ " is an amount of Dollars (expressed as a
positive or a negative number, as applicable) equal to (i) the Working
Capital Adjustment _minus_ (ii) the Indebtedness Amount _minus_ (iii) the
Company Transaction Expense Amount.

 

(b) All calculations performed in this _Section_ __ _ 1.1_ will strictly
adhere to the accounting principles set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 1.2_ and
utilize the form of Settlement Statement set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.3_.
All estimated amounts referenced in the following defined terms shall be
determined in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ of this Agreement. As
used herein, the following terms will have the following meanings:

 

(i) " _Normal Working Capital_ " means Current Assets recognized and Current
Liabilities incurred by the Company (without regard to the impact of any such
Current Assets and Current Liabilities would have on the calculation of the
Working Capital Adjustment) operating in the ordinary course of business,
consistent with its past practices and that are (1) reflective of normal,
contractual payment terms and (2) measured based on the application of
generally accepted accounting principles and accounting practices as employed
in the preparation of the Financial Statements. For the purpose of this
Section, Current Assets means accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other
current assets (but not cash or deferred tax assets) and Current Liabilities
means accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

 

(ii) " _Working Capital Adjustment_ " is the net amount of Dollars equal to
Current Assets less Current Liabilities as of the Execution Date that do not
qualify as Normal Working Capital as of the Execution Date, plus cash
contributed to the Company by Seller for the purpose of funding Capital
Expenditures between the Execution Date and the Closing Date.

(iii) " _Capital Expenditures_ " means capital expenditures with respect to
any Company Assets made by the Company in furtherance of construction,
connection, development, completion, expansion, repair or maintenance of the
Company Assets and that are either for (A) well connections made pursuant to
the Earn-Out Contracts in the ordinary course of business consistent with the
Companys past practices, or (B) for the projects described on and consistent
with _Schedule 5.1(p)_.

 



Exhibit A - 1 (iv) " _Company Transaction Expense Amount_ " means the aggregate amount of
all Transaction Expenses of the Company that have been paid after the
Execution Date or that remain unpaid immediately prior to Closing.

 

(v) " _Indebtedness Amount_ " means the aggregate amount of all unpaid
Indebtedness of the Company immediately prior to Closing.

(vi) " _Transaction Expenses_ " means the amount payable by the Company for
all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (a) all fees and
expenses for legal counsel, accounting firms, and other professional
advisors, and (b) any retention, bonus or similar compensatory amounts payable
to any employees or service providers of the Company that become payable by
the Company pursuant to an agreement with the Company, Seller or any of their
Affiliates solely as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 1.2 _Accounting Principles_. The calculations contemplated by this
_Exhibit A_ shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, in a manner consistent
with and using the same accounting methods, practices, principles, policies
and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and valuation and
estimation methodologies used by Seller in the preparation of the Financial
Statements, except as otherwise set forth in the Agreement. All amounts are
denominated in Dollars.

Statement_. The form of Settlement Statement follows on the next page.
