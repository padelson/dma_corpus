<LI>Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section&nbsp;11.05 to the contrary, none of the Purchasers or the Company shall be required to permit ASC to contest any claim; provided, however, that the Tax Indemnifying Parties shall have no obligation to pay, indemnify or reimburse the Purchasers or the Company for any amounts that the Purchasers or the Company pay without the prior approval of ASC (which may be granted or withheld in ASC's sole discretion) with respect to a claim ASC timely elects to contest but is not permitted to contest under this Section&nbsp;11.05(e).</LI>
<LI>Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section&nbsp;11.05 to the contrary, ASC shall not, without the prior written consent of the Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, contained or delayed), settle, compromise or concede any asserted liability unless ASC has (i)&nbsp;paid or otherwise satisfied the asserted liability on or prior to the date of such settlement, compromise or concession, or (ii)&nbsp;obtained, as an unconditional term of such settlement, compromise or concession, an unconditional release, issued by the applicable taxing authority in favor of the Company, for all responsibility in respect of the asserted liability.</LI>
