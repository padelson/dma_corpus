difference between (as further adjusted pursuant to Section 2.03, the "
_Purchase Price_ "):

 

     

 1. $102,000,000; minus
 

 2. the sum of (i) the outstanding principal amount of any Substitute Capital Leases, and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, calculated as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and (ii) the Outstanding Indebtedness (other than the Gondola Financing and the Capital Leases).
 

2.02 _Payment at the Closing_.

  _

 3. Payments by the Purchasers_. At the Closing, the Purchasers shall pay the Purchase Price as follows:
   

 1. The Purchasers shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to HC and HVSR, allocated in the respective percentages and to the respective accounts set forth on _Schedule 2.02(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, an amount equal to the difference between the Purchase Price and the Cash Escrow; and
 

 2. The Purchasers shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the Cash Escrow by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account set forth in the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Sellers shall have delivered one or more Letters of Credit to the Escrow Agent on or prior to the Closing in accordance with Section 2.05, the Purchasers shall (A) reduce the amount to be paid to the Escrow Agent in accordance with this Section 2.02(a)(ii) and (B) pay to HC and HVSR, in accordance with Section 2.02(a)(i) and in addition to the amount described therein, in each case, in an amount equal to the full amount of such Letter(s) of Credit.
  

 4. In addition to the payment of the Purchase Price, the Purchasers shall, at the Closing, pay (or provide immediately available funds in excess of the Purchase Price to the Company and the Company shall pay) in full fifty percent (50%) of any Gondola Taxes and Penalties.
  _

 5. Payments by the Sellers_. Immediately prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall prepay or pay (or provide immediately available funds to the Company and the Company shall prepay or pay) in full:
   

 1. the outstanding principal amount of the Gondola Financing and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, calculated as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, together with fifty percent (50%) of the Gondola Taxes and Penalties; and
 

 2. the outstanding principal amount of any Capital Lease that is not a Substitute Capital Lease, calculated as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Outstanding Capital Lease Amount_ "), together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and one hundred percent (100%) of any prepayment premium or penalty, inducement payment or sales tax or real property transfer tax required to be paid in connection with such prepayment or in respect of the assumption of any Substitute Capital Lease in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Capital Lease Taxes and Penalties_ ").
  

2.03 _Working Capital and EBITDA Adjustments_. The Purchase Price shall be
adjusted as follows:

 

 6. _Working Capital Adjustment_. No later than the fourth Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall prepare and deliver to the Purchasers an officer\'s certificate, certifying as to the estimated Working Capital as of the close of business on the day preceding the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Working Capital Amount_ "), which certificate shall be accompanied by a statement of the Estimated Working Capital Amount prepared from the books and records of the Company in accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Year-End Financial Statements. The Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be increased, on a dollar for dollar basis, to the extent the Estimated Working Capital Amount is greater than negative $5,000,000, or decreased on a dollar for dollar basis, to the extent the Estimated Working Capital Amount is less than negative $5,000,000.
   

 1. _EBITDA Adjustment_. No later than the fourth Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall prepare and deliver to the Purchasers an officer\'s certificate, certifying as to the Company\'s estimated cumulative earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (calculated without taking into account non-recurring items of income and expenses) (" _EBITDA_ "), and attaching a statement thereof, prepared from the books and records of the Company in accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Year-End Financial Statements, (a) for the period from July 30, 2001 to the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Estimated YTD EBITDA Amount_ ") and (b) for the period from November 26, 2001 to the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Estimated STD EBITDA Amount_ "). The Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be reduced by the positive difference or increased by the positive value of the negative difference, in each case on a dollar for dollar basis, between (a) the product of (1) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the number of days that remain in the Company\'s fiscal year as of the Closing Date by (y) 365 multiplied by (2) the sum of (x) the Estimated YTD EBITDA Amount, (y) the product obtained by multiplying the EBITDA amount budgeted (the " _Remaining Seasonal Budgeted Amount_ ") for the period from the Closing Date to April 28, 2002 as set forth in the Company\'s annual budget set forth in _Schedule ARTICLE II(f)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company\'s Budget_ ") by the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Estimated STD EBITDA Amount by (ii) the EBITDA amount budgeted for the period from November 26, 2001 to the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date as set forth in the Company\'s Budget and (z) the EBITDA amount budgeted for the period from April 29, 2002 to July 28, 2002 as set forth in the Company\'s Budget (the " _Remaining Post-Season Budgeted Amount_ ") minus (b) the sum of the Remaining Seasonal Budgeted Amount plus the Remaining Post-Season Budgeted Amount. For purposes of this Section 2.03, if the Closing Date shall occur on any day other than a Monday, the Closing Date, as used to calculate any EBITDA for any period that includes a reference to the Closing Date, shall be deemed to occur on the following Monday.
  

 7. As soon as practicable, but in any event within 60 days after the Closing Date, the Purchasers shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the Sellers a statement (the " _Final Adjustment Certificate_ ") certifying the amount of the (i) Company\'s Working Capital as of the close of business on the day preceding the Closing Date (the " _Final Working Capital Amount_ ") and (ii) the EBITDA for the period (a) from July 30, 2001 to the close of business on the day preceding the Closing Date (the " _Final YTD EBITDA Amount_ ") and (b) from November 26, 2001 to the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Final STD EBITDA Amount_ "), in each case, prepared from the books and records of the Company in accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Year-End Financial Statements. The Final Adjustment Certificate shall certify the amount payable by the Sellers to the Purchasers, or by the Purchasers to the Sellers, pursuant to Section 2.03(e).
 

 8. Upon receipt of the Final Adjustment Certificate, the Sellers shall have the right during the succeeding 30-day period (the " _Review Period_ ") to examine the Final Adjustment Certificate, and all books and records used to prepare such Final Adjustment Certificate. If the Sellers object that the Final Working Capital Amount, the Final YTD EBITDA Amount and/or the Final STD EBITDA Amount was not calculated correctly, they shall so notify the Purchasers in writing (such notice, a " _Disagreement Notice_ ") on or before the last day of the Review Period, setting forth a specific description of the Sellers\' objection and the amount of the adjustment to the Final Working Capital Amount, the Final YTD EBITDA Amount and/or the Final STD EBITDA Amount which the Sellers believe should be made. If no Disagreement Notice is delivered within the Review Period, the Final Adjustment Certificate shall be deemed to have been accepted by the parties hereto. The Purchasers will, and will cause the Company to, provide the Sellers full access (during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice) to the books, ledgers, files, reports and operating records of the Company and the then current employees of the Company, and will fully cooperate in reviewing the Final Adjustment Certificate.
  _

 9. Dispute Resolution_.
   

 1. In the event that a Disagreement Notice is delivered in accordance with Section 2.03(c), the Purchasers and the Sellers shall attempt to resolve the objections set forth therein within 30 days of receipt of such Disagreement Notice. The objections set forth in the Disagreement Notice that are resolved by the Purchasers and the Sellers in accordance with this Section 2.03(d)(i) shall collectively be referred to herein as the " _Resolved Objections_." The Final Working Capital Amount, the Final YTD EBITDA Amount and/or the Final STD EBITDA Amount shall be adjusted to reflect any Resolved Objections.
 

 2. If the Purchasers and the Sellers are unable to resolve all the objections set forth in the Disagreement Notice within such 30-day period, they shall jointly appoint KPMG (or any successor thereof) within five days of the end of such 30-day period (the " _CPA Firm_ "). The CPA Firm, acting as experts and not as arbitrators, shall review the objections set forth in the Disagreement Notice that are not Resolved Objections (collectively, the " _Differences_ "). The CPA Firm shall determine, based on the requirements set forth in this Section 2.03 and only with respect to Differences submitted to the CPA Firm, whether and to what extent the Final Working Capital Amount, the Final YTD EBITDA Amount and/or the Final STD EBITDA Amount requires adjustment so as to be calculated in accordance with this Agreement. The CPA Firm shall be instructed to make its determination within 15 days after its appointment. The Purchasers and the Sellers shall each pay 50% of the fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm. The Purchasers and the Sellers shall, and the Purchasers shall cause the Company to, provide to the CPA Firm full cooperation. The CPA Firm\'s resolution of the Differences shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties, except in the case of manifest error. The Differences as resolved by the CPA Firm in accordance with this Section 2.03(d)(ii) shall collectively be referred to herein as the " _CPA-Determined Differences_." The Final Working Capital Amount, the Final YTD EBITDA Amount and/or the Final STD EBITDA Amount shall be adjusted to reflect any CPA-Determined Differences.
  

 10. To the extent that the Final Working Capital Amount, the Final YTD EBITDA Amount and/or the Final STD EBITDA Amount set forth in the Final Adjustment Certificate (after taking into account any Resolved Objections and CPA-Determined Differences) differ from the Estimated Working Capital Amount, the Estimated YTD EBITDA Amount and/or the Estimated STD EBITDA Amount, the adjustment to the Purchase Price initially made pursuant to Section 2.03(a) shall be recalculated by the parties in accordance with Section 2.03(a) by using the Final Working Capital Amount, the Final YTD EBITDA Amount and/or the Final STD EBITDA Amount in lieu of the Estimated Working Capital Amount, the Estimated YTD EBITDA Amount and/or the Estimated STD EBITDA Amount, respectively.
 

 11. On the fifth day following (or, if not a Business Day, on the next Business Day) the latest to occur of (x) the 30th day following receipt by the Sellers of the Final Adjustment Certificate, (y) the resolution by the Purchasers and the Sellers of all objections set forth in the Disagreement Notice, if any, and (z) the resolution by the CPA Firm of all Differences, if any, the recalculation required by Section 2.03(e) shall be made and the Purchasers shall pay to the Sellers the amount of any increase in the Purchase Price beyond that received by the Sellers at the Closing, or the Sellers shall return to the Purchasers the excess amount of the Purchase Price initially received by the Sellers at the Closing. Such payment shall be made (i) in the case of a payment to the Purchasers, by the Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account or accounts designated by the Purchasers and (ii) in the case of a payment to the Sellers, by the Purchasers by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account or accounts designated by the Sellers.
 

2.04 _Payments in Respect of Real Estate_. The parties acknowledge that (i) at
or prior to the Closing, and as further provided in Section 9.10, the
California Base Parcel shall be transferred to the Company by ASC Real Estate
Affiliate and (ii) $2,000,000 of the Purchase Price is attributable to the
value of such real estate.

 

2.05 _Escrow_. Subject to Article X and the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement, the Cash Escrow shall be retained by the Escrow Agent to satisfy
indemnity claims until eighteen months following the Closing Date (the "
_Escrow Termination Date_ "). Upon the Escrow Termination Date, the Escrow
Agent shall deliver to Sellers, allocated in the respective percentages set
forth on _Schedule 0(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, all remaining
cash held in escrow; _provided_ , _however_ , that the amounts may be withheld
with respect to unsatisfied claims until the resolution of such claims in
accordance with Articles X and XI and the Escrow Agreement. At any time on or
prior to the Closing and at any time and from time to time following the
Closing, the Sellers may deliver to the Escrow Agent one or more irrevocable
and unconditional letters of credit in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Parent (each, a " _Letter of Credit_ ") issued by a commercial bank organized
under the laws of the United States of America of recognized good standing and
reasonably acceptable to the Parent.

representations and warranties of the Sellers and the Company contained herein
shall be true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same force
and effect as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except for those
representations and warranties that are expressly limited by their terms to
dates or times other than the Closing Date, which representations and
warranties need only be true and correct as of such other date or time),
except where the failure to be true and correct would not, individually or in
the aggregate with all other such failures, have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. The Sellers and the Company shall have performed and complied in
all material respects with all material covenants and agreements required
hereby to be performed or complied with by them on or prior to the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the Sellers to comply with
the covenants set forth in Section 9.15 shall only constitute a failure of
this Section 7.01 in the event that such failure results in the non-disclosure
of an event, fact or circumstance that has had or would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. ASC shall have delivered to the Parent a certificate, dated the date
of the Closing and signed by an officer of ASC, to the foregoing effect.

 75. A consent by the South Tahoe Redevelopment Agency to the sale of the Interests to the Purchasers under the Master Disposition and Development Agreement identified on _Schedule 3.05_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _MDDA_ ") shall have been obtained (which consent shall not impose any materially burdensome conditions upon the Purchasers or the Company, provided that the Purchasers acknowledge and agree that the conditions set forth in the MDDA as of the date hereof shall be deemed not to be materially burdensome), or a certificate of completion under Section 11.03 of the MDDA shall have been issued to the Company.

The Sellers and the Purchasers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Capital Lease Lenders to agree to accept the Substitute Capital Leases and, in the event of such agreement, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Capital Lease Lenders, at or simultaneously with the Closing, the Substitute Capital Leases; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Capital Lease Lender requires the payment of a fee or other consideration for accepting a Substitute Capital Lease, the Sellers shall, at their election and in accordance with Section 2.02(b), either (i) pay such fee or other consideration or (ii) elect to have such Capital Lease prepaid at Closing.
 

 103. Following the Closing, ASC shall permit the Company to use all items of ski and snowboard rental equipment utilized by the Company prior to the Closing which is subject to a lease with ASC or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company) at a cost equal to ASC\'s or such Affiliate\'s cost under the applicable leases therefor, through the end of the 2001/2002 ski season.
 

 104. The Purchasers agree to cause the Company to honor ASC\'s obligations under the Promotional Contracts and multi-resort passes through the end of the 2001/2002 ski season.

 106. To the extent that, following the Closing, the Company shall not be able to continue to use any of the licenses set forth on _Schedule 9.05(l)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Sellers agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts (excluding the payment of money or the delivery of any item of value) to assist the Company in replacing such licenses and/or to provide the Company with the benefits of such licenses.

Except as specifically provided herein, each Purchaser agrees that it shall not hereafter permit the Company to adopt or use any trade name, trademark or service mark incorporating any of the Seller Trade Names or any trade name, trademark or service mark likely to indicate endorsement or sponsorship by, or any connection with, the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, including the name or mark "American Skiing" or any name or mark similar thereto.

9.07 _Confidentiality; Publicity_. Each party shall (and ASC shall cause the
Company to) hold, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its employees and agents to hold, in strict confidence all information
concerning the other parties or their Affiliates furnished to it by such other
Persons, all in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, as if
originally a party thereto who was required to keep information confidential
except that the Sellers shall maintain such information with respect to the
Company as confidential only to the extent such information is specific to the
Company and does not relate to the operations of the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates following the Closing Date. Any release to the public of
information with respect to the matters contemplated by this Agreement
(including any termination of this Agreement) shall be made only in the form
and manner approved jointly by ASC and the Parent, provided that if a party is
required by law to make any disclosure concerning such matters, such party
shall discuss in good faith with the other party the form and content of such
disclosure prior to its release (but such release shall not require the prior

and Article XI, for a period of six (6) months following the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall, and the Purchasers shall and shall cause the Company to,
cooperate in good faith to effect an orderly transition in the operation of
the Business (including, subject to the consent of ASC\'s applicable software
licensors (which Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain), permitting the Purchasers\' use of the Sellers\' general ledger),
provided, that neither party shall be required to expend any funds or enter
into any contractual commitments in performing its obligations under this
Section 9.08.

 

9.09 _Access to Records After the Closing_. The Sellers and the Purchasers
recognize that subsequent to the Closing they may have information and
documents which relate to the Company, the Business, its employees, its
properties and Taxes and to which the other party may need access subsequent
to the Closing. Each such party shall provide the other such party and its
Representatives full access, during normal business hours on reasonable notice
(and at such other times as such other party reasonably requests) and under
reasonable circumstances, to all such information and documents, and to
furnish copies thereof, which such other party reasonably requests. The
Purchasers and the Sellers agree that prior to the destruction or disposition
of any such books or records pertaining to the Company at any time within five
(5) years (or, in any matter involving Taxes without the prior written consent
of all other parties to this Agreement) after the Closing Date, each such
party shall provide not less than thirty (30) calendar days prior written
notice to the other such party of any such proposed destruction or disposal.
If the recipient of such notice desires to obtain any such documents, it may
do so by notifying the other party in writing at any time prior to the
scheduled date for such destruction or disposal. Such notice must specify the
documents which the requesting party wishes to obtain. The parties shall then
promptly arrange for the delivery of such documents. All out-of-pocket costs
associated with the delivery of the requested documents shall be paid by the
requesting party. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the
Related Documents to the contrary, in no event shall the Sellers, their
Affiliates be required to provide the Purchasers with access to or copies of
the Sellers\', or their Affiliates\' Tax Returns to the extent such Tax
Returns do not relate to the Company and in no case shall the Purchasers have
any right to review any Tax Returns other than pro forma Tax Returns of the
Company.

 

9.10 _Real Estate Purchase_. On or prior to the Closing, ASC shall cause the
ASC Real Estate Affiliate to convey fee title to the California Base Parcel to
the Company, by grant deed, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted
Exceptions.

 

9.11 _Interim Operations of the Parent_. Prior to the Closing, unless the
Sellers have otherwise consented in writing thereto, the Parent shall not, and
shall cause the GP Purchaser and the LP Purchaser not to:

 

 111. take any action or omit to take any action for the purpose of directly or indirectly preventing, materially delaying or materially impeding the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
 

 112. directly or indirectly authorize any of, or commit or agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any action or actions which would make the representation of the Purchasers set forth in Section 4.11 of this Agreement untrue or incorrect in any material respect; and
 

 113. enter into any binding agreement to do any of the foregoing.
 

9.12 _No Solicitation_. Unless and until this Agreement shall have been
terminated pursuant to Section 12.01, none of the Sellers or the Company shall
directly or indirectly through any partner, officer, director, employee,
agent, affiliate or otherwise solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of
any proposal or offer from any Person (including any of its officers,
directors, employees and agents) relating to any Competing Transaction, nor
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding a Competing
Transaction. The Sellers and the Company shall immediately cease any and all
contacts, discussions and negotiations with third parties regarding any
Competing Transaction. ASC shall promptly notify the Parent if any written
proposal regarding a Competing Transaction is made and shall provide the
Parent with copies thereof.

 

9.13 _Tax Matters_.

 

 114. The Company, the Sellers, ASC and the Purchasers shall take all action necessary to cause the Company to make an election to adjust the basis of the Company\'s property in the manner provided in Section 754 and 743(b) of the Code, including timely making such election on the Company\'s final return for the period ending on the Closing Date.
 

 115. The Company, the Sellers, and ASC shall take all actions reasonably requested by the Purchasers necessary to amend the limited partnership agreement of the Company prior to the Closing Date by adding the provision set forth in _Schedule ARTICLE IX(nn)_ to such partnership agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties acknowledge that the sale of one-hundred percent (100%) of the partnership interest in the Company will be treated as a technical termination of the Company for federal income tax purposes under Section 708 of the Code.
 

 116. The Sellers and the Purchasers agree that, for the Sellers\' and Purchasers\' respective federal, state and local income tax purposes, the Purchase Price, as determined under Section 2.01 hereof, shall, subject to Section 2.04, be allocated among the assets of the Company as mutually agreed by the Sellers and the Purchasers in a manner consistent with applicable provisions of subchapter K of the Code, as amended, and the regulations thereunder.
   

 1. Within a reasonable period following the date hereof, but in no event less than ten (10) days prior to the Closing, the Parent shall prepare and deliver to ASC a schedule (an " _Allocation Schedule_ ") allocating the sum of the Purchase Price among the assets of the Company, in such amounts reasonably determined by the Parent to be consistent with the foregoing.
 

 2. ASC shall have a period of five (5) Business Days after the delivery of the Allocation Schedule (the " _Response Period_ ") to present in writing to the Parent notice of any objections ASC may have to the allocations set forth therein (an " _Objections Notice_ "). Unless ASC timely objects, such Allocation Schedule shall be binding on the parties without further adjustment, absent manifest error.
 

 3. If ASC shall raise any objections within the Response Period, the Parent and ASC shall negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such dispute. If the parties fail to agree within fifteen days after the delivery of the Objections Notice, then the disputed items shall be resolved by the CPA Firm, or if such firm declines to act in such capacity, by such other firm of independent nationally recognized accountants chosen and mutually accepted by both parties (the " _Accounting Referee_ "), whose determination shall be final and binding on the parties. The Accounting Referee shall resolve the dispute within thirty days after the item has been referred to it. The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by ASC and the Parent.
 

 4. For all Tax purposes, the Purchasers and the Sellers agree to report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement, and that none of them will take any position inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return.
  

9.14 _Compliance with Laws_. The Sellers shall provide the Purchasers with
prompt written notice upon (a) the Company obtaining Knowledge of the
commencement of any investigation or review by any Government Authority with
respect to the Company or (b) receipt of any notice or communication of any
noncompliance with any applicable Laws in any material respect.

 

9.15 _Updating of the Schedules_. Prior to Closing, the Sellers shall be
obligated to update all of the Schedules promptly to correct any material
inaccuracy in any such Schedule (other than to reflect actions or omissions
which do not constitute a violation of the covenants contained in this
Agreement occurring after the date of this Agreement and that would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such modification or update of the
Schedules shall be disregarded and have no effect (a) for the purpose of
determining whether any condition to the Closing set forth in Article VII of
this Agreement has been satisfied or (b) for the purpose of determining
whether the Purchasers are entitled to indemnification under Article X.

 

ARTICLE X 
  
 SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

and IV hereof and the covenants and agreements of the parties contained herein

following the Closing Date, except that (a) the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 3.15 and 3.21 shall continue in full force and effect
thereunder subject to any applicable statute of limitation, (b) the

jurisdiction or (ii) if no action is brought before a court of competent

agreements of the Sellers and the Purchasers contained in this Agreement which
by their terms require action following the Closing shall survive until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitation or, to the extent such
agreements are expressly limited to other dates or times, such agreements
shall survive only to such dates or times.

 

10.02 _Indemnification by the Sellers_. Subject to the terms and limitations
set forth herein, the Sellers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Purchasers and the Company and each of their respective
past, present and future directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives (together, the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from and against
any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, suits, damages, civil
and criminal penalties and fines, costs and expenses, Taxes, levies, imposts,
duties, deficiencies, assessments, charges, penalties, and interest, including
any reasonable attorneys\' fees (" _Indemnifiable Losses_ "), resulting from
or arising out of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
undertaking (to the extent the same survive the Closing pursuant to Section
10.01) of the Sellers contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that for purposes of this Agreement and subject to the other terms and
limitations contained in this Article X, to the extent the matters set forth
on _Schedule 3.17(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule would, absent
disclosure thereof, constitute a breach of Section 3.17, (a) the matters set
forth on _Schedule 3.17(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall, to the
extent that they concern the presence of Hazardous Substances in the soil,
groundwater or surface water at the Resort and the investigation and
remediation thereof, be deemed to constitute a breach of Section 3.17, (b)
notwithstanding clause (a), as to the Wetlands Restoration matter disclosed in
Item 13 of _Schedule 3.17(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Sellers
shall be liable to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to this
Section 10.02 only for 50% of any otherwise Indemnifiable Losses incurred by
the Purchaser Indemnitees in connection therewith and (c) notwithstanding
clause (a), if the environmental remediation referenced in Item 1(b) of
_Schedule 3.17(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is required prior to the
demolition of the Upper Vehicle Maintenance Shop, the presence of Hazardous
Substances in the soil and groundwater below the foundation of the Upper
Vehicle Maintenance Shop shall be deemed a breach of Section 3.17 and if such
remediation is not required prior to the demolition of the Upper Vehicle
Maintenance Shop, such presence of Hazardous Substances shall not be deemed a
breach of Section 3.17 (it being understood that this clause (c) shall not
otherwise limit clause (a) to the extent such Hazardous Substances are not
located under the foundation of the Upper Vehicle Maintenance Shop).

 

10.03 _Indemnification by the Purchasers_. Subject to the terms and
limitations set forth herein, the Purchasers, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers, each of their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and each of the respective past, present and
future directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives of the
Sellers and such Affiliates (together, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ "), from and
against any and all Indemnifiable Losses resulting from or arising out of (a)
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking (to the
extent the same survive the Closing pursuant to Section 10.01) of the
Purchasers contained in this Agreement, (b) any liabilities of the Company for
which HC is liable that arise solely and exclusively as a result of HC being
the general partner of the Company (other than any such liabilities with
respect to which the Sellers are indemnifying the Purchasers pursuant to
Section 10.02) and (c) any of the agreements, covenants or understandings
contained in Section 9.05(i) (the " _Section 9.05 Losses_ ").

 

10.04 _Limitations on Indemnification; Exclusive Remedy_.

 

 117. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers shall not be liable for any Indemnifiable Losses arising out of or based upon a breach or alleged breach of (i) the representations and warranties in Article III or (ii) the covenants and agreements of the Sellers contained in this Agreement, and the Purchaser shall not be liable for any Indemnifiable Losses arising out of or based upon a breach or alleged breach of (a) the representations and warranties in Article IV or (b) the covenants and agreements of the Purchasers contained in this Agreement, in each case unless all Indemnifiable Losses arising out of all such Indemnifiable Losses shall exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate, and then only to the extent of such excess. Further, with respect to Indemnifiable Losses arising out of or based upon breaches or alleged breaches of the representations and warranties in Article III or Article IV, neither the Sellers on the one hand, nor the Purchasers, on the other hand, shall be entitled to indemnification in an aggregate amount in excess of $10,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this Section 10.04(a) shall not apply to (x) any claim by the Purchasers in respect of (a) the Tax matters identified in Article XI or the representation contained in Section 3.21, (b) Section 2.03(f) or (c) the representations contained in Sections 3.07(c), 3.11(b) and 3.16 and (y) any claim by any Seller in respect of (a) the representation contained in Section 4.06, (b) Section 2.03(f) or (c) the Section 9.05 Losses.
 

 118. The Sellers and the Purchasers have agreed that separate standards will apply to the use of the terms "material," "materially," "in all material respects," "in any material respect," "material in financial terms," "Material Impairment" and "Material Adverse Effect" (together, the " _Materiality Terms_ ") for purposes of determining the rights to indemnification under this Article X. For purposes of indemnification, the representations and warranties in Articles III and IV (other than Section 3.07(a) and Section 4.08) shall be construed as if they were not qualified by the Materiality Terms. As so construed, no indemnification for Indemnifiable Losses for any representation or warranty, including any representation or warranty containing a Materiality Term, under Sections 10.02 and 10.04 shall be required unless the untruth or breach of any such representation or warranty applied without the relevant Materiality Terms results in Indemnifiable Losses of $25,000 or more. For indemnification purposes under Sections 3.07(a) and Section 4.08, the Materiality Terms shall each be given their separate meanings in accordance with applicable Law.
 

 119. Following the Closing, in the absence of fraud on the part of the Sellers or the Purchasers, as the case may be, the provisions of this Article X shall be the exclusive remedy for any breach or alleged breach of (i) any representation and warranty contained in Article III or Article IV and (ii) any covenant or agreement to be performed on or prior to the closing Date. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any and all rights, claims and causes of action they may have against any other party or any Affiliate thereof arising under or based upon any statutory or common law or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article X and except with respect to any breach of any covenant or agreement to be performed following the Closing) to the extent relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 

 120. To the extent that a party hereto shall have any obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any other Person hereunder, such obligation shall not include lost profits or other consequential, special, punitive, incidental or indirect damages (and the injured party shall not recover for such amounts), except to the extent such amounts are required to be paid to a third party other than an Indemnified Party or a Person affiliated therewith.
 

10.05 _Defense of Claims_.

 

 121. If a Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), shall receive notice of the assertion of any claim (a " _Notice of Claim_ ") with respect to which a party required to provide indemnification hereunder (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may be obligated under this Agreement to provide indemnification, such Indemnified Party shall give such Indemnifying Party prompt notice thereof (and the Escrow Agent, if the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnitee); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such Notice of Claim shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article X, except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. Such Notice of Claim shall describe the claim in reasonable detail, and, if practicable, shall indicate the estimated amount of the Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained by such Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that such estimate shall not be binding on the Indemnified Party.
 

 122. An Indemnifying Party, at such Indemnifying Party\'s own expense and through counsel reasonably chosen by such Indemnifying Party, may elect to defend any third party claim; and if it so elects, it shall, within twenty (20) Business Days after receiving notice of such third party claim (or sooner, if the nature of such third party claim so requires), notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so, and such Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense of such third party claim. After notice from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of a third party claim, such Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party under this Article X for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ one counsel (and any necessary local counsel) to represent such Indemnified Party and all other Persons entitled to indemnification in respect of such claim hereunder (which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party) if, in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, a conflict of interest between such Indemnified Party and such Indemnifying Party exists in respect of such claim, and in that event (i) the reasonable fees and expenses of one such separate counsel (and any necessary local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties shall be paid by such Indemnifying Party and (ii) each of such Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall have the right to direct its own defense in respect of such claim. If any Indemnifying Party elects not to defend against a third party claim, or fails to timely notify an Indemnified Party of its election, such Indemnified Party may defend, compromise and settle such third party claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such Indemnified Party may, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise any third party claim or consent to the entry of any Judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnifying Party of a written unconditional release from all liability in respect of such third party claim. The Indemnifying Party may defend, compromise and settle any third party claim on such terms as it deems appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Indemnifying Party may, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise any third party claim or consent to the entry of any Judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a written unconditional release from all liability in respect of such third party claim.
 

10.06 _Losses Net of Insurance, etc._ The amount of any loss, liability, cost
or expense for which indemnification is provided under this Article X shall be
net of any amounts actually recovered (after taking into account any increase
in the premium payable pursuant to such policy, to the extent, if any, such
increase results from the action or inaction for which the Indemnified Party
is being indemnified) by the Indemnified Party under an insurance policy with
respect to such loss, liability, cost or expense and shall be reduced to take
account of the aggregate Tax benefit(s) realized by the Indemnified Party
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such loss, liability, cost or
expense.

 

10.07 _Section 9.05(m) Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Article X to the contrary, in the event that the Release is not obtained, the
Purchasers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Sellers for any Indemnifiable Losses suffered by any Seller Indemnitee
arising out of any breach or default by the Company under the Section 9.05(m)
Agreement, and the Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchasers and the Company from any Indemnifiable Losses suffered
by any Purchaser Indemnitee arising out of any breach or default under any
agreement that is cross-defaulted with the Section 9.05(m) Agreement, in
either case, other than as a result of the failure to obtain the consent
required by the Section 9.05(m) Agreement to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE XI 
  
 TAX MATTERS

 

11.01 _Tax Indemnification_.

 

 123. Subject to Section 13.03, from and after the Closing Date, the Sellers, jointly and severally (for purposes of this Article XI only, the " _Tax Indemnifying Parties_ "), shall be responsible for, shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchasers and the Company and reimburse the Purchasers and the Company for the following Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes have not been paid as of the Closing Date and are not reflected in the determination of Working Capital: (i) all Taxes imposed on the Company or the Purchasers as a result of becoming a partner of the Company with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date; (ii) with respect to taxable years or periods beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date, all Taxes imposed on the Company or the Purchasers as a result of becoming a partner of the Company, which Taxes are allocable to the portion of such taxable year or period ending on the Closing Date (an " _Interim Period_ ") (Interim Periods and any taxable years or periods that end on or prior to the Closing Date being referred to collectively hereinafter as " _Pre-Closing Periods_ "); and (iii) without duplication, any liability for Taxes resulting from a breach of the representations and warranties in Section 3.21; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Tax Indemnifying Parties shall have no obligation to pay, indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Purchasers or the Company for any Taxes taken into account in calculating the Gondola Taxes and Penalties or the Capital Lease Taxes and Penalties.
 

 124. For purposes of this Section 11.01, in order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to any taxable year or period that includes an Interim Period, the parties hereto shall, to the extent permitted under applicable law, elect with the relevant Tax authority to treat for all purposes the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period of the Company. In any case where applicable law does not permit the Company to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period, then, in each such case, the portion of any Taxes that are allocable to the portion of the Interim Period ending on the Closing Date shall be: (i) in the case of Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts, deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year or period ended on the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in subparagraph (i) above that are imposed on a periodic basis, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Interim Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant period.
 

 125. Subject to Section 11.05 and the limitations contained in Section 11.03(b), payment of any amount by the Tax Indemnifying Parties under this Section shall be made within ten (10) days following written notice by any Purchaser or the Company to ASC that the Tax Indemnifying Parties are required to pay such amounts to the appropriate Tax authority; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Tax Indemnifying Parties shall not be required to make any payment to any Purchaser or the Company hereunder earlier than five (5) Business Days before it is due to the appropriate Tax authority.
 

 126. All matters relating in any manner to Tax indemnification obligations and payments shall be governed exclusively by this Article XI.
 

11.02 _Tax Refunds_. The Purchasers shall pay to ASC, HC or HVSR, as the case
may be, all refunds or credits of Taxes received by any Purchaser or the
Company after the Closing Date and attributable to Taxes paid by the Company
(or any predecessor of the Company) with respect to a Pre-Closing Period, net
of any Taxes imposed on such refund amount, and adjusted to reflect any Tax
benefit received by the Purchasers or the Company in connection with the
accrual or payment of amounts pursuant to this Section 11.02.

 

11.03 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes_.

 

 127. ASC shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns with respect to each of the Company for any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date to the extent such Tax Returns are required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent with the prior practice of the Company (including, without limitation, prior Tax elections and accounting methods or conventions made or utilized by the Company), except as required by a change in the applicable law or regulations.
 

 128. The Purchasers shall prepare and timely file or cause the Company to prepare and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed after the Closing Date other than Tax Returns described as the responsibility of ASC in Section 11.03(a). All such Tax Returns with respect to Pre-Closing Periods shall be prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent with the prior practice of the Company (including prior Tax elections and accounting methods or conventions made or utilized by the Company), except as required by a change in the applicable law or regulations. The Purchasers shall deliver all such Tax Returns with respect to Pre-Closing Periods to ASC for ASC\'s review at least forty-five (45) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of any such Tax Return. If ASC disputes any item on such Tax Return, it shall notify the Purchasers of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its objection. The parties shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which the Tax Return is required to be filed. If the parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to ASC and the Purchasers. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by ASC and the Purchasers.
 

11.04 _Tax Cooperation_.

 

 129. ASC and the Purchasers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to books and records), and assistance relating to the Company as is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax Returns, for the preparation of any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding related to any proposed adjustment. Any information obtained under this Section 11.04(a) shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.
 

 130. The Purchasers agree that with respect to Pre-Closing Periods, they shall not, on or after the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of ASC, amend any Tax Return, or waive or extend any statute of limitations.
 

11.05 _Tax Audits_.

 

 131. After the Closing, the Purchasers shall notify ASC in writing (a " _Tax Notice_ ") of any demand or claim received by the Purchasers or the Company from any Tax authority or any other party with respect to Taxes for which the Tax Indemnifying parties are liable pursuant to Section 11.01 within ten (10) days of the receipt of such demand or claim by the Purchasers or the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to give such Tax Notice will not affect the rights of the Purchasers or the Company to indemnification under Section 11.01 unless, or except to the extent that, but for such failure, the Tax Indemnifying Parties could have reduced, avoided, or contested the Tax liability in question in whole or in part. Such Tax Notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known) describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any Tax authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability.
 

 132. Subject to the following sentence, ASC may elect to control the conduct, through counsel of ASC\'s own choosing and at ASC\'s own expense, of any audit, claim for refund, or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted liability with respect to which indemnity may be sought under Section 11.01, including any contest in respect of an Interim Period (any such audit, claim for refund, or proceeding relating to an asserted Tax liability is referred to herein as a " _Contest_ "); provided that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Parent). If ASC elects to control a Contest, ASC shall within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the Tax Notice notify the Parent in writing of its intent to do so; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchasers and the Company are authorized to file any motion, answer or other pleading that may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to protect their interests during such 30 day period. If ASC properly elects to control a Contest, then ASC shall have all rights to settle, compromise and/or concede such asserted liability and the Purchasers shall cooperate and shall cause the Company (and any of its successors) to cooperate in each phase of such Contest. If ASC does not elect to control the Contest, the Purchasers or the Company may, without affecting its or any other indemnified party\'s rights to indemnification under this Article XI, assume and control the defense of such Contest with participation by the Sellers.
 

 133. In the event that a Contest involves both a pre-Closing period and a post-Closing period (a " _Straddle Contest_ "), the parties shall endeavor to cause the Contest proceeding to be separated into two or more separate proceedings, each of which involves exclusively pre-Closing periods or post-Closing periods. In the event that such separation cannot, after diligent efforts, be achieved, the Purchasers and ASC shall jointly control the Straddle Contest; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to this Section 11.05 generally, the Purchasers shall have all rights to make decisions, settle, compromise and/or concede such asserted liability as relates to a post-Closing period, and ASC shall have all rights to settle, compromise and/or concede such asserted liability as relates to a pre-Closing period.
 

 134. With respect to a Contest that is described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section, and which relates to Taxes other than income Taxes, franchise Taxes, and Transfer and Recording Taxes, ASC\'s ability to settle, compromise and/or concede any asserted liability shall be subject to the Parent\'s consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if ASC\'s proposed settlement, compromise or concession would adversely affect such Tax liability of the Company in a post-Closing period; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Parent does not provide ASC with such consent, ASC shall pay to the Parent the amount that ASC was willing to pay the Taxing authority to settle the asserted Tax liability, and ASC shall be released by the Parent from all indemnification obligations thereto pursuant to Section 11.01 and the Parent shall assume control over the conduct of such Contest and shall have all rights if such Contest does not involve any issues for which ASC remains liable under this Article XI to make decisions, settle, compromise, and/or concede such asserted liability.
 

 135. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 11.05 to the contrary, none of the Purchasers or the Company shall be required to permit ASC to contest any claim; provided, however, that the Tax Indemnifying Parties shall have no obligation to pay, indemnify or reimburse the Purchasers or the Company for any amounts that the Purchasers or the Company pay without the prior approval of ASC (which may be granted or withheld in ASC\'s sole discretion) with respect to a claim ASC timely elects to contest but is not permitted to contest under this Section 11.05(e).
 

 136. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 11.05 to the contrary, ASC shall not, without the prior written consent of the Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, contained or delayed), settle, compromise or concede any asserted liability unless ASC has (i) paid or otherwise satisfied the asserted liability on or prior to the date of such settlement, compromise or concession, or (ii) obtained, as an unconditional term of such settlement, compromise or concession, an unconditional release, issued by the applicable taxing authority in favor of the Company, for all responsibility in respect of the asserted liability.
 

11.06 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payment_. The parties agree to treat
any indemnity payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the
purchase price for all Tax purposes.
