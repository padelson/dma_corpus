by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof.

(b) _Working Capital Adjustment_.

(i) For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the term " _Working Capital_
" shall mean (x) the value of the current assets of the categories described
on _Schedule E_ hereto of the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Assets,
minus (y) the value of the current liabilities of the categories described
on  _Schedule F_ hereto of the Acquired Companies and included in the
Assumed Liabilities.

(ii) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within sixty (60) calendar
days following the Closing, Seller shall cause to be prepared and delivered to
the Buyer a statement (the " _Statement of Working Capital_ ") setting forth
the Working Capital as of the Closing (the " _Closing Working Capital_ ").
The Statement of Working Capital will be prepared in accordance with GAAP,
applied on a basis consistent with the application of such principles in the
preparation of the Business Financial Statements except that (A) no cash or
cash equivalents shall be included as current assets, (B) no transfer costs

liabilities related to health flexible spending and dependant care



 

-8- assistance accounts of the Business Employees shall be reflected net of any
positive balances in the Business Employees health flexible spending and
dependant care assistance accounts as of the Closing Date. Seller will, upon
Buyers written request and subject to the execution by Buyer of a customary
confidentiality agreement, make available to Buyer and its auditors a copy of
all work papers and other books and records utilized by Seller in the
preparation of the Statement of Working Capital.

(iii) Subject to Section 2.3(b)(iv) hereof, within twenty (20) calendar days
following delivery of the Statement of Working Capital pursuant to Section
2.3(b)(ii) hereof, (A) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, that $0
exceeds the Closing Working Capital reflected in the Statement of Working
Capital, or (B) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, that the Closing
Working Capital reflected in the Statement of Working Capital exceeds $0, in
either case, plus interest calculated at the Prime Rate from the date of the
Closing until the date of such payment. Any and all payments made pursuant to
this Section 2.3(b)(iii) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the party to receive
such payment. Any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.3(b)(iii) shall be
deemed to be an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(iv) If Buyer disagrees in good faith with the Statement of Working Capital,
then Buyer shall notify Seller in writing (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ ")
of such disagreement within thirty (30) calendar days following delivery of
the Statement of Working Capital. If Seller has not received a Notice of
Disagreement within such thirty (30) day period, Buyer shall be deemed to
have accepted the Statement of Working Capital. Any Notice of Disagreement
shall set forth in reasonable detail the adjustments Buyer proposes to make to
the Statement of Working Capital and the basis therefor and shall be
consistent with the provisions of Section 2.3(b)(ii). Thereafter, Seller and
Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve and finally determine the amount
of the Closing Working Capital. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the
disagreement within thirty (30) calendar days following delivery of the
Notice of Disagreement, then Seller and Buyer shall select a mutually
acceptable, nationally recognized independent accounting firm that does not
then have a relationship with Seller or Buyer (the " _Independent Accountant_
"), to resolve the disagreement and make a determination with respect thereto.
If Seller and Buyer are unable, within ten (10) calendar days, to select a
mutually acceptable Independent Accountant, then each of Seller and Buyer
shall select a nationally recognized independent accounting firm that does not
have a relationship with Seller or Buyer and these two firms will choose a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm that does not have
a relationship with Seller or Buyer who will serve as the Independent
Accountant. The determination of the Independent Accountant to resolve the
disagreement between Seller and Buyer as to the Statement of Working Capital
will be made, and written notice thereof given to Seller and Buyer, within
thirty (30) calendar days after the selection of the Independent Accountant.
The determination by the Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon Seller and Buyer. The scope of the Independent Accountants
engagement (which will not be an audit) shall be limited to the resolution of
the disputed items described in the Notice of Disagreement, and the
recalculation, if any, of the Statement of Working Capital in light of such
resolution. If an Independent Accountant is engaged pursuant to this Section
2.3(b)(iv), the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne
equally by



 

-9- Seller and Buyer. Within ten (10) calendar days after delivery of a notice of
determination by the Independent Accountant as described above, any payment
required by Section 2.3(b)(iii) hereof shall be made, based on such
determination.

(c)  _Allocation of Purchase Price to the Shares and Acquired Assets_. As
soon as practicable after the Closing Date and at least sixty (60) days prior
to the due date for filing of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 by either
party, Seller shall provide Buyer with a draft of Internal Revenue Service
Form 8594 allocating the consideration payable under Section 2.3(a). Buyer
shall review such Form 8594 and provide any proposed revisions to Seller at
least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of such Form 8594 for either
party. Buyer and Seller agree to negotiate in good faith with respect to such
proposed revisions and to attempt to resolve any differences between the
parties. In the event the parties reach agreement as to the information to be
reflected on such Form 8594, the Form 8594 shall be revised and timely filed
by each party as required by Law. Each of Buyer and Seller shall report the
allocation (and any adjustments thereto) for Tax purposes and file its Tax
Returns (including Form 8594) in a manner consistent with any mutually-agreed
allocations determined pursuant to this Section 2.3(c). In the event the
parties do not reach agreement on the information to be reflected on the Form
8594, each party shall provide to the other party its final version of its
Form 8594 and shall timely file its final version of such Form 8594 in the
manner required by Law.

2.4 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Closing, and without further
consideration therefor, (a) Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller
Entities to) execute and deliver to Buyer such further instruments and
certificates of conveyance and transfer as Buyer may reasonably request in
order to more effectively convey and transfer the Shares and Acquired Assets
to Buyer and to put Buyer in operational control of the Business, or for
aiding, assisting, collecting and reducing to possession any of the Acquired
Assets and exercising rights with respect thereto, and (b) Buyer shall execute
and deliver to the Seller Entities such further instruments and certificates
of assumption, novation and release as Seller may reasonably request in order
to effectively make Buyer responsible for all Assumed Liabilities and release
Seller therefrom to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law.

2.5 _Nontransferable Business Contracts_. To the extent that transfer or
assignment hereunder by Seller to Buyer (or one or more of its permitted
assignees as set forth in Section 11.8) of any agreement, contract, binding
understanding, instrument or legally binding commitment or understanding (a "
_Contract_ ") included in the Acquired Assets (an " _Assumed Contract_ ") is
not permitted or is not permitted without the consent of another person, this
Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute an undertaking to assign the same
if such consent is not given or if such an undertaking otherwise would
constitute a breach thereof or cause a loss of benefits thereunder. Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any and all such third
party consents under all Assumed Contracts; _provided, however_ , that Seller
shall not be required to pay or incur any cost or expense to obtain any third
party consent that Seller is not otherwise required to pay or incur in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Assumed Contract. If any
such third party consent is not obtained before the Closing, Seller shall
(and shall cause the other Seller Entities to), for a period of one (1) year
after the Closing and at Buyers expense, use commercially reasonable efforts
to:

 



 

-10- (a) obtain such consent, (b) cooperate with Buyer (or one or more of its
permitted assignees as set forth in Section 11.8) in any reasonable
arrangement designed to provide Buyer or one or more of its permitted
assignees as set forth in Section 11.8) the benefits of the applicable Assumed
Contract and (c) enforce any rights of the Seller Entities under or with
respect to the applicable Assumed Contract against all other persons
(including termination thereof in accordance with the terms thereof upon the
election of Buyer). In addition, if any such third party consent is not
obtained before the Closing, Buyer shall perform the obligations of the
applicable Seller Entity or Acquired Company under such Assumed Contract to
the extent that such obligation would have been an Assumed Liability but for
the fact that such consent has not been so obtained.

2.6 _Closing_. The purchase and sale (the " _Closing_ ") provided for in this
Agreement is subject to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
under the Merger Agreement, and, except to the extent that Buyer and Seller
agree on another time and place, will take place at the offices of Wilson
Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation at 650 Page Mill Road,
Palo Alto, CA 94304, at 10:00 a.m. (local time), as soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, and in any event on a date that is no more than two
business days following the satisfaction and fulfillment or, if permissible
pursuant to the terms hereof, waiver of the conditions contained in Article
8\.

2.7 _Closing Obligations_. At the Closing:

(a) Seller will deliver to Buyer duly executed copies of:

(i) certificates representing the Shares, duly endorsed (or accompanied by
duly executed stock powers), for transfer to Buyer;

certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware;



 

-11- (viii) a certificate of Seller that Seller and each other Seller Entity that

subject to withholding under Section 1445 of the IRC;

(ix) U.C.C. termination statements and releases of mortgages in recordable
form with respect to any recorded Liens in the Acquired Assets described in
Section 4.5;

(x) a Transition Services Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ "); and

(xi) all other instruments or documents as Buyer may reasonably request to
effect the assignment of the Shares and the Acquired Assets as
contemplated hereby.

(b) Buyer will deliver to Seller:

(i) the Purchase Price by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the
accounts specified by Seller;

(ii) duly executed copies of the certificates pursuant to clauses (a) and (b)
of Section 8.3;

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER CONCERNING THE BUSINESS

Except as disclosed in Knight Ridders Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 25, 2005 (except for the portions of the Form 10-K
identified therein as risk factors or forward looking statement safe
harbors), in Knight-Ridders amendment on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on
April 14, 2006, in Knight Ridders Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended March 26, 2006 (except for the portions of the Form 10-Q
identified therein as risk factors or forward looking statement safe harbors),
or in the disclosure schedules delivered by Seller to Buyer immediately prior
to the execution of this Agreement (it being agreed that any information
set forth in one section of such disclosure schedules shall be deemed to
apply to each other section thereof to which its relevance is reasonably
apparent) (the " _Seller Disclosure Schedules_ "), Seller  



 

-12-  represents and warrants to Buyer to its knowledge and based solely on the
representations and warranties made by Knight Ridder to Seller in Article III
of the Merger Agreement (it being understood and agreed that Seller, as of
the date hereof, does not own and has never operated the Business) as follows:

3.1 _Qualification; Organization; Subsidiaries, etc_. Each of the Acquired
Companies is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and
has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing,
qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect. As
used in this Agreement, any reference to any facts, circumstances, events or
changes having a " _Business Material Adverse Effect_ " means such facts,
circumstances, events or changes that are, or would reasonably be expected to
become, materially adverse to the business, financial condition or continuing
operations of the Business taken as a whole but shall not include facts,
circumstances, events or changes (a) generally affecting the newspaper
industry in the United States or the economy or the financial or securities
markets in the United States or elsewhere in the world, including regulatory
and political conditions or developments (including any outbreak or escalation
of hostilities or acts of war or terrorism) or (b) resulting from (i) the
announcement or the existence of, or compliance with, this Agreement or the
Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including
the effect of the announcement of, or the existence of the plan to make, the
Proposed Divestitures (as defined in the Merger Agreement) ( _provided_  that
the exception in this clause (b)(i) shall not apply to the representations and
warranties contained in Section 4.2(c) to the extent that the execution of
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
would result in any of the consequences set forth in clauses (i) or (ii) of
such section), (ii) any litigation arising from allegations of a breach of
fiduciary duty or other violation of applicable Law relating to the Merger
Agreement or this Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or
hereby or (iii) changes in applicable Law, GAAP or accounting standards. No
Acquired Company is in violation of any of the provisions of its respective
articles or certificate of incorporation and by-laws, except as would not
have a Business Material Adverse Effect. All the outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in the Acquired Companies have been
validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, owned directly or
indirectly by Knight Ridder (or following the Effective Time, Seller), free
and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens, including any restriction
on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or
other ownership interests, except for restrictions imposed by applicable
securities laws.

3.2 _Capital Structure_. 

(a) All outstanding shares of capital stock of each Acquired Company are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free of pre-
emptive rights. Other than the Acquired Companies, there are no Seller
Entities the operations of which are primarily devoted to the conduct of the
Business.



 

-13- (b) There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
convertible securities or other similar rights, agreements or commitments
relating to the issuance of capital stock or other equity interests to which
any Acquired Company is a party obligating any Acquired Company to (i) issue,
transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity interests of
such Acquired Company or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
shares or equity interests, (ii) grant, extend or enter into any such
subscription, option, warrant, call, convertible securities or other similar
right, agreement, arrangement or commitment to repurchase, (iii) redeem or
otherwise acquire any such shares of capital stock or other equity interests,
or (iv) provide a material amount of funds to, or make any
material investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise) in, any of its Subsidiaries. There are no outstanding or authorized
stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation or other similar stock
or other equity-based rights of any Acquired Company.

(c) No Acquired Company has any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations, the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the shareholders of such Acquired Company on any matter.

(d) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
any Acquired Company is a party with respect to the voting of the capital
stock or other equity interest of such Acquired Company. 

3.3 _Business Financial Statements_. Attached to Section 3.3 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules is a true, correct and complete copy of the unaudited
statement of assets and liabilities of the Business as of December 25, 2005,
and the related unaudited statements of revenues and expenses for the twelve
(12) month period then ended (the " _Business Financial Statements_ "). The
Business Financial Statements are derived from the books and records of Knight
Ridder and the audited consolidated financial statements of Knight Ridder
(which were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ")), and fairly present, in all material
respects, the assets and the liabilities of the Business as of the dates
thereof, and the results of operations of the Business for the periods then
ended.

nature, in each case, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that

in the notes thereto), other than those which would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect.

3.5 _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

(a) Each Acquired Company, and, with respect to the Business, each Seller
Entity is in compliance with and is not in default under or in violation of
any applicable federal, state, local or foreign constitution, law, statute,

requirement issued, enacted, adopted, promulgated, implemented or otherwise
put into effect by or under the authority of any Governmental Entity
(collectively, " _Laws_ " and each, a " _Law_ "), except where such non-
compliance, default or violation would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each Acquired Company and with respect to the Business, each Seller
Entity, is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses,
permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals
and orders of any Governmental Entity necessary for each Seller Entity and
each Acquired Company to own, lease and operate its properties and assets or
to carry on the Business as it is now being conducted (the " _Seller Permits_
"), except where the failure to have any of Seller Permits would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect. All
Seller Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in
full force and effect would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Business Material Adverse Effect.

3.6 _Environmental Laws and Regulations_.

(a) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Business
Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Seller Entities and the Acquired Companies
have conducted the Business in compliance with all applicable Environmental
Laws (as hereinafter defined), (ii) no Hazardous Substance (as hereinafter

the Seller Entities, as a result of any activity of any Seller Entity or any
Acquired Company during the time such properties were owned, leased or

Without limitation of its rights under Article 8 and Article 9, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that Seller does not currently operate or control
Knight Ridder or any Subsidiary thereof, any Acquired Company or the Business
and has only the limited contractual rights with regard to the conduct of
Knight Ridder as are set forth in the Merger Agreement. Buyer and its
representatives have had an opportunity, prior to the execution of this
Agreement by Buyer, to review the terms of the Merger Agreement, and Buyer
understands that the limited contractual rights granted by Knight Ridder under
the Merger Agreement: (a) address the conduct of the business of Knight Ridder
and its Subsidiaries as a whole and not the Business or the Acquired
Companies separately, (b) are subject to materiality (or "material adverse
effect") thresholds related to the business of Knight Ridder and its
Subsidiaries as a whole which are inherently higher thresholds of materiality
than materiality (or "material adverse effect") with respect to the Business
or the Acquired Companies, (c) are solely contractual in nature and (d) may be
subject to dispute or differing interpretations as to their meaning or
import. For these and other reasons, Buyer understands and agrees, without
limitation of its rights under Article 8 and Article 9, that, prior to the
Effective Time, although Seller has agreed herein to exercise its contractual
rights under the Merger Agreement so as to use commercially reasonable efforts
to require that Knight Ridder or its Subsidiaries take or refrain from taking
certain actions, Seller does



 

-28- not possess sufficient rights to cause Knight Ridder or its Subsidiaries
(including the Acquired Companies) to act or refrain from acting as may be
contemplated by this Agreement and, in fact, is ultimately unable to cause
Knight Ridder or its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) to take
or refrain from taking any action whatsoever. Accordingly, it is acknowledged
and agreed that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary but without
limitation of Buyers rights under Article 8 and Article 9, Seller shall have
no liability, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatsoever, arising from
or relating to any action or failure to act on the part of Knight Ridder or
any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies)
which occurs, commences or is agreed to prior to the Effective Time. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.1 shall relieve Seller of
its obligations set forth in Section 6.2(c).

6.2  _Conduct of Business by the Acquired Companies_.

(a) From and after the date hereof and prior to the Closing or the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section 9.1
(the " _Termination Date_ "), and except (i) as may be required by applicable
Law, (ii) as may be agreed in writing by Buyer (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (iii) as may be
contemplated or required by this Agreement or (iv) as set forth in Section 6.2
of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, Seller covenants and agrees with Buyer
that (A) (1) prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall exercise its
contractual rights under the Merger Agreement so as to use commercially
reasonable efforts to require that the Business shall be conducted in, and the
Acquired Companies and, with respect to the Business, the Seller Entities,
shall not take any action except in, the ordinary course of business and (2)
following the Effective Time, the Business shall be, conducted in the ordinary
course of business, and (B) prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall
exercise its contractual rights under the Merger Agreement so as to use
commercially reasonable efforts to require that Knight Ridder and its
Subsidiaries, and following the Effective Time, Seller and its Subsidiaries
shall, use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact the present
business organizations of the Acquired Companies and, with respect to the
Business, the Seller Entities, and to preserve their relationships
with significant customers, suppliers, licensors and licensees of the
Business and others with which they have business dealings related to the
Business.

(b) Seller agrees with Buyer, that (x) between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and except as may
be contemplated or required by this Agreement, Seller will exercise its
contractual rights under the Merger Agreement so as to use commercially
reasonable efforts to require that the Acquired Companies (and, solely with
respect to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (ix), (x), (xii), (xv), (xvi) and,
solely with respect to the foregoing, (xvii), of this Section 6.2(b), the
Seller Entities with respect to the Business) and (y) following the Effective
Time until the Closing, without the prior written consent of Buyer (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and
except as may be contemplated or required by this Agreement, Seller will
require that the Acquired Companies (and, solely with respect to clauses
(ii), (iii), (iv), (ix), (x), (xii), (xv), (xvi) and, solely with respect to
the foregoing, (xvii), of this Section 6.2(b), the Seller Entities with
respect to the Business):

distributions paid or made in the ordinary course of business or (B) split,
combine or reclassify any of its capital stock or issue or authorize or

control and/or severance protection by more than 5% from the level at which

provide for payments not in excess of $250,000 per individual and, _provided_
, _further_ , that the total aggregate payments under all such agreements
shall not exceed $2,500,000), (D) except as permitted pursuant to clause (B)
above, establish, adopt, enter into or amend any Benefit Plan, collective
bargaining agreement, plan, trust, fund, policy or arrangement for the benefit
of any Business Employees, except, in each case, as would not result in a
material increase in cost, or (E) hire, promote, demote or otherwise change
the employment status ( _e_. _g_., part-time, full-time, leave), title or
other material term or material condition of employment of any individual who
is (or would become after such hiring, promotion, demotion or change) a
publisher or executive editor who is a Business Employee; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller, Knight Ridder or any
Acquired Company may pay "stay bonuses" in accordance with the provisions
outlined in Section 6.2(b)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules;

by an Acquired Company or, solely to the extent related to the Business, any
Seller Entity, pursuant to the requirements of applicable Laws.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be required to afford such
access if it would unreasonably disrupt the operations of Seller or
the Business, would cause a violation of any agreement to which Seller or an
Acquired Company or Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, would cause a
significant risk, in the reasonable judgment of Seller, of a loss of privilege
to the disclosing party, or any of its Subsidiaries or would constitute a
violation of any applicable Law, nor shall Buyer or any of its Representatives
be permitted to perform any invasive onsite environmental procedure with
respect to any property of any Seller Entity or any Acquired Company.

(b) The parties acknowledge that Seller, Knight Ridder and Buyer have
previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement dated as of April 4, 2006
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement will

Buyer and Seller will hold, and will cause its respective directors,
officers, employees, agents and advisors (including attorneys, accountants,
consultants, bankers and financial advisors) to hold, any Evaluation
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) confidential in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (subject
to, and in accordance with, applicable Law) to (and Seller shall exercise its
contractual rights under the Merger Agreement so as to use commercially
reasonable efforts to require that Knight Ridder and its Subsidiaries) take
promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to
be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that
nothing herein shall require Seller to consummate the Merger), including (i)
the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals, including Seller Approvals and the

registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other

make any required submissions under the HSR Act in connection with this
Agreement, (ii) use best efforts to cooperate with each other in (x)
determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents,

actions, (iii) in the case of Buyer, use best efforts to offer to take, or
cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as
reasonably may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United
States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other person may
assert under Regulatory Law with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
expeditiously possible ( _provided_ that nothing herein shall require Seller
to consummate the Merger), including (A) proposing, negotiating, committing
to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Business and (B) otherwise taking or

of Buyer or its Subsidiaries or affiliates freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its
Subsidiaries businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section

as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. Seller
and Buyer shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental Entity
in connection with Buyers proposed purchase of the Acquired Companies and
Acquired Assets. Each of Seller and Buyer agrees not to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with Buyers proposed purchase of
the Acquired Companies and Acquired Assets unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 6.4, if any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law (as hereinafter defined), each of
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall
use their respective best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_
that nothing herein shall require Seller to consummate the Merger and subject
to clause (y) of the proviso to Section 6.4(b)(iii)). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section
6.4 shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(b) so long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied
with its obligations under this Section 6.4.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means the Sherman Act
of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act of 1914 and all other federal, state or foreign
statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial

forth in the Bank Commitment Letter. Buyer will use all reasonable efforts to
(i) enter into definitive agreements with respect to the financing
contemplated by the Bank Commitment Letter on terms and conditions no less
favorable to Seller in the aggregate than the Bank Commitment Letter as soon
as commercially reasonable but in any event at or prior to the Closing and
(ii) to fully satisfy, on a timely basis, all the terms, conditions,
representations and warranties set forth in such definitive agreements. Buyer
will furnish correct and complete copies of



 

-35- such definitive agreements to Seller promptly upon their execution. Buyer
shall keep Seller informed in reasonable detail with respect to all material
activity concerning the status of the financing contemplated by the Bank
Commitment Letter. Buyer shall not amend, alter or waive, or agree to amend,
alter or waive, the Bank Commitment Letter in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to materially impair or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

6.5 _Tax Matters_.

(a)  _Responsibility for Certain Taxes_. Seller shall indemnify and hold
Buyer and its affiliates (including after the Closing, the Acquired Companies)
harmless against (i) any income, franchise or similar Taxes (" _Income Taxes_
 ") imposed on any Acquired Company with respect to any taxable period (or
portion thereof) of such Acquired Company ending on or before the Closing Date
(each, a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), including without limitation
any Income Taxes attributable to the Section 338(h)(10) Election and any such
Income Taxes imposed upon an Acquired Company as a result of its inclusion in
a consolidated, combined or affiliated group of which any Seller Entity is a
member for any period ending prior to or that includes the Closing Date with
respect to income earned by any Seller Entity prior to or following the
Closing Date, (ii) any Income Taxes imposed on any Seller Entity with respect
to any taxable period (or portion thereof) and (iii) any Taxes not arising
out of or relating to the operation of the Business (x) imposed on any Seller
Entity with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) or (y) imposed
on any Acquired Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. In the
case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing
Date (each, a " _Straddle Period_ "), the Income Taxes imposed upon any
Acquired Company or any Seller Entity allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be computed as if such taxable period ended on the Closing Date;
provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions), other than
with respect to property placed in service after the Closing, shall be
allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after
the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each
period; provided, further, that any benefit attributable to any step-up in
the basis of the assets of an Acquired Company resulting from the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be allocated solely to the portion of the Straddle
Period after the Closing Date. Following the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify
and hold Seller harmless against any Taxes (other than Taxes paid prior to the
Closing that are (i) not attributable to the post-Closing portion of any
Straddle Period or (ii) attributable to the post-Closing period and reflected
on the Statement of Working Capital) imposed on any Acquired Company or
arising out of or relating to the operation of the Business or the Acquired
Assets that are not the responsibility of Seller pursuant to this Section
6.5(a).

(b) _Tax Returns_. Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and filing
of any Tax Return with respect to any Acquired Company or with respect to the
Business or the Acquired Assets that is required to be filed after the Closing
Date, other than any Tax Return for Income Taxes of (i) any Seller Entity with
respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) or (ii) any Acquired
Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a " _Pre-Closing Income Tax
Return_ "). To the extent that Buyer is required to remit any Taxes that are
the responsibility of Seller pursuant 



 

-36- to Section 6.5(a), Seller shall pay to Buyer any such Taxes at least ten (10)
days prior to the due date for payment of such Taxes. Seller shall be
responsible for the preparation and filing of any Tax Return with respect to
any Acquired Company or the Business or the Acquired Assets that is required
to be filed on or before the Closing Date and any Pre-Closing Income Tax
Return, including in each case any amended Tax Return, and each such Tax
Return shall be true and correct and completed in accordance with applicable
law and consistent with past practice. To the extent that Seller is
required to remit any Taxes that are the responsibility of Buyer pursuant to
Section 6.5(a), Buyer shall pay to Seller any such Taxes at least ten (10)
days prior to the due date for payment of such Taxes.

(c) _Tax Contests_. Seller shall control and bear the cost of the conduct of
any audit, claim, dispute or controversy (" _Tax Contest_  ") relating to any
Tax for which Seller is responsible pursuant to Section 6.5(a); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller shall not settle or compromise any such Tax Contest in
a manner that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Tax
liability of Buyer, the Acquired Companies, and their respective affiliates
for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date without the consent of
Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned). Buyer shall control all other Tax Contests relating to any
Acquired Company or the Business or the Acquired Assets. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any Tax Contest involves Taxes for which the Seller is
responsible pursuant to Section 6.5(a) as well as Taxes for which Buyer is
responsible pursuant to Section 6.5(a), the parties shall jointly conduct such
Tax Contest, with each party being entitled to control such Tax Contest
(including with respect to any possible settlements or compromises) with
respect to any issues which could result in liability for which such party is
responsible; to the extent that any such jointly conducted Tax Contest
involves any issue which could result in liability for both parties, the
parties shall jointly control the conduct of the Tax Contest with respect to
such issue, and no settlement or compromise of such issue shall be entered
into without the consent of both parties. Disputes regarding the conduct of
any Tax Contest that is jointly conducted shall be referred to the
Independent Accountant for resolution if the parties are unable to reach
agreement after attempting in good faith to do so; the Independent Accountant
shall take into account the positions of both parties with due regard for the
amount of each partys potential liability.

(d) _Refunds and Credits; Waiver of Carrybacks_. Any refund or credit with
respect to Taxes described in Section 6.5(a) that are the responsibility of
Seller, to the extent such Taxes have been paid or reflected as a liability on
the Statement of Working Capital, shall be for the account of Seller, except
to the extent such refund or credit is reflected as an asset on the Statement
of Working Capital, and if Buyer or any Acquired Company receives any Tax
refund or credit that relates to such Taxes, Buyer shall pay Seller the
amount of any such refund or the value of such credit. Any refunds or credits
with respect to Taxes described in Section 6.5(a) paid by Buyer, except to the
extent such Taxes are reflected as a liability on the Statement of Working
Capital, shall be for the account of Buyer, and if any Seller Entity receives
any Tax refund or credit that relates to such Taxes, Seller shall pay to Buyer
the amount of any such refund or the value of such credit. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, Buyer shall (or shall cause or permit the
Acquired Companies to) elect to relinquish any carryback of a Tax attribute to
any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date. In
cases where Buyer cannot elect to relinquish such carrybacks, no Seller



 

-37- Entity shall have any obligation to pay to Buyer or any Acquired Company any
Tax refund or other amount resulting from a carryback of a post-acquisition
Tax attribute of any Acquired Company into a Pre-Closing Income Tax Return.

(e) _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

(i) Seller and Buyer shall make a timely, irrevocable and effective election
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any similar election under any
applicable state or local Tax law (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10)
Election_ ") with respect to Buyers purchase of the Acquired Companies.

EMPLOYMENT MATTERS

7.1 _Acquired Employees._

(a) Buyer shall, or shall cause one or more of the Acquired Companies to,
offer employment to, or employ all of the Business Employees who are actively
at work on the Closing Date and are employed by Seller or one of its
affiliates (after giving effect to the Merger) other than the Acquired
Companies. Such employment will be effective as of immediately following the
Closing Date. Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies initially to continue
to employ all of the Business Employees who are employed on the Closing Date.
With respect to Business Employees other than Business Employees who are
covered by a collective bargaining agreement (each a " _Union Employee_ " and
collectively, the " _Union Employees_ "), such offers of employment or
continued employment, as the case may be, shall be on terms and conditions
substantially equivalent in the aggregate to those of similarly situated
employees of any Buyer in the same or similar geographic area and business.
Prior to the Closing, neither Seller nor its directors or officers shall
either directly or indirectly, induce or encourage any of the
Business Employees to decline Buyers offers of employment or become employed
by Seller. Such Business Employees who accept such offer of employment and
become employees of Buyer or an Acquired Company or who continue such
employment with the Acquired Companies shall be referred to herein as "
_Acquired Employees_."

(b) Except as otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement or this
Article 7, (i) the Acquired Employees shall cease active participation in the
Benefit Plans effective as of the Closing Date and shall commence
participation in benefit plans maintained by Buyer (or its affiliates)
in accordance with the terms of Buyers (or its affiliates) plans; and (ii)
Seller shall assume sole sponsorship of, and the Acquired Companies shall
withdraw from participation in, the Benefit Plans effective as of the Closing
Date. 

7.2 _Employee Liabilities_. Except as expressly provided otherwise in Section
7.3 or in the Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall be responsible for,
covenants to pay or otherwise discharge, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless, Buyer against any liability, claim or obligation (including

incentive compensation, vacation pay, sick pay, termination pay, severance
pay, pay-in-lieu-of-notice, notice requirements (including any notice
requirements under the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act),

Buyer shall assume (and does hereby assume), shall be responsible for,
covenants to pay or otherwise discharge, and shall indemnify and hold

reasonable attorneys fees) relating to or arising out of the Benefit Plans
covering Business Employees which provide for severance, change in control
payments, or stay bonuses to the extent set forth in Section 7.3 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, to the extent
applicable, Seller shall reimburse, shall be responsible for, covenants to pay

reimburse Buyer for 50% of any stay bonuses actually paid to Business
Employees in accordance with the terms of such program as in effect

ability to amend any term or condition of any such income security agreement,
change of control agreement or stay bonus for a Business Employee in any way
that would increase the potential liability of Seller. Buyer shall notify
Seller within (five) 5 business days of any pending, threatened or actual
claim for payments or benefits under any such income security agreement,
change of control agreement or stay bonus.

7.4 _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. The collective bargaining agreements
covering Business Employees shall be assumed by the Buyer. Seller has made
available to Buyer a complete and correct (to its knowledge and based solely
on the representations and warranties made by Knight Ridder to Seller in
Article III of the Merger Agreement) copy of each such collective bargaining
agreements. Buyer agrees that Buyer shall be responsible for, covenants to
pay or otherwise discharge, and shall indemnify and hold harmless, Seller
against any liability, claim or obligation (including reasonable attorneys

Plan listed in Section 7.5 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule which is a
defined benefit pension plan in which any Union Employee participates under
an applicable collective bargaining agreement, Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate with each other to take such actions as are reasonably necessary to
ensure that the consummation of the transaction described herein does not
result in withdrawal liability assessment for any Multiemployer Pension Plan.

7.8 _Savings Plans_. Seller shall retain all assets and liabilities under,
and assume sole sponsorship of, all Benefit Plans that are defined
contribution savings plans (" _Seller Savings Plans_ "). Buyer shall credit
the service of each Acquired Employee with Knight Ridder or its affiliates,

eligibility and vesting under Buyers savings plan(s). In the case of Union
Employees, Buyer will make or cause the applicable Acquired Company to make
all required contributions under Buyers savings plan(s), if any, as required
under any applicable collective bargaining agreement. Buyer shall take all
steps necessary to permit each such Acquired Employee who has received an

an account(s) under a 401(k) savings plan maintained by Buyer or an Acquired
Company.

unpaid vacation time of Acquired Employees to the extent such liability is not
already a liability of an Acquired Company.

7.10 _Welfare Plans_.

(a) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee welfare benefit plans of
Buyer and its affiliates providing benefits to any Acquired Employees after
the Closing (the " _New Welfare Plans_ "), each Acquired Employee shall
subject to applicable Law, and applicable tax qualification requirements, be
credited with his or her years of service with Knight Ridder or its
affiliates, including the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries, before
the Closing, to the same extent as such Acquired Employee was entitled, before
the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar employee benefit
plan in which such Acquired Employee participated or was eligible
to participate immediately prior to the Closing, provided that the foregoing
shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Acquired Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Welfare Plans if
such Acquired Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a comparable type of welfare
benefit plan of a Seller Entity (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "
), and (ii) for purposes of each New Welfare Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Acquired Employee, Buyer, or, as
applicable, an Acquired Company, shall cause all pre-existing



 

-43- condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Welfare
Plan to be waived for such Acquired Employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the
comparable plans of Knight Ridder or its affiliates, including the Acquired
Companies and their Subsidiaries, in which such Acquired Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing and Buyer shall cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding New Welfare Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Welfare Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Welfare Plan.

(b) To the extent that an Acquired Employee has not used all amounts deferred
to a health flexible spending account plan or a dependent care assistance plan
as of the Closing Date, Seller shall transfer to Buyer, or shall leave in
place at the applicable Acquired Company, in cash any positive balance in
such Acquired Employees health flexible spending and dependent care
assistance account as of the Closing Date to the extent not otherwise included
in the Acquired Assets, and Buyer shall assume all obligations with
respect to that Acquired Employees health flexible spending account plan and
dependent care assistance account balances.

(c) Seller shall retain the Liabilities of Seller and its Subsidiaries, in
excess of $90,000, for the claims incurred by Business Employees prior to the
Closing Date but not paid until after the Closing Date under the Knight Ridder
Group Medical Benefit Plan for Employees and Retirees (Blue and Green
Option).

7.11 _COBRA Coverage_. Seller shall continue to provide continuation
coverage required by Section 4980B of the IRC and Sections 601 to 608 of

"qualifying events" (as defined in Section 4980B of the Code) which are
incurred on or prior to the Closing Date but are not in connection with the
transaction contemplated hereby. Buyer shall provide or cause to be provided
any COBRA coverage with respect to any Business Employees and their covered
beneficiaries who are entitled to COBRA coverage with respect to "qualifying
events" that are incurred (a) on or prior to the Closing Date and in
connection with the transaction contemplated hereby or (b) after the Closing
Date under any group health plan of Buyer or the Acquired Companies in which
Acquired Employees participate.

7.12 _Seller Retained Post-Retirement Benefit Liabilities_.

(a) Seller shall retain responsibility for providing, and shall continue to
provide, post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits on terms and
conditions substantially equivalent in duration, scope, value, participant
cost, vesting and otherwise to those in effect on the Closing Date (in no
event shall this prevent Seller from modifying the benefits so long as they
are substantially equivalent in the aggregate) with respect to:

(i) Business Employees (including Union Employees other than Union Employees
covered by a multiemployer welfare benefit plan in accordance with the
applicable collective bargaining agreement) who have retired on or prior to
the Closing Date and are receiving or entitled to receive post-retirement
medical and life insurance benefits, and



 

-44- (ii) Acquired Employees (including Union Employees other than Union Employees
covered by a multiemployer welfare benefit plan in accordance with the
applicable collective bargaining agreement) who have satisfied the eligibility
requirements for post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits as of the
Closing Date and subsequently become entitled to receive such benefits.

(b) Seller shall retain responsibility for, pay or otherwise discharge, and
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and the Acquired Companies against any
liability, claim or obligation (including reasonable attorneys fees) relating
to any obligation to provide post-retirement medical and life insurance
benefits to Business Employees and Acquired Employees identified above to the
extent eligibility for such benefits existed immediately prior to the Closing
Date (other than the requirement that any such individual actually retire).
Without limitation of such indemnity, Buyer acknowledges that Seller retains
certain discretion under the Merger Agreement as to the provision of such
benefits (for example, Seller may provide benefits at a level only
substantially equivalent in the aggregate to those benefits provided to Seller
retirees). 

7.13 _WARN Act_. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each to provide any
notice required under the WARN Act or similar local laws, and Buyer shall
provide Seller with all information required to issue such notices required
prior to the Closing.

7.14 _Cooperation_. Upon request, Seller shall provide Buyer, and Buyer shall
provide Seller, such documents, data and information as may reasonably be
necessary to implement the provisions of this Article 7 and to administer

for continuation of employment by Buyer or its affiliates, (b) requiring Buyer

fringe benefit plan, program or practice or any other employee benefit plan
of any nature whatsoever, except as expressly provided otherwise in this

Acquired Employee any rights or remedies under this Agreement (including under

costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal,
accounting and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, settling or satisfying any and all demands, claims,
actions or causes of action, suits, proceedings, deficiencies, assessments,
judgments or appeals, and in seeking indemnification therefor pursuant to this
Section 10.2) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") arising out of, resulting from,
related to or associated with (i) any and all of the Assumed Liabilities or
(ii) breach of the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in
Sections 5.2(a), 5.2(b), 5.4 or 5.6.

10.3 _Indemnification By Seller_. From and after the Closing, Seller shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its affiliates and their
respective stockholders, officers, directors, employees, affiliates, agents
and representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ "), from
and against all Losses arising out of, resulting from, related to
or associated with (i) any and all of the Excluded Liabilities or (ii) breach
of the representations and warranties of Seller contained in Sections 4.2(a),
4.2(b), 4.4 or 4.5.

10.4 _Notice and Defense of Claims_. Each party entitled to indemnification
under this Article 10 (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give notice to the
party required to provide such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claims as to
which indemnity is sought, and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume
the defense of any such claim or litigation resulting therefrom and to consent
to the entry of any judgment or the entry into of any settlement with respect
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate
in such defense at such partys expense; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article 10
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been adversely affected
by such failure. The Indemnified Party shall furnish such information
regarding itself or the claim in question as the Indemnifying Party
may reasonably request in writing and shall otherwise cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party to such extent as shall be reasonably required in
connection with the defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom.

10.5 _Procedure for Indemnification  Third Party Claims_.

(a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party under Section 10.2 or
Section 10.3 of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding against it, such
Indemnified Party will, if a claim is to be made against an Indemnifying
Party under such Section, give notice to the Indemnifying Party of the
commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the Indemnifying Party
will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to
any Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the Indemnified
Partys failure to give such notice.

(b) If any Proceeding referred to in Section 10.5(a) is brought against an
Indemnified Party and it gives notice to the Indemnifying Party of
the commencement of such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled
to participate in such Proceeding and, to the



 

-49-  extent that it wishes (unless (x) the Indemnifying Party is also a party to
such Proceeding and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint
representation would be inappropriate, or (y) the Indemnifying Party fails to
provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of its financial
capacity to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to
such Proceeding), to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and, after notice from the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such
Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party will not, as long as it diligently
conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Article
10 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the
defense of such proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, other
than reasonable costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Proceeding, (i) it will be conclusively established for purposes
of this Agreement that the claims made in that Proceeding are within the scope
of and subject to indemnification, regardless of the amount, (ii) no
compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the Indemnifying
Party without the Indemnified Partys consent unless the sole relief provided
is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, and (iii)
the Indemnified Party will have no liability with respect to any compromise
or settlement of such claims effected without its consent. If notice is given
to an Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any Proceeding and the
Indemnifying Party does not, within thirty (30) days after the
Indemnified Partys notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of
its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party
will be bound by any determination made in such Proceeding or any compromise
or settlement effected by the Indemnified Party of such Proceeding, in each
case, with the consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

10.6 _Procedure for Indemnification  Other Claims_. A claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party claim may be
asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought.

10.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to the applicability of Article 9 hereof,
except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of Law, including,
without limitation, claims under applicable state and federal securities laws
and except for covenants contained herein which by their terms are to be
performed at or after the Closing and Section 11.1, the indemnification
obligations under this Article 10 shall be the sole and the exclusive remedy
of the parties hereto with respect to any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement by any party hereto or
any certificate delivered in connection herewith, except that, subject to
Article 9 hereof, nothing herein or in any such certificate shall be construed
or interpreted as limiting or impairing the rights or remedies that the
parties hereto may have at equity for injunctive relief or specific
performance.

in which such party or any Subsidiary of such party does not have a majority
of the voting interests in such partnership).

(b) References in this Agreement (except as specifically otherwise defined) to
" _affiliates_ " shall mean, as to any person, any other person which,
directly or indirectly, controls, or is controlled by, or is under
common control with, such person. As used in this definition, " _control_ "
(including, with its correlative meanings, " _controlled by_ " and " _under
common control with_ ") shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of
the power to direct or cause the direction of management or policies of a
person, whether through the ownership of securities or partnership or other
ownership interests, by contract or otherwise.

(c) References in this Agreement (except as specifically otherwise defined) to
" _person_ " shall mean an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a
limited liability company, an association, a trust or any other entity, group
(as such term is used in Section 13 of the Exchange Act) or organization,
including a Governmental Entity, and any permitted successors and assigns
of such person.

(d) References in this Agreement to " _knowledge_ " shall mean (i) with
respect to Buyer, the knowledge of Lloyd Case and (ii) with respect to

-52- individuals listed on Section 11.3(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules and

only), P. Anthony Ridder, Steven Rossi, Hilary Schneider, Karen Stevenson,
Alice Wang and Gordon Yamate.

(e) References in this Agreement to " _business day_ " shall mean any day
other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which the banks in New York or
California are authorized by law or executive order to be closed.

(f) References in this Agreement to specific laws or to specific provisions
of laws shall include all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Any
statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument
referred to herein shall mean such statute as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including by succession of comparable successor
statutes.

11.4 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, Exhibit or Disclosure Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section
of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the word " _include_ ," "
_includes_ " or " _including_ " is used in this Agreement, it shall be deemed
to be followed by the words "without limitation."

11.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each party and
delivered to each other party.

11.6 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
other agreements referred to herein constitute the entire agreement (and
supersede each prior agreement and understanding, whether written or oral)
among the parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement. This
Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or remedies on any person other
than the parties hereto. The rights of Buyer Indemnified Parties and Seller
Indemnified Parties under Article 10 may be asserted by Buyer and Seller,
respectively.

11.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by; and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware regardless of any Laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

11.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any right, interest or
obligation hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of
law or otherwise, by any party without the prior written consent of the other
party; provided that (i) prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may elect to have
one or more of its Subsidiaries that, in each case, is either directly or
indirectly wholly-owned by Buyer acquire the Shares and the Acquired Assets
and assume the Assumed Liabilities, but in each case only if each such
Subsidiaries become parties to this Agreement and agree to be bound by the
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations herein and Buyer
guarantees such Subsidiaries obligations herein and provided that no such
election shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder and (ii) following
the Closing, Buyer may assign its rights and obligations



 

-53- hereunder to any transferee of that part of the Business to which such rights
relate, provided that such assignment shall not relieve Buyer of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence of this Section 11.8,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties and their respective legal successors
and permitted assigns.

11.9 _Nondisclosure_. Except as may be required by applicable Law or the
requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, for a period of three (3) years
following the Closing, Seller will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to) take
commercially reasonable steps comparable to those steps Seller takes with
regard to its own similar confidential information to protect the
confidentiality of all confidential information related to the Business in the
possession of Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than information which is or
becomes known to the public other than through a breach of this Section
by Seller).

11.10 _Amendments; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except by written agreement of the parties. No breach of any covenant,
agreement, representation or warranty made herein shall be deemed waived
unless expressly waived in writing by the party who might assert such breach.

11.11 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if
any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
terms or were otherwise breached. Each party shall be entitled to injunctive
relief to prevent any breach of this Agreement and to enforce this Agreement
specifically in any court of the State of Delaware or any court of the United
States located in the State of Delaware (in addition to any other remedy to
which such party is entitled at law or in equity). In addition, each party
hereby:

(a) submits itself to the personal jurisdiction of (i) the courts of the State
of Delaware; and (ii) the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware with respect to any dispute arising out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby to the extent such courts would have subject
matter jurisdiction with respect to such dispute;

(b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction or venue by motion or other request for leave from any such
court; and

(c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement (or
any transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in any court order than
such courts referred to above.

11.12 _Severability_. Each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted so
as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision is
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law in any
jurisdiction, then such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not
affect any other provision, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed
and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never been included herein.



 

-54- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date
first written above.
