\- vi -  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of the  _
_ day of May, 2013 by and among Brown and Brown, Inc., a Florida corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Brown and Brown Merger Co., a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ "),
Beecher Carlson Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "),
and BC Sellers Representative LLC, as the Sellers Representative.
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in the text hereof are defined in
Section 24 of this Agreement.

Preliminary Statement

 

Each of the Common Stockholders owns the number of the issued and outstanding
shares of the Class A Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share (the " _Class
A Common Stock_ "), and Class B Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share (the
" _Class B Common Stock_ "; collectively, the Class A Common Stock and the
Class B Common Stock are referred to as the " _Common Stock_ "), of the
Company set forth opposite his, her or its name under the caption "Total
Common Shares" in Section 2.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

Each of the Preferred Stockholders owns the number of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (the "
_Preferred Stock_ "), of the Company and in the series set forth opposite his,
her or its name under the caption "Total Preferred Shares" in Section 2.4(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

The Preferred Stock and Common Stock, together, represent all of the issued
and outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company.

 

The respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent, and Buyer have
determined that the transactions described herein are in the best interests
of such party and its respective stockholders. This Agreement provides for
the acquisition of the Company by Parent pursuant to the merger of Buyer with
and into the Company. At the effective time of such Merger, each outstanding
share of Common Stock and Preferred Stock, and each Option and Warrant shall,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be converted into the
right to receive a cash payment at Closing and contingent payments after
Closing.

 

The Companys Certificate of Incorporation provides that this Agreement and
the Merger must be approved by the affirmative vote of holders of (a) a
majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and voting Common Stock,
voting together as a single class, (b) a majority of the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock voting together as a single class, and (c) a majority of the
outstanding shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, voting together as a
single class (collectively, the " _Stockholders  Approvals_"). Immediately
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Written Consent will
be executed and delivered by the Investors and the Management Stockholders,
which Written Consent when executed and delivered will be sufficient to obtain
the Stockholders Approval.

 



\- 1 -  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the mutual
promises hereinafter set forth and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby
agree as follows:

1\. _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, Buyer shall be merged with and into the Company in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (the " _Merger_ "). The
Company shall be the Surviving Corporation resulting from the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of
the State of Delaware. The Merger shall be consummated pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, which has been approved and adopted by the respective
Boards of Directors of the Company, Buyer and Parent.

1.1. _Effective Time_. A certificate of merger shall be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date and the Merger
shall be deemed effective as of the time of the filing of the certificate of
merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Effective
Time_ ").

1.2. _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read in its
entirety as set forth on _Exhibit A_. 

1.3. _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated to conform to the bylaws of Buyer as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

1.4. _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Buyer in office immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall become the directors of the Surviving
Corporation and shall continue to hold such office from the Effective Time
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed in the manner
provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation or as otherwise provided by Applicable Law. The officers of the
Company in office immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue
as the corresponding officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall continue
to hold such offices from the Effective Time until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed in the manner provided by the Certificate of
Incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided
by Applicable Law.

1.5. _Conversion of Shares in Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Section 1, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part
of Buyer or the Company:

(a) Each share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time
(excluding Appraisal Shares and shares of Preferred Stock that were converted
into shares of Common Stock at or immediately before the Effective Time)
shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into and exchanged for
the right to receive from the Merger Consideration, the liquidation preference
that such shares series of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive pursuant
to the Companys Certificate of Incorporation (the " _Liquidation Preferences_
"), plus all accrued but unpaid dividends on such share of Preferred Stock as
provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation.

 



\- 2 -  (b) Each share of Series D Preferred Stock that is converted to Common Stock
at or immediately before the Effective Time shall _also_ be entitled to
receive from the Merger Consideration any accrued but unpaid dividends on such
share of Series D Preferred Stock as provided in the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation. If the Merger Consideration is insufficient to permit the
payment to the holders of Preferred Stock of the full amounts described in
Sections 1.5(a) and (b), then the entire Merger Consideration shall be
distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the holders of the
Preferred Stock in proportion to the full amounts they would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to Sections 1.5(a) and (b).

(c) To the extent any Merger Consideration remains after payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Liquidation Preferences and the accrued but
unpaid dividends pursuant to Sections 1.5(a) and (b) (the " _Remaining Merger
Consideration_ "), each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding at the
Effective Time (excluding Appraisal Shares, but including shares of Common
Stock issued upon conversion of any Preferred Stock) shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive
an amount equal to (i) the Per Share Price, without any interest thereon,
_plus_ (ii) subject to Section 9, the Per Share Indemnity Escrow
Consideration, if any, if and when released in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, _plus_ (iii) the Per Share Working Capital Excess, if any. To the
extent no Merger Consideration remains after payment of Merger Consideration
in respect of the liquidation preferences of all series of Preferred Stock
pursuant to Sections 1.5(a) and (b), each issued and outstanding share of
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

(d) To the extent of any Remaining Merger Consideration, each Option, whether
or not vested or exercisable, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into and
exchanged for the right to receive an amount equal to (i) the product of (X)
the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock of the Company that would be
issued to the holder of such Option if such Option were exercised in full
multiplied by (Y) the Per Share Price Per Option, without any interest
thereon, _plus_ (ii) subject to Section 9, the Per Share Indemnity Escrow
Consideration, if any, if and when released in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, _plus_ (iii) the Per Share Working Capital Excess, if any.

(e) To the extent of any Remaining Merger Consideration, each Warrant issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive
an amount equal to (i) the product of (X) the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock of the Company that would be issued to the holder of such
Warrant if such Warrant were exercised in full multiplied by (Y) the Per Share
Price Per Warrant, without any interest thereon, _plus_ (ii) subject to
Section 9, the Per Share Indemnity Escrow Consideration, if any, if and when
released in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, _plus_ (iii) the Per Share
Working Capital Excess, if any.

 



\- 3 -  (f) All shares of the capital stock of the Company which are held in the
treasury of the Company shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist without any conversion thereof, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

(g) Each share of capital stock of Buyer issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be
converted into and exchanged for one newly and validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and such
shares shall, collectively, represent all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(h) Buyer, the Company, or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable with respect to
the conversion of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 1.5 of this Agreement, Options pursuant to Section 1.5(d) of this
Agreement or Warrants pursuant to Section 1.5(e) of this Agreement at the
time such consideration is paid, such amounts as Buyer, the Company, or the
Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of state,
local, or foreign Tax law. Payments of the net consideration to be paid to
holders of the Options at Closing shall be made by Company checks through the
Companys payroll process. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be timely paid to the appropriate Taxing Authority and
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by any person who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL
(" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into Merger Consideration as
provided in this Section 1.5, but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall
be entitled to the payment of the fair market value of such Appraisal Shares
in accordance with Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to receive payment of the fair market value under Section 262, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair market value of such holders
Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in this
Section 1.5, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate
formerly representing such shares. The Company shall give prompt written
notice to Buyer of any written demands for appraisal of such Shares and shall
have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. The Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands in excess of the payment of the applicable
Liquidation Preference and accrued but unpaid dividends outlined in the
Companys Certificate of Incorporation, in the case of Preferred Stock, or the
Per Share Price, if any in the case of Common Stock, in respect of any
Appraisal Share, without the written consent of Buyer, except to the extent
that (i) the Companys cash is used prior to the Closing to effect such
payment or settlement, (ii) a full release is obtained from such holder and
(iii) no obligations with respect to the Appraisal Shares remain following the
Closing. As

 



\- 4 -   provided in Section 1.6(f)(i)(H), any payment by the Company prior to the
Effective Time with respect to Appraisal Shares shall be a Company Fee and
Expense. Compliance by the Company in delivering notice of any statutory
rights to dissent to holders of capital stock of the Company or in complying
with the applicable provisions of the DGCL related to appraisal rights shall
not serve as any waiver of the rights the Company has under Section 5 of the
Voting Agreement against any holder who dissents or exercises any rights of
appraisal in the Merger. If a payment is made by the Company prior to the
Effective Time with respect to Appraisal Shares, the Sellers Representative
and Parent shall adjust the Per Share Price to reflect the additional Company
Fees and Expenses and the reduced number of Shares Outstanding, if applicable,
arising from the payments so made.

 

1.6. _Exchange Procedures and Payments at Closing_.

(a) As a condition to payment of any amounts payable to a Stockholder
hereunder, (i) any such holder of shares of Common Stock issued and

after the receipt by the Company of the certificates representing all of such
holders shares of Common Stock and certificates formerly representing all of
such holders shares of Preferred Stock and a corresponding Letter of
Transmittal, by wire transfer or, at the option of the Company, if such
payment is less than $100,000 and not made at the Closing, by check as
described in such Letter of Transmittal.

(iv) Payments of the Per Share Price Per Option to the holders of the Options
pursuant to Section 1.5(d)(i) shall be made by Surviving Corporation on the

(f) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, Sections 5.1 and 5.2, from the date hereof through the Closing,

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Contemplated
Transactions_ ") by Sellers, the Company or the Sellers Representative (on
behalf of Sellers) (collectively, " _Company Fees and Expenses_ "), including,
without limitation, (A) legal and accounting fees and expenses, (B) the
advisory fees, expenses and any other payments owed to the Company Financial
Advisor pursuant to that certain letter agreement dated September 13, 2012, by
and between the Company and the Company Financial Advisor (the " _Advisory

or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any director, officer, employee or

to the Effective Time (the " _Pre-Closing Third Party Payments_ ") and (y) all
Company Fees and Expenses and all Indebtedness that remain unpaid after giving

"). At the Closing, Parent shall pay or shall cause to be paid in full the

shall not include payroll taxes payable by the Company or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to compensation attributable to the exercise of

this Agreement, each certificate theretofore representing shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock, each Option and each Warrant, shall from and after
the Effective Time be deemed to be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and shall represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
consideration set forth in Section 1.5.

 



\- 7 -  1.8. _Working Capital Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing Determination_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent (i) the estimated unaudited
balance sheet of the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date
but prior to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions (the "
_Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with (ii) a certificate of the
Company (the " _Company Pre-Closing Certificate_ ") executed on its behalf by
the Chief Financial Officer of the Company that sets forth in reasonable
detail the Companys good faith estimate of the Merger Consideration and the
Per Share Price (assuming conversion of all shares of Preferred Stock into
shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time) as well as its
estimates of the Working Capital Amount (the " _Estimated Working Capital_
"), Indebtedness (" _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), and Third Party Payables ("
_Estimated Third Party Payables_ ") as of the time immediately prior to the
Effective Time, such Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and other estimates
shall be prepared in accordance with the Sample Working Capital Calculation
and GAAP, using the policies, conventions, methodologies and procedures used
by the Company in preparing the Audited Financial Statements as of and for
the period ended December 31, 2012, subject to exceptions for customary year-
end adjustments and other modifications specifically identified in this
Agreement. The amount set forth as Estimated Working Capital, Estimated
Indebtedness, or Estimated Third Party Payables, as applicable, on the
Company Pre-Closing Certificate shall be deemed to be Estimated Working
Capital, Estimated Indebtedness and Estimated Third Party Payables, as
applicable, for all purposes under this Agreement,  _provided_ that prior to
the Companys delivery of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Company
Pre-Closing Certificate, Parent shall have a reasonable opportunity to review
and consult with the Company with respect to the Companys preparation of the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the above estimates set forth in the
Company Pre-Closing Certificate. A sample calculation of the Working Capital
Amount and the Closing Date Balance Sheet calculated as of June 30, 2013 is
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Sample Working Capital Calculation_ ").

(b)  _Post-Closing Determination_. Within ninety (90) calendar days after the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation will conduct a review (the " _Closing
Date Review_ ") of the Working Capital Amount as of the Closing Date
but prior to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and will
prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative a balance sheet (the "
_Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") and a computation of the Working Capital
Amount as of the time immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Closing
Date Working Capital Amount_ "). The Closing Date Working Capital Amount shall
be calculated in accordance with the Sample Working Capital Calculation and
GAAP, using the policies, conventions, methodologies used by the Company in
preparing the Audited Financial Statements, as of and for the period ended
December 31, 2012, subject to exceptions for customary year-end adjustments.
The Surviving Corporation will make available to the Sellers Representative
all records and work papers used in preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet.
If the Sellers Representative disagrees with the computation of the Closing
Date Working Capital Amount or the items reflected on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet, the Sellers Representative may, within thirty (30) calendar
days after receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, records

 



\- 8 -   and work papers, deliver a notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ") on behalf of
the Sellers to the Surviving Corporation setting forth the Sellers
Representatives calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital Amount. If
the Sellers Representative does not deliver an Objection Notice within such
thirty (30) calendar day period, then the Closing Date Working Capital Amount
shall be deemed to be finally determined. If the Sellers Representative
delivers an Objection Notice to the Surviving Corporation, the Sellers
Representative and the Surviving Corporation will use reasonable efforts to
resolve any disagreement as to the computation of the Closing Date Working
Capital Amount as soon as practicable, but if they cannot reach a final
resolution within forty-five (45) calendar days after the Surviving
Corporation has received the Objection Notice, the Surviving Corporation
and the Sellers Representative on behalf of the Sellers will jointly retain
a firm to be agreed upon in writing prior to Closing (the " _Firm_ ") to
resolve their disagreement. The Surviving Corporation and the
Sellers Representative will direct the Firm to render a determination within
sixty (60) calendar days of its retention and the Surviving Corporation and
the Sellers Representative and their respective agents will cooperate with
the Firm during its engagement. The Firm will consider only those items and
amounts in the Closing Date Balance Sheet set forth in the Objection Notice
which the Surviving Corporation and the Sellers Representative are unable to
resolve. In resolving any disputed item, the Firm may not assign a value to
any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party
or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The
Firms determination will be based on such review as the Firm deems necessary
to make its determination, and on the definition of the Closing Date Working
Capital Amount included herein. The determination of the Closing Date Working
Capital Amount by the Firm will be conclusive and binding upon the Surviving
Corporation, the Sellers Representative and the Sellers. The Surviving
Corporation and the Sellers shall bear the costs and expenses of the Firm
based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded
to each party bears to the amount actually contested by or on behalf of such
party, and the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) and the
Surviving Corporation shall each pay one-half of any retainer required by the
Firm at the initiation of the engagement, such amount to be reallocated and
credited or reimbursed by the other party depending on the final award of the
contested amount by the Firm. The Closing Date Working Capital Amount, as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.8(b), is referred to herein as
the " _Actual Closing Date Working Capital Amount_."

(c)  _Payment of Working Capital Adjustments_.

(i) _Payment by the Surviving Corporation_. If the Actual Closing
Date Working Capital Amount exceeds the Estimated Working Capital (the amount
of such excess being defined as the " _Working Capital Excess Adjustment_ "),
the Surviving Corporation shall, within five (5) business days after
the determination thereof, pay to the Sellers Representative, for subsequent
distribution in accordance with this Agreement, an amount equal to the Working
Capital Excess Adjustment, together with interest on such amount from the
Closing Date to and including the date of payment at an interest rate equal
to the interest such amount would have earned in the escrow through the Escrow
Agreement, if any, after taking into account any amounts paid pursuant to
Section 1.8(c)(iii). Such payment shall be made by wire transfer or delivery
of other immediately available funds in United States Dollars to the Sellers
Representative in cash, by cashiers or certified check, or by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Sellers
Representative.

 



\- 9 -  (ii) _Payment by Sellers_. If the Actual Closing Date Working Capital Amount
is less than the Estimated Working Capital (the amount of such deficit being
the " _Working Capital Deficit Adjustment_ "), the Surviving Corporation and
the Sellers Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to
the Surviving Corporation, from the Escrowed Amount, an aggregate amount
equal to the Working Capital Deficit Adjustment, together with interest earned
in the escrow thereon, if any, as provided in the Escrow Agreement, after
taking into account any amounts paid pursuant to Section 1.8(c)(iii). Such
payment will be made in cash, by cashiers or certified check, or by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(iii) _Payment Pending Resolution of Dispute_. If, pursuant to Section 1.8(a)
above, a dispute exists as to the final determination of the Actual Closing
Date Working Capital Amount, the Surviving Corporation and Sellers shall
promptly pay to the other, as appropriate in accordance with Sections
1.8(c)(i) and 1.8(c)(ii), such amounts as are not in dispute, pending final
determination of such dispute pursuant to Section 1.8(b).

1.9. _Sellers  Representative_.

 

(a) In order to efficiently administer (i) the determination of the Merger
Consideration and the Actual Closing Date Working Capital Amount, (ii) the
distribution of any amounts payable or distributable to Sellers, (iii) the
waiver of any condition to the obligations of the Company to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions, and (iv) the defense and/or settlement of any

hereby designate BC Sellers Representative LLC as their representative (the

be given under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (v) to take any and
all additional action as is contemplated to be taken by or on behalf of

taken by or on behalf of Sellers in connection herewith, (vii) to withhold
funds to pay Seller-related expenses and obligations, (viii) to withhold

 



\- 10 -   additional funds as determined by the Sellers Representative in its
discretion to pay future or contingent Seller expenses and obligations and
(ix) to seek recourse against any Seller for the benefit of the other Sellers
in the event of a disbursement to the Buyer Indemnified Parties due to any
breach of the representations and warranties made by such Seller in a Seller
Delivery.

 

(c) In the event that the Sellers Representative is dissolved, becomes unable
to perform its responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position,
Sellers holding, prior to the Closing, a majority of the voting Common Stock
and Preferred Stock as set forth in Section 2.4(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall select another representative to fill such vacancy and such
substituted representative shall be deemed to be the Sellers Representative
for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(d) All decisions and actions by the Sellers Representative, including,
without limitation, any agreement between the Sellers Representative and the
Surviving Corporation relating to the determination of the Actual Closing Date
Working Capital Amount or the defense or settlement of any Proceedings with
respect to which any Buyer Indemnified Party may be entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to Section 9 hereof, shall be binding upon all of the
Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same.

 

(e) By approving this Agreement, or by executing a Letter of Transmittal, an
Option Cancellation and Payment Acknowledgement or a Warrant Cancellation and
Payment Acknowledgement, Sellers agree that:

(i) Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and each other Buyer Indemnified
Party shall be able to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions of
the Sellers Representative as to the determination of the Actual Closing Date
Working Capital Amount or the settlement of any claims for indemnification by
any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9 hereof or any other actions
required to be taken by the Sellers Representative hereunder, and no Seller
or party hereunder shall have any cause of action against Parent, Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Buyer Indemnified Party for any action
taken by any such Person in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the
Sellers Representative;

 

(ii) all actions, decisions and instructions of the Sellers Representative
shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the Sellers and no Seller shall
have any cause of action against the Sellers Representative for any action
taken, decision made or instruction given by the Sellers Representative under
this Agreement, except for fraud or willful breach of this Agreement by the
Sellers Representative;

(iii) the provisions of this Section 1.9 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Seller may have in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions;

 



\- 11 -  (iv) the provisions of this Section 1.9 shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives and successors of each Seller, and any
references in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement to a Seller or Sellers
shall mean and include the successors to Sellers rights hereunder, whether
pursuant to testamentary disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or
otherwise;

(v) the Company Fees and Expenses shall include the sum of $500,000 to be
paid to the Sellers Representative and to be used by the Sellers
Representative for the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the
Sellers Representative in connection with the exercise by it of the
authority granted to it herein (including reasonable attorney fees and
expenses and the fees and expenses of any accountants or other professional
advisors retained by the Sellers Representative). From time to time after the
Effective Time, Sellers Representative may distribute to Sellers, pro rata
in accordance with their respective ownership of all shares of Preferred Stock
that are not converted at the Effective Time, plus the Fully Diluted Shares
Outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, such portion of such sum
as the Sellers Representative reasonably determines will not be needed for
the payment of future costs and expenses. Any portion of such sum remaining
after the final resolution of all claims asserted against, or asserted by or
on behalf of, Sellers hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement and the final
distribution to Sellers of all monies that are or could be distributable to
them hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement shall be distributed to Sellers
in their respective percentages based upon all shares of Preferred Stock that
are not converted at the Effective Time, plus the Fully Diluted Shares
Outstanding; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Sellers Representative
incurs costs and expenses disproportionately due to a Sellers breach of

Representative for the additional costs and expenses disproportionately
incurred; and

(vi) they will indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers Representative,
severally and not jointly, from and against any and all damages which may at
any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Sellers
Representative in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, or
any related agreement or instrument or any action taken or omitted to be taken
by the Sellers Representative under or in connection herewith, unless such
damages resulted solely from the bad faith of the Sellers Representative.

(f) All fees and expenses incurred by the Sellers Representative in excess of
$500,000 shall be paid from any funds otherwise due to Sellers (including
from the Escrowed Amount, if any, after such amount is released to Sellers
Representative) in proportion to their ownership of all shares of Preferred
Stock that are not converted at the Effective Time, plus the Fully Diluted
Shares Outstanding as set forth in Section 2.4(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule attached hereto and if no funds are available from the Escrowed
Amount, then directly from Sellers pro rata in accordance with their
respective ownership of all Shares of Preferred Stock that are not converted
at the Effective Time, plus the Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

Date, subject to such conditions being satisfied on the Closing Date), or at
such other place, time or date as may be mutually agreed upon in writing by
the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be deemed to have
occurred at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date (i.e., the Closing
Date belongs to the Buyer).

1.11. _Further Assurances_. Following the Effective Time, the parties shall,
and shall cause each of their Affiliates to, from time to time, execute and
deliver such additional instruments, documents, conveyances or assurances and
take such other actions as shall be necessary, or otherwise
reasonably requested, to confirm and assure the rights and obligations
provided for in this Agreement and render effective the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions, or otherwise to carry out the intent and purposes
of this Agreement.

 

1.12. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificates
evidencing shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock or evidencing Warrants
or Options shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the holder thereof shall
be paid the merger consideration with respect to such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates only upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the holder thereof in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent; provided,
however, that Parent may, in its sole discretion, require the delivery of a
satisfactory indemnity, which indemnity shall require the posting of a bond or
other collateral, unless Parent determines that such bond or other collateral
is not necessary.

1.13. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, and other similar transaction taxes and fees (including any

forth in the Company disclosure schedule attached hereto (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ "). The Company Disclosure Schedule will be arranged in
paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in
this Section 2; provided, however, that disclosure of any item in the Company
Disclosure Schedule with respect to one paragraph of Section 2 shall be deemed
disclosure both to the referenced paragraph and to every other paragraph of
Section 2 as to which the relevance of such item to such other paragraph of
Section 2

 



\- 13 -   is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure (it being understood
that to be so apparent it is not required that such other paragraph is cross-
referenced; provided, however, that the Company represents and warrants that
it has made all reasonable efforts to specifically cross reference in the
Company Disclosure Schedule all sections where a particular disclosure

(the " _Employee Benefit Plans_ "). Except as set forth in Section 2.12(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, each of the Employee Benefit Plans complies
with and has been administered in all material respects with ERISA, the Code,
and all other Applicable Laws, agreements and instruments by which it is
governed. All Employee Benefit Plans that are intended to be subject to Code
Section 401(a) and any trust agreement that is intended to be tax exempt have
been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be qualified under Code
Section 401(a) and exempt from taxation or the remedial amendment period for
receiving such favorable determination from the Internal Revenue Service has
not yet passed or is maintained under a prototype or volume submitter plan
and may rely upon a favorable opinion or advisory letter issued by the
Internal Revenue Service with respect to such prototype or volume submitter
plan. No event has occurred that would reasonably be expected to cause such
favorable determination to be revoked or any such Employee Benefit Plan or its
underlying trust to fail to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code. Except
for routine claims for benefits, no litigation, claims or disputes are
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a
Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no proceedings, audits or

proceeding or investigation threatened. Neither the Company nor its ERISA

Employee Benefit Plan providing welfare benefits (as defined in ERISA Section
3(1)) to employees after retirement or other separation of service except to

2.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and except for acceleration of

Benefit Plan, or (iii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase

in Section 4975 of the Code and Section 3(14) of ERISA, respectively, has
engaged in any material non-exempt "prohibited transaction," as defined in
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plan, nor have there been any fiduciary violations under ERISA by any
employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, which could, to the
Knowledge of the Company, subject the Company or any such Subsidiary (or any
officer, director or employee thereof) to any material penalty or tax under
Section 502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4971 and 4975 of the Code. Seller has

Company or its Subsidiaries to perform its captive management services.

suffered or incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties, or any of them, in

9.2. _Of the Seller Indemnities_. Sellers and each of their officers,
directors, members, stockholders, partners, Affiliates, assigns and
Representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be
indemnified, defended and held harmless (including by reimbursement for
Losses) by Parent and Buyer (including the Surviving Corporation,
as successor to Buyer after the Effective Time), as and to the extent
provided for herein, in an amount, in the aggregate, up to the Aggregate Cap
(except as set forth herein), for all Losses suffered or incurred by the
Seller Indemnified Parties, or any of them, in connection with, based upon,
arising from, or relating to, each and all of the following:

(a) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty made by
Parent or Buyer in Section 3 of this Agreement; and

 

(b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation contained in this
Agreement required to be performed by (i) Parent or Buyer prior to, at or
after the Closing, or (ii) by the Surviving Corporation after the Closing.

9.3. _Claims for Indemnification_. Whenever any claim shall arise for
indemnification under this Section 9, the party entitled to indemnification
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party obligated to
provide indemnification under this Section 9 (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
of the claim and, when known, the facts constituting the basis for such claim,
but the failure to provide such notice shall not affect the Indemnified
Partys right to indemnification hereunder except, and then only to the
extent, the Indemnifying Party was actually and materially prejudiced by such
failure to give notice. In the event of any such claim for indemnification
hereunder resulting from or in connection with any Proceeding by a third
party, the notice shall specify the amount or an estimate of the amount of the
liability arising therefrom, if known.

 



\- 50 -  9.4. _Third-Party Claims_. In connection with any claim which may give rise
to indemnity hereunder resulting from or arising out of any Proceedings by a
Person other than the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnifying Party may, upon
written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of
notice under Section 9.3(a), assume the defense of any such Proceeding (at the
sole expense of the Indemnifying Party) if and only if (a) the Indemnifying
Party acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any
Losses resulting from such Proceeding, (b) the Proceeding does not seek to
impose any liability on the Indemnified Party other than for monetary damages
and (c) where a Buyer Indemnified Party is the Indemnified Party, the
Proceeding does not relate to a Buyer Indemnified Partys relationship with
its customers or employees. If the Indemnifying Party is entitled to assume,
and assumes, the defense of any such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party
shall select counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to
conduct the defense of such Proceedings and shall take all steps reasonably
necessary in the defense or settlement thereof. The Indemnifying Party shall
not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from,
any such claim or Proceeding, the defense of which has been assumed by the
Indemnifying Party, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control)
the defense of any such Proceeding, with its own counsel and at its own
expense. If the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume, or does
not assume within thirty (30) days after the date such claim is made, the
defense of any such claim or Proceeding: (i) the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to defend against such claim or Proceeding and shall have the right
to undertake all steps in the defense or settlement thereof; provided that
the Indemnified Parties shall not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of
any judgment arising from, any such claim or Proceeding, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of
such action, with its counsel and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying
Party thereafter seeks to question the manner in which the Indemnified Party
defended such third party claim or the amount or nature of any such
settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden to prove by a
preponderance of the evidence that the Indemnified Party did not defend or
settle such third party claim in a reasonably prudent manner.

9.5.  _Survival of Representations; Claims for Indemnification_. All
representations and warranties made by the Company in Section 2 hereof, and
all representations and warranties made by Parent and Buyer in Section 3
hereof, shall survive the Closing and any investigation at any time made by
or on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties until 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time
eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date, unless prior to such time a
claim is asserted in writing and identified as a claim for indemnification
based upon the good faith belief of the party making such claim that a bona
fide breach of any of such representations and warranties has occurred;
provided, however, that (a) the representations and warranties made by the
Company in Section 2.16 hereof shall survive the Closing and any investigation
at any time made by or on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties until 5:00
p.m. Eastern Time two (2) years following the Closing Date, (b) all
representations and warranties made by the Company in Section 2 hereof and all
representation and warranties made by Parent and Buyer in Section 3 hereof
that, in either case, are included in the definition of "Special Matter"
shall survive the Closing and any investigation at any time made by or on
behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties until 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on
December 15, 2015, unless prior to such times a claim is

 



\- 51 -   asserted in writing and identified as a claim for indemnification based upon
the good faith belief of the party making such claim that a bona fide breach
of any of such representations and warranties has occurred. All covenants and
agreements herein that by their terms extend past the Closing shall survive
the Closing without limitation as to time; provided, however, that except for
the indemnification obligations set forth in Sections 9.1(a) and 9.2(a)
related to breaches of representations and warranties which survive for the
limited periods described above, the other indemnification obligations set
forth in Sections 9.1, 10.4 and 10.5 shall only survive the Closing and any
investigation at any time made by the Buyer Indemnified Parties until 5:00
p.m. Eastern Time on December 15, 2015.

 

9.6. _Limits_.

(a) None of the Buyer Indemnified Parties nor the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to indemnification with respect to Losses under Section 9.1
until the aggregate amount of all Losses under such Sections equals or
exceeds $500,000.00 (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), at which time such
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for all Losses in
excess of the Threshold Amount.

 

(b) The maximum aggregate amount that either the Buyer Indemnified Parties or
the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive as indemnity for
all Losses under Section 9.1 or Section 9.2, respectively, shall not exceed
the Escrowed Amount remaining in escrow at the time a claim is properly made
(the " _Aggregate Cap_ "). Any liability under Section 9.1 shall be satisfied
to the extent of the Aggregate Cap exclusively out of the Escrowed Amount as
provided in the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Aggregate
Cap shall not limit the obligation of the Buyer to pay the Merger
Consideration at the Closing.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Buyer Indemnified Parties nor
the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be subject to the limits set forth in
(a) above with respect to any Losses incurred by either of the Indemnified
Parties with respect to or as a result of any Special Matter or, in regards to
the Buyer Indemnified Parties, with respect to reimbursement of Aged Net
Receivables, Transition Costs or Mississippi Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities.

(d) With respect to any representation or warranty that contains a materiality
qualifier (including "material" and "in all material respects"), such
materiality qualifier shall be deemed to have been satisfied and a breach of
such representation or warranty shall be deemed to have occurred if the
aggregate Losses arising from such breach or series of related breaches equals
or exceeds $100,000. Solely for purposes of determining the amount of Losses
actually incurred by a Buyer Indemnified Party, the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 2 shall be read without giving effect to any
materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect, or similar materiality
qualification set forth therein.

9.7. _Losses_. Except in respect of a third party claim, in no event
shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement for any Losses in the nature of punitive, incidental or
consequential damages. Each of the Indemnified Parties and the

 



\- 52 -   other parties to this Agreement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue all legal rights and remedies available in order to minimize the Losses
for which indemnification is provided to it under this Section 9\.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no Buyer
Indemnified Party, including the Surviving Corporation as successor in
interest to Buyer, shall be entitled to recover under this Section 9
for Losses for any item (a) that is specifically included in the calculation
of the Merger Consideration Deductions and taken into account to reduce the
amount of the Merger Consideration, solely to the extent of such reduction, or
(b) to the extent such item specifically caused the payment of a working
capital adjustment pursuant to Section 1.8 hereof, solely to the extent of
such adjustment. The preceding sentence is intended only to avoid a Buyer
Indemnified Party receiving duplicate payments for a Loss.

9.8. _Insurance Proceeds and Third Party Payments._

 

The amount of Losses recoverable by any Indemnified Party under this Section 9
with respect to an indemnity claim shall be reduced by any amount actually
paid to such Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate thereof), with respect to the
Losses to which such indemnity claim relates, from an insurance carrier or a
third party, including any amount actually paid from any third party from
which the Company has contractual indemnification rights. Each of the
Indemnified Parties shall use reasonable commercial efforts to pursue, and to
cause its Affiliates to pursue, all insurance claims and claims against third
parties to which it may be entitled in connection with any Losses incurred,
and the Sellers Representative and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate
with each other and with such other Indemnified Parties in pursuing such
claims with respect to any Losses or any indemnification obligations with
respect to Losses. If any Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate thereof) receives
any insurance or third party payment in connection with any claim for Losses
for which it has already received an indemnification payment pursuant to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, it shall pay to the Indemnifying Party,
within thirty (30) days of receiving such insurance or third party payment, an
amount equal to the excess of (A) the amount previously received by such
Indemnified Party under this Section 9 with respect to such claim plus the
amount of the insurance or third party payments received, over (B) the amount
of Losses with respect to such claim which such Indemnified Party has
become entitled to receive under this Section 9\.

9.9. _Exclusive Remedy_. (a) The indemnification provisions set forth in this
Section 9 will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties to this
Agreement with respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement and (b) recourse by the disbursement of funds through the
Escrow Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties with respect to claims covered by this Section 9\.

9.10. _Errors and Omissions and Employment Practices Liability Extended
Reporting ("Tail") Coverage_.

(a) On or before the Closing Date, the Company will arrange to purchase, at
the Companys expense (to be treated as Company Fees and Expenses hereunder),
extended reporting period ("tail") coverage extensions for each of the
Companys professional liability (EandO) insurance policy and employment
practices liability (EPL) insurance policy (each and collectively, the "
_Required Tail Coverage_ ").

 



\- 53 -   The Required Tail Coverage shall extend for a period of at least five (5)
years from the Effective Time, shall have the same limits and deductibles
currently in effect, and shall otherwise be in form reasonably acceptable to
Parent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the endorsement or
policy evidencing the Required Tail Coverage shall not contain an "other
insurance" or similar provision that purports to make the Required Tail
Coverage excess rather than primary and non-contributory coverage as to any
error or omission or EPL occurrence arising before later of the Closing Date
and the Effective Time (an " _Excess Coverage Provision_ "). If the Required
Tail Coverage is procured as an endorsement to the Companys existing EandO
insurance policy or EPL insurance policy, and the existing policy contains an
Excess Coverage Provision, the Required Tail Coverage endorsement shall amend
the existing policy to (i) remove the Excess Coverage Provision and (ii) state
expressly that the Required Tail Coverage shall be primary and non-
contributory as to any error or omission or EPL occurrence arising before the
Effective Time.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the parties intent that, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Section 9: (i) as between the Required Tail
Coverage and any coverage that might be available under Parents policies, the
Required Tail Coverage shall be primary and non-contributory; (ii) Parent may
seek indemnity from the Escrowed Amount for any deductibles or retentions
under the Required Tail Coverage (" _Required Tail Deductible_ ") to the
extent permitted under this Section 9\.

 

(c) After the Closing, with respect to any Action that names or otherwise
involves the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or their Affiliates
as to which defense and/or coverage may be available for the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or their Affiliates under the Required Tail
Coverage, Parent may, at its option and sole discretion, directly pay any
applicable Required Tail Deductible under the Required Tail Coverage to the
appropriate Carrier and seek indemnity for such Required Tail Deductible
pursuant to this Section 9\. Nothing in this Section 9.11 shall limit or
affect the parties indemnity rights and obligations under Section 9.1.

9.11. _Tax Treatment_. The parties agree (a) to treat all payments made under
this Section 9 as adjustments to the aggregate consideration paid hereunder,
(b) that appropriate adjustments shall be made in calculating the amount of
any Losses for which indemnification is sought under this Section 9 to take
account of any net Tax benefit that will actually be realized for the year of
the Loss by the Surviving Corporation related to the payment or incurrence of
any item giving rise to such Loss.

 

10\. _Post-Closing Agreements_.

10.1. _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall obtain a directors and officers liability insurance
policy (the cost of which shall be a Company Fee and Expense) with coverage
for post-Effective Time periods for the benefit of any Person who was an
officer, director or manager of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
or who served as a fiduciary of any Employee Benefit Plan maintained by the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (the " _Post-Closing D andO Policy_").

 



\- 54 -  10.2. _Release of Sellers, Directors and Officers_. In consideration of the
covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, effective at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
hereby releases Sellers and the directors, managers, and officers of the
Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company serving prior to Closing for any
and all actions taken or omitted to be taken by them in connection with the
conduct of the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company for
any and all periods prior to the Closing and agree not to assert any
Proceedings against any of them for any such actions, whether in their
capacities as officers, managers, directors or controlling parties of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company; provided, however, that nothing
herein shall be deemed to modify, impair or limit the rights of Buyer
Indemnified Parties against Sellers with respect to any claim arising under or
in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.

 

10.3. _Employee Matters_. Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to
continue the employment of those employees of the Company and the
Subsidiaries of the Company agreed upon in writing between the Company and
Buyer who are employed on the date prior to the Closing Date (the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") at the same wage and salary levels as in effect
thereon. Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to the
Continuing Employees employee benefits, including medical, dental, disability,
severance, and 401(k) plan benefits as it shall determine in its sole
discretion. Subject to the provisions of any written employment agreement,
nothing contained in this Section will preclude Parent or the Surviving
Corporation at any time after the Closing Date from terminating in its
discretion the employment of any Continuing Employee, or from amending or
terminating any Employee Benefit Plan; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation shall bear all costs (including costs associated with severance
benefits, back pay, civil penalties, or benefits coverage under an Employee
Benefit Plan) incurred as a result of any such termination. This Agreement
shall not affect the "at will" employment of any employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries and does not constitute an agreement to employ any Person or
provide any level of wages, salary or benefits to any Persons for any
duration.

10.4. _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Returns_. The Sellers Representative shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file each Tax Return to be filed
by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date
which applies to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Sellers Representative shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent, no later than
thirty (30) days (or in the case of income Tax Returns, forty-five (45) days)
prior to the due date for filing (or such shorter period agreed to by the
Sellers Representative and Parent), such Tax Return in final form,
and Parent will have the right to review and comment on each such Tax Return
and will make such revisions to such Tax Return to the extent relating to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period as are reasonably requested by Parent, if received at
least five (5) days (or, in the case of income Tax Returns, twenty (20) days)
prior to the due date for filing (or such later date agreed to by the Sellers
Representative and Parent). If Parent does not deliver to the
Sellers Representative its dispute (described in the previous sentence)
within the permitted time periods (as described in the previous sentence),
then the relevant Tax Return shall be deemed to be finally determined and the
Sellers Representative shall be entitled to file such Tax

 



\- 55 -   Return. If Parent does deliver its dispute to the Sellers Representative
within the requisite time period, the Sellers Representative and Parent agree
to consult and to resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of the
review of such Tax Returns and to mutually consent to the filing of such Tax
Returns as promptly as possible. To the extent required by the terms of
Sections 9.1(e) and 10.4(c) of this Agreement, payable from the Escrowed
Amount remaining in escrow at the time a claim is properly made as described
in Section 9.6(b) of this Agreement, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to receive as indemnity any Taxes shown as due by the Company and
its Subsidiaries on the Tax Returns described in this Section 10.4(a) (and
excluding such Taxes included as a liability in the calculation of the Working
Capital Amount and net operating losses deductible against the income
giving rise to any Pre-Closing Taxes). No Buyer Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to any indemnification under Sections 9.1(e) and 10.4(c) of this
Agreement with respect to any Tax Claim arising in connection with any
amendment of any Tax Return of the Company or any Subsidiary for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period, or the making of any Tax election
that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case absent
the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative with respect to such
amendment or election and as otherwise in accord with Sections 10.4 and 10.5
herein.

(b)  _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

(i) All Tax Returns referred to in (a) will be prepared in a manner consistent
with the prior practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law.

(ii) Parent will prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for periods commencing after the Closing Date and
will be responsible for paying any Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns
(subject to the indemnification provisions hereunder).

(c) _Tax Indemnification_. Without duplication and subject to Section 9 as it
applies to Tax matters, in addition to claims for indemnification by the
Buyer Indemnified Parties under Section 9 of this Agreement relating to Tax
matters, the Buyer Indemnified Parties will be indemnified and held harmless,
against all Losses reasonably incurred, suffered or sustained by them,
directly or indirectly, arising out of, as a result of, or with respect to or
in connection with:

(i) all Losses attributable to (A) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or before
the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any
taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (" _Pre-
Closing Tax Period_ "), (B) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member
on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502- 6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or foreign law or
regulation, and (C) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than the Company
and its Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
transferee or successor, by contract (other than any contract the only parties
of which are the Company and its Subsidiaries) or pursuant to any law, rule,
or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before
the Closing; and

 



\- 56 -  (ii) in the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), (A) the amount of any Taxes based on
or measured by income or receipts of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period of any entity classified for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity in which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at
such time); provided, however, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis (such as the deductions for depreciation and
real estate taxes) will be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period in a
manner consistent with the methodology described in clause (A) hereof, (B) the
amount of Delaware franchise taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined using the proration method that is applicable in Delaware upon the
amendment to the Companys Certificate of Incorporation changing the Companys
authorized number of shares of capital stock, and (C) the amount of other
Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that relates
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period. If any
party (the " _Paying Party_ ") pays or has paid a Tax for which the other
party (the " _Non-Paying Party_ ") is responsible pursuant to the
apportionment set forth in this Section 10.4, the Paying Party shall be
entitled to reimbursement from the Non-Paying Party, unless such payment was
taken into account in the calculation of the Working Capital Amount.

 

(d) _Satisfaction of Claims_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (A) this Section 10.4 and Section 10.5 shall govern the procedures
for all contests, defenses and indemnification obligations related to or
attributable to Tax Claims, and (B) Sections 9, 10.4 and 10.5 shall govern the
procedures for all contests, defenses and indemnification obligations for
Claims relating to Tax Matters that are not Tax Claims.

(e) _Section 338 Election_. No election under Section 338(g) of the Code, or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, may be made with respect
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions without the Seller Representatives written consent (on behalf
of Sellers).

(f) _Transaction Tax Benefits_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the parties agree that the expenses and other costs incurred
by the Company in connection with the Contemplated Transactions shall be
reported on applicable income Tax Returns as income Tax deductions of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period and shall not be treated or reported as income Tax
deductions for a Post-Closing Tax Period (including under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or any comparable or similar
provision under state or local Applicable Law) unless otherwise required by
Applicable Law. Unless otherwise requested by

 



\- 57 -   the Sellers Representative, Parent shall cause the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, to make an election under IRS Revenue Procedure
2011-29 to treat seventy percent (70%) of any success-based fees that were
paid by or on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Corporation as an amount
that did not facilitate the Merger and therefore as deductible in a Pre-
Closing Tax Period for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law.

(g) _Conflicts_. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of
Section 9, on the one hand, and Sections 10.4 and 10.5, on the other hand, the
provisions of Sections 10.4 and 10.5 shall govern.

10.5. _Cooperation on Tax Matters; Tax Claims_.

(a) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Each of Parent and the Sellers
Representative will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by the other Party, in connection with the filing of all Tax Returns and any
audit, litigation or other claim with respect to Taxes (including the
provision of appropriate powers of attorney). Such cooperation will include
the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records
and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, Tax Return,
litigation or other claim and using commercially reasonable efforts to make
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Parent agrees
to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before
the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the
relevant taxable periods (and any extensions thereof), and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Body.

 

(b) _Amendment and Filing of Certain Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except as may be required by
Applicable Law, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) may amend any Tax Return with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (including a Straddle Period) without the prior written consent of the
Sellers Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(c) _Notice of Tax Claims_. If Parent or any of its Affiliates receives any
notice of a pending or threatened Tax audit, assessment, or adjustment
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries which may give rise to an
indemnification obligation of the Sellers hereunder (a " _Tax Claim_ "),
Parent will notify the Sellers Representative within ten (10) Business Days
of the receipt of such notice. The failure to so notify the Sellers
Representative shall not relieve the Sellers Representative of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have adversely
prejudiced the Sellers Representative or to the extent the survival periods
stated herein have lapsed.

 



\- 58 -  (i) With respect to any Tax Claim that relates to one or more taxable periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers Representative shall
have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice of a Tax Claim to assume
the conduct and control, through counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent and
at the expense of the Sellers Representative, of the settlement or defense
thereof (to the extent relating to the taxable periods ending on or prior to
the Closing Date), and Parent shall cooperate with the Sellers Representative
in connection therewith; provided that the Sellers Representative shall
permit Parent to participate in (in the manner described in clause (iii)
below), but not control, such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by
Parent (the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by Parent) and
further provided that the Sellers Representative shall not pay or settle such
Tax Claim (or portion thereof) without the prior written consent of Parent,
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If (A) the Sellers
Representative does not notify Parent within thirty (30) days after the
receipt of the Sellers Representatives notice of such Tax Claim hereunder
that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, or (B) the Sellers
Representative elects in writing not to conduct the defense and settlement of
such Tax Claim, Parent shall have the right to contest and defend the claim
but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to
Section 10.4(c). In such case, the Sellers Representative will reimburse
Parent periodically (but not more than once each calendar quarter) for the
reasonable cost of any third-party expenses (if any) incurred to defend
against the portion of such Tax Claim relating to the taxable periods ending
on or prior to the Closing Date, which amounts shall be treated as Losses. If
the Sellers Representative does not conduct the defense and settlement of a
Tax Claim, Parent shall not pay or settle such Tax Claim without the consent
of the Sellers Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

(ii) With respect to any Tax Claim that relates to a Straddle Period, Parent
and the Sellers Representative shall jointly control the resolution and
defense thereof and shall keep each other informed on a regular basis
regarding the status of any such Tax Claim. Parent and the Sellers
Representative will separately be responsible for their own fees and expenses
incurred in the settlement and defense of such Tax Claim. Neither Parent nor
the Sellers Representative shall pay or settle any such Tax Claim without the
prior written consent of the other party, with such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Additionally, clause (i) above
shall apply to the Pre-Closing Tax Period portion of the Straddle Period.

(iii) For purposes of clause (i) above, if Parent or the Sellers
Representative elects to participate in the settlement or defense of a Tax
Claim pursuant to clause (i), such party will have the right to (A)
participate in the defense of the Tax Claim with counsel selected by it (at
its own cost), (B) be kept reasonably informed on a timely basis of all
material communications relating to the Tax Claim (other than
privileged communications), including e-mails and filings, (C) be consulted
on all material decisions relating to the defense of the Tax Claim, including
suggesting strategic approaches to the defense, which suggestions the
controlling party shall consider in good faith, (D) participate in meetings
with Governmental Bodies with respect to the Tax Claim, and (E) review and
comment on drafts of material submissions (including settlement proposals) to
Governmental Bodies (with such drafts and comments being provided on a timely
basis).

 



\- 59 -  10.6. _Covenant Regarding Post-Closing Payments_. Parent and the Surviving
Company shall honor and pay all post-closing payment obligations listed on
Schedule 10.6, in accordance with their terms.

 

10.7. _Covenant Regarding Aged Net Receivables_. With respect to all Aged Net
Receivables, the Parent covenants and agrees to do the following:

(a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to collect all accounts receivable and premiums receivable, and to
pay all premiums payable, in a manner consistent with the policies and
practices used by the Company prior to Closing in the collection of its own
accounts and premiums receivable and premiums payable, a brief description of
which policies and practices has been provided to the Sellers Representative
prior to the date hereof;

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cancel any premium payable associated with a premium receivable
determined to be uncollectible after ninety (90) days;

(c) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall offset any negative account or premium
receivable against a positive account or premium receivable associated with
the same client in determining the Aged Net Receivables. Examples of the
mechanics for offsetting the receivables and payables is attached hereto as
Schedule 10.7(c); and

 

(d) During the period from the Closing Date until six (6) months following the
Closing Date, Parent shall forward to the Sellers Representative on a
monthly basis a detailed report identifying the status of the Aged Net
Receivables and such other information reasonably requested by the Sellers
Representative related to the Aged Net Receivables, including a final
detailed report as of the date that is six (6) months from the Closing Date
identifying all Aged Net Receivables collected during such six (6) month
period and all Aged Net Receivables that remain outstanding after such
six (6) month period no later than five business days after the end of such
six (6) month period (the " _Final Aged Net Receivables Report_ ").

10.8 _Transition Costs Agreement_. Company and Parent have agreed upon certain
transition costs as set forth on Schedule 10.8, which identifies the names of
certain Company employees and the length of time they will remain as
employees of the Surviving Corporation after the Closing. Additional
transition costs will not be deemed to be Transition Costs unless they are
consented to by Sellers Representative. Sellers Representative will not
unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent for up to a maximum of
three months total transition time for any individual set forth on Schedule
10.8 based on the representations of Dan Donovan and Steve Denton.

 



\- 60 -  11\. _Termination of Agreement_.

 

11.1. _Termination by Lapse of Time_.

(a) This Agreement may be terminated and the Contemplated Transactions
abandoned by Parent if the Closing does not occur on or before 5:00 p.m.,
Eastern Time, on October 1, 2013 (the " _Termination Time_ "), unless the
failure of such occurrence is due to the failure of Parent or Buyer to perform
or observe their respective agreements as set forth in this Agreement required
to be performed or observed at or before the Closing.

(b) This Agreement may be terminated and the Contemplated Transactions
abandoned by the Company if the Closing does not occur on or before the
Termination Time unless the failure of such occurrence is due to the failure
of the Company to perform or observe their respective agreements as set forth
in this Agreement required to be performed or observed at or before the
Closing.

11.2. _Termination by Agreement of the Parties_. This Agreement may be
terminated and the Contemplated Transactions abandoned at any time prior to
the Closing by the mutual written agreement of the Company, Parent and the
Sellers Representative.

11.3. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, Parent and
Buyer may, to the extent legally allowed, extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the Company, waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the Company contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and waive compliance with
any of the agreements of the Company or the conditions to the obligations of
Parent and Buyer contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to
this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

11.4.  _Availability of Remedies at Law_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in this Section 11, this Agreement shall immediately
become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of
Parent, Buyer, or the Company to consummate the transactions provided for
herein; provided, however, that (a) no such termination shall relieve any
party hereto from liability for damages arising out of or with respect to the
breach of this Agreement by such party prior to such termination and (b) the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive
any termination of this Agreement.

12\. _Brokers_.

12.1. _For the Company_. The Company represents and warrants that, other than
Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. (the " _Company Financial Advisor_ ") pursuant to
the Advisory Agreement, no Person, firm or corporation has acted in the
capacity of broker or finder on its behalf to bring about the negotiation of
this Agreement. All fees, expenses and other compensation owed to the Company
Financial Advisor, or any such other broker or finder, shall be Company Fees
and Expenses and shall be paid pursuant to Section 1.6(f).

  



\- 61 -  12.2. _For Buyer_. Parent agrees to pay all fees, expenses and compensation
owed to any Person, firm or corporation who has acted in the capacity of
broker or finder on its behalf or on behalf of any Affiliate thereof (other
than the Company or the Surviving Corporation) to bring about the negotiation
of this Agreement. Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Sellers
against any claims or liabilities asserted against them by any Person acting
or claiming to act as a broker or finder on behalf of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates.

 

13\. _Notices_. Any notices or other communications required or permitted

16\. _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid, illegal

in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this
Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

17\. _Governing Law and Venue_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and

and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

 

21\. _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein (including, without
limitation, in Section 9 hereof), any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Applicable Law or equity, upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy shall not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that, whether prior to or following the
Closing Date, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to

preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions, and that, following consummation of the
