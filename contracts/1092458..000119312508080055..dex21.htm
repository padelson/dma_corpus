permitted by applicable Law, waiver of those conditions), at the offices of
Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 153 East 53rd Street, New York, NY 10022, unless

The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "

not be required to effect the Closing until the earlier of (a) a date during

Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of State_ "), executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and, as soon as practicable on or after
the Closing Date, shall make any and all other filings or recordings required

shall agree in writing and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the
time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

(b) The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable
Law, except that such bylaws shall be amended to reflect that the name of

Merger Sub:

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (such shares, collectively,
the " _Shares_ ")  



 

3  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
(i) Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.l(b), (ii) any
Dissenting Shares and (iii) any Shares as to which treatment in the Merger is
separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof after the date of this
Agreement, which Shares shall be treated in the manner so agreed),
together with the associated Rights, shall thereupon be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $22.00
in cash, without interest, subject to deduction for any required withholding
of Tax pursuant to Section 3.5 (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and shall be
automatically cancelled and cease to exist.

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation, and constitutes the only outstanding share of the capital stock
of Surviving Corporation.

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period
(excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or
other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change.

Section 3.2  _Treatment of Options, Other Equity-Based Awards and Performance

Stock Option_ ") to purchase or acquire Shares or other capital stock of the
Company or its Subsidiaries granted under any employee, director or
compensatory stock option, stock purchase or equity compensation
plan, arrangement or agreement of the Company (the " _Company Equity Plans_
"), whether vested or unvested (except for Company Stock Options as to which
treatment in the Merger is separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof
after the date of this Agreement, which Company Stock Options shall be
treated in the manner so agreed), that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Company
Stock Option as soon as practicable following the Effective Time an amount in
cash (without interest, subject to deduction for any required withholding of
Tax pursuant to Section 3.5) equal to the product of (i) the excess of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company
Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Company Stock
Option; provided that if the exercise price per Share of any such Company
Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such
Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment being made in
respect  



 

4  thereof. At the Effective Time, any right outstanding or existing
immediately prior to the Effective Time to purchase or acquire capital stock
of the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to any compensatory arrangement
(other than a Company Stock Option) shall be canceled and terminated without

former director, officer, employee, consultant or independent contractor of
the Company or its Subsidiaries shall have any right to acquire any capital
stock of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(b) (i) With respect to each Performance Unit Award disclosed on Section
4.11(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter and each other Performance Unit Award
(or substantially similar award) that is not required to be canceled pursuant
to clause (ii)(A), below (collectively, the " _Eligible Awards_ "), the
Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take such actions as may be
necessary or appropriate to either, as elected by Parent, (1) pay
out promptly after the Effective Time to each holder of an Eligible Award the
Target Amount (or other similar term) of such Eligible Award, as shown on
Section 4.11(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to Eligible
Awards disclosed thereon, and terminate each such holders right to receive
any amount in respect of the Eligible Awards in excess of such Target Amount
or (2) keep the Eligible Awards outstanding in accordance with their current
terms and conditions (subject to appropriate adjustment to the performance
goals applicable to such Eligible Awards to reflect the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the number of shares of stock
of the Surviving Corporation outstanding after the Effective Time); provided
that if this alternative (2) is elected by Parent, (X) holders of Eligible
Awards shall not vest in any right to receive payment in respect of such
Eligible Awards by virtue of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (Y) each holder of an Eligible Award who is
not party to a CIC Agreement (as defined below) shall be promptly paid an
amount equal to the Target Amount (or other similar term) of such Eligible
Award, as shown on Section 4.11(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter with
respect to Eligible Awards disclosed thereon, in the event such Holder is
terminated by the Company and its subsidiaries without "Cause" (as such term
is defined under the Companys 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan as in effect on
the date hereof) prior to the date such Eligible Award would have been paid in
the ordinary course and such Holder executes and does not revoke a standard
release of claims and (Z) the amount ultimately payable to any holder of an
Eligible Award who subsequently vests in the ordinary course in the right to
receive a payment in respect of such Eligible Award shall be the Target Amount
of such Eligible Award, as shown on Section 4.11(d) of the Company Disclosure
Letter with respect to Eligible Awards disclosed thereon or, if greater, the
amount payable pursuant to such Eligible Award based on the degree to which
the performance goals (as modified as set forth above) applicable to such
Eligible Award are achieved as of the date such holder becomes so vested.

(ii) In furtherance of Section 3.2(b)(i) above, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take such actions as may be reasonably requested by
Parent in good faith (which may include obtaining appropriate written consents
of holders of Performance Unit Awards or adjusting performance goals
applicable to any Performance Unit Award) to (A) cancel for no payment
Performance Unit Awards (or other substantially similar award) not disclosed
on Section 4.11(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent the
aggregate " _Target Amount_ " (or other similar term) of all such awards
exceeds $250,000, (B) limit the aggregate amount of the Target Amounts for all
Eligible Awards to an amount that does not exceed $6,467,408, (C) terminate,
in the event alternative (1), above, is elected by  



 

5  Parent, any right any holder of Eligible Award may have to receive an amount
in excess of the Target Amount of such Eligible Award, as shown on Section

alternative (2), above, is elected by Parent, any right a holder of an
Eligible Award may otherwise have to accelerated vesting of such Eligible
Award as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (E) otherwise
implement the provisions of Section 3.2(b). Section 3.2(b) shall not require
the Company to amend or modify any Change in Control Agreement by and between
the Company and any employee (a " _CIC Agreement_ ").

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions as
may be reasonably required to effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.2.

Section 3.3 _Treatment of Convertible Notes_. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Indentures and after the Effective Time, each
holder of the 2012 Notes and the 2025 Notes will have the opportunity to
convert such holders Convertible Notes into the right to receive an amount in
cash for each $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes held by such
holder) equal to: (a) with respect to the 2012 Notes, the product of $22.00
multiplied by (45.5114 plus the increase in the conversion rate as determined
based on the make whole table set forth in section 4.13(b) of the 2007
Indenture) and (b) with respect to the 2025 Notes, the product of $22.00
multiplied by (53.0504 plus the increase in the conversion rate as determined
based on the make whole table set forth in section 4.13(b) of the 2005
Indenture (in each case, subject to any deduction for any required withholding
of Tax pursuant to the terms of the Indentures) (collectively, the "
_Convertible Note Consideration_ "). The Surviving Corporation shall pay to
each holder that so converts the Convertible Note Consideration as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the
Indentures.

Section 3.4 _Exchange and Payment_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time and subject to the terms of the Indentures,
Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement with the Companys transfer agent to
act as agent for the stockholders and Convertible Note holders of the Company
in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive the Merger
Consideration and the Convertible Note Consideration to which stockholders
and Convertible Note holders, respectively, of the Company shall become
entitled pursuant to this Article III. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent cash in
an amount sufficient to make all payments pursuant to this Article III (such
cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due
pursuant to this Article III, except as provided in this Agreement. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Paying Agent, incurred by it in connection with the exchange of Shares for
the Merger Consideration, the surrender of Convertible Notes for the
Convertible Note Consideration and other amounts contemplated by this Article
III.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the second Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) an
outstanding certificate or outstanding  



 

6  certificates (" _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding Shares, (ii) uncertificated Shares represented
by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") which, in each case, were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto
pursuant to Section 3.1(a), (iii) an outstanding certificated Convertible
Note (" _Certificated Note_ ") or (iv) Convertible Note in global form ("
_Global Note_ "), (A) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in
customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates, Book-Entry Shares, Certificated Notes or
Global Notes held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or Certificated Notes to the Paying Agent or, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares or Global Notes, upon adherence to the procedures set forth
in the letter of transmittal) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.1(a)
or Certificated Notes or Global Notes for the Convertible Note Consideration
payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.3. Upon surrender of a
Certificate, Book-Entry Share, Certificated Note or Global Note to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require,
the holder of such Certificate, Book-Entry Share, Certificated Note or Global
Note shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share or the Convertible Note Consideration for each Certificated Note
or Global Note, as applicable, (in each case, subject to deduction for any
required withholding of Tax pursuant to Section 3.5), to be mailed within five
(5) Business Days following the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time or
(ii) the Paying Agents receipt of such Certificate, Book-Entry Share,
Certificated Note or Global Note, and such Certificate, Book-Entry Share,
Certificated Note or Global Note shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate, Book-Entry Share, Certificated Note or Global Note. In the event
that the Merger Consideration or Convertible Note Consideration is to be paid
to a Person other than the Person in whose name any Certificate or
Certificated Note is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate or Certificated Note so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer, that the signatures on such
Certificate or any related stock power or Certificated Note shall be properly
guaranteed and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Certificated Note or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or
are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.4,
each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender or
transfer the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Shares
theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, pursuant to Section 3.1(a), without any interest thereon.

(c) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares,
together with the associated Rights, formerly represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such  



 

7  Shares formerly represented thereby, except as otherwise provided for herein
or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or
transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III,
subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

(d) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis; provided that any investment of such
cash shall in all events be in short-term obligations of the United States of
America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the
United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation.

(e) At any time following the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, Book-Entry Shares,
Certificated Notes or Global Notes, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to the Merger Consideration, without any interest, payable upon
due surrender of their Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or to the Surviving
Corporation as the successor to the Company with respect to the rights of the
Convertible Notes pursuant to the Indentures.

(f) If any Certificate or Certificated Note shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate or
Certificated Note to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent
or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as
Parent or the Paying Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate or Certificated Note, the Paying
Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
or Certificated Note the Merger Consideration payable or Convertible Note
Consideration payable, as applicable, in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 3.4 shall
be deemed to modify the Company or the Surviving Corporations rights and
obligations under the Indentures and in the event that there is any conflict
between the terms of this Agreement and the Indentures regarding the
Convertible Notes, the terms of the Indentures shall control.

Section 3.5 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, and the Paying Agent shall deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, Company Stock
Options or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as such Person is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld  



 

8  and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 3.6  _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger and who is entitled to demand and properly demands, exercises, and
perfects his or her demand for appraisal of such Shares pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to appraisal under the
DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL and shall be entitled to receive such consideration thereunder. If any
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to
appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into
and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably
lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 3.1(a). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of
any demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such
notices or demands and any other instruments received by the Company relating
to rights to appraisal or the right to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting
Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands.

agreed that disclosure of any information in a particular section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to any other section or subsection of this Agreement to which the
relevance of such information is reasonably apparent on its face), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

Section 4.1  _Organization, Standing and Power_

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) is an entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that

organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is
in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept)
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for any such failures to have such power and authority or to
be so qualified or licensed or in good standing as would not, individually or
in  



 

9  the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means any event,
change, circumstance, effect or state of facts that is, materially adverse to
(A) the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) the ability of the Company
to perform, in all material respects, its obligations under this Agreement or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, _however_ , that
"Material Adverse Effect" shall not include the effect of any
circumstance, change, development, event or state of facts arising out of or
attributable to any of the following, either alone or in combination: (1) the
industry and markets in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate
generally, (2) general economic or political conditions (including, but not
limited to, those affecting the securities markets, credit markets or interest
rates), (3) the public announcement or pendency of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby including, but not
limited to, the identity of the acquiror (including any delays or
cancellations of orders, contracts or payments for the Companys products or
services or any loss of customers or suppliers or changes in such
relationships or any loss of employees or labor disputes or employee strikes,
slowdowns, job actions or work stoppages or labor union activities), (4) any
shareholder or derivative litigation arising from allegations of a breach
of fiduciary duty relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (5) acts of war (whether or not declared), sabotage or terrorism,
military actions or the escalation thereof or other force majeure events (such
as natural disasters, acts of God or other events not within the reasonable
control of the Company) occurring after the date hereof, (6) any changes in
applicable Laws, regulations or accounting rules, or interpretations thereof
by courts or governmental agencies, (7) the failure of the Company to meet
its projections or the issuance of revised projections that are more
pessimistic than those at the time of this Agreement, (8) any increase in the
cost or availability of financing to the Merger Sub or Parent, or (9) the
taking of any action expressly contemplated by this Agreement or consented to
by Parent or Merger Sub; provided, further, however, that any change, event,
occurrence or effect referred to in clauses (1), (2), and (5) above shall be
taken into account in determining a Material Adverse Effect to the extent of
any disproportionate effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, relative to other companies operating in the same industries as the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

(b) The Company has previously furnished or otherwise made available to Parent
a true and complete copy of the Companys certificate of incorporation (the "
_Company Charter_ ") and bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), and the equivalent
organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended
to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full force and
effect. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any
provision of the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, or equivalent
organizational documents for each Subsidiary, except where any such violation
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Except for ownership of equity interests in its
Subsidiaries and other than as set forth in Section 4.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity
or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity.

11  unissued capital stock or voting securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. Each
of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and all such shares are owned by the Company or another wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company and are owned free and clear of all security
interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in voting rights,
charges or other encumbrances (collectively, " _Liens_ ") of any nature
whatsoever. Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of

such Company Stock Option, the price per share at which such Company Stock
Option may be exercised, the expiration date and the status of any Option

approval of this Agreement by the holders of at least a majority in voting
power of the outstanding Shares in accordance with the DGCL and the rules and
regulations of the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the " _Company Stockholder
Approval_ "), to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company
and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
subject, in the case of the consummation of the Merger and if required by
applicable Law, to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and to the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware as required by the DGCL. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms (except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by
general principles of equity). As of the date hereof, the Company Board has,
at a meeting duly called and held in which all directors are present, (i)
approved and declared fair to, advisable, and in the best interests of the
Companys stockholders, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the Companys
stockholders for their adoption, and (iii) subject to Section 6.4, has
resolved to recommend that the Companys stockholders approve this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that Section 253 of the
DGCL is inapplicable and unavailable to effectuate the Merger, the Company
Stockholder Approval is the only vote or consent of the holders of any class
or series of capital stock of the Company necessary to approve this Agreement
or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. The approval of
this Agreement by the Company Board constitutes approval of this Agreement
and the Merger for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL and represents the only
action necessary to ensure that Section 203 does not and will not apply to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger.



 

12 Section 4.4 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company,

or Company Bylaws or the equivalent organizational documents of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and
authorizations contemplated by clauses (i) through (v) of subsection (b)
below have been obtained and all filings described in such clauses have been
made, conflict with or violate any law (including common law), rule,

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective
properties are bound or (iii) subject to obtaining the consents listed in
Section 4.4(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, result in any breach or
violation of, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse
of time or both would become a default), or result in the loss of a benefit
under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or
acceleration of, or result in the creation of a Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any
Material Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties are bound, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any
such conflict, breach, violation, default, loss, right or other occurrence
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company,
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby,
do not and will not require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of,
action by, filing with or notification to, any governmental or regulatory
(including stock exchange) authority, agency, court commission, or other
governmental body (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ "), except for (i) such
filings as required under applicable requirements of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and under state securities and "blue sky"
laws, (ii) the filings required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust

ARTICLE V

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

PARENT AND MERGER SUB

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the
Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure
Letter_ ") (it being agreed that  



 

25  disclosure of any information in a particular section or subsection of the
Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any
other section or subsection of this Agreement to which the relevance of such
information is reasonably apparent), Parent and the Merger Sub, jointly and
severally, represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

Section 5.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

(a) Parent is a limited partnership and Merger Sub is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation. Each of Parent and Merger Sub (i) has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and (ii) is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii), for any such failures
to have such power and authority or to be so qualified or licensed or in good
standing as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means any event, change,
occurrence or effect that would prevent, materially delay or materially impede
the performance by Parent or Merger Sub of their respective obligations under
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Parent has previously furnished to the Company a true and complete copy of
the certificate of formation and limited partnership agreement of Parent and
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub, in each case as
amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full
force and effect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in violation of any
provision of its certificate of formation, limited partnership agreement,
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as applicable, in any material
respect.

Section 5.2 _Authority_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary
partnership or corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized
by the general partner of Parent and the board of directors of Merger Sub, and
no other partnership or corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger
Sub are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, subject in the case of the consummation of the Merger, to
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware as required by the DGCL. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of
them in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or by general principles of equity).



 

26 Section 5.3 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will not (i) conflict with or
violate the certificate of formation or limited partnership agreement of
Parent or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Merger Sub, (ii)
assuming that all consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by
clauses (i) through (v) of subsection (b) below have been obtained and the
waiting periods referred to therein have expired and any condition precedent
to such consent, approval, authorization or waiver has been satisfied and all
filings described in such clauses have been made, conflict with or violate any
Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or by which any of their respective
properties are bound or (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default), or result in the loss of a benefit under, or give
rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of,
any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective properties are bound, except, in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflict, breach,
violation, default, loss, right or other occurrence that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby, do not and will not require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Entity, except for (i) such filings as required under applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and under state securities and "blue sky" laws, (ii)
the filings required under the HSR Act and any filings required under Foreign
Antitrust Laws, (iii) such filings as necessary to comply with the
applicable requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market, (iv) the filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the Certificate of
Merger as required by the DGCL and (v) any such consent, approval,
authorization, permit, action, filing or notification the failure of which to

expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

with respect to Parent and any of its Subsidiaries that Parent furnishes to
the Company in writing specifically for use in any Company Disclosure Document
will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading (i) in the case of the Proxy Statement, as
supplemented or amended, if applicable, at the time such Company Proxy
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed to
stockholders of the Company and at the time such stockholders vote on
adoption of this Agreement, and (ii) in the case of any Company Disclosure
Document other than the Proxy Statement, at the time of the filing of such
Company Disclosure Document or any supplement or amendment thereto and at the
time of any distribution or dissemination thereof.

the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, (a) there is no

and complete copies of an executed commitment letter from Royal Bank of Canada
(the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, and subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, the lender parties thereto have committed to
lend the amounts set forth therein to Merger Sub for the purpose of funding
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ ").
A true, accurate and complete copy of the fee letter related to the Debt
Commitment Letter has been made available to the Company in redacted form.

funding in part, the Merger Consideration at the Closing as contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Equity Financing_ ", and together with the Debt

Commitment Letters are collectively referred to herein as the " _Financing
Commitment Letters_ ".

(c) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect
and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented
or modified in any respect. Each of the Commitment Letters, in the form so
delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and/or Merger
Sub, as applicable, and the other parties thereto. As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any
term or condition of the Commitment Letters. Parent is unaware of any fact or
occurrence existing on the date hereof that (with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both) would reasonably be expected to (w) make any of the assumptions
or any of the statements set forth in the Commitment Letters inaccurate, (x)
result in any of the conditions in the Commitment Letters not being satisfied,
(y) cause any of the Commitment Letters to be ineffective, or (z) otherwise
result in the funding contemplated in the Commitment Letters not

contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and/or Merger Sub have fully paid any
and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitment Letters to be

terms therein.

and are the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Guarantors,
(except to the extent that enforceability may be limited to by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general principals of
equity), and no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantors under
the Limited Guarantees.

any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this
Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. The

hereby.

Company hereby specifically disclaims any such other representations or
warranties.

questions regarding the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries with the
management of the Company, (b) has had access to the books and records of the

investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and has not relied on an representation or warranty by
any Person regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, except as expressly
set forth in Article V.

between Parent, Merger Sub or the  



 

29  Guarantors, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys management or
directors, on the other hand, as of the date hereof, that relate in any
way to the Company or the transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to the
Company Board approving this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby for purposes of the applicable provisions of the DGCL,

terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or on other terms
no less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub (including with respect to the
conditionality thereof), (ii) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account
the expected timing of the Marketing Period) all conditions applicable to
Parent and/or Merger Sub in such definitive agreements, and (iii) not permit
any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material
provision or remedy under the Debt Commitment Letter, if such amendment,
modification or waiver reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
without a corresponding increase in the amount of the committed Equity
Financing and/or the amount of cash on the Companys balance sheet as of the
Closing Date (as compared to the amount of cash on the Companys balance sheet
as of the date hereof) or amends the conditions precedent to the
Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent the Closing Date or make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely
to occur; provided, however, that Parent and/or Merger Sub may replace or
amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
agents or similar entities who did not execute the Debt Commitment Letter as
of the date hereof, or otherwise, so long as the terms would not expand upon
the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof or otherwise delay the Closing.

(b) In the event that all or any portion of the Debt Financing is not
provided in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter, (i)
Parent shall promptly notify the Company and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall
use their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from
alternative sources as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period),
on terms no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub (as
determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent and Merger Sub) than those in
the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") and, to obtain a
new financing commitment letter related to such Alternative Financing (the "
_Alternative Commitment Letter_ "). To the extent applicable, each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all  



 

33  actions and things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange promptly and
consummate the Alternative Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Alternative Commitment Letter in a timely manner, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to
the Alternative Financing (such definitive agreements, or any definitive
agreements entered into under Section 6.2(a), the " _Financing Agreements_
"), (ii) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of
the Marketing Period) all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in
such definitive agreements, and (iii) upon satisfaction of such conditions,
to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the funding of such Alternative
Financing; provided, that Parent and Merger Sub may replace or amend the
Alternative Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
agents or similar entities who did not execute the Alternative Commitment
Letter as of the date hereof, or otherwise, so long as the terms would not
expand upon the conditions precedent to the Alternative Financing as set
forth in the Alternative Commitment Letter as of the date hereof or otherwise
delay the Closing.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts
to cause their Representatives to, comply with the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter, the Alternative Commitment Letter, the Financing Agreements
and any related fee and engagement letters. Parent shall (i) furnish
complete, correct and executed copies of the Financing Agreements promptly
upon their execution for information purposes only, and (ii) otherwise keep
the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing (or the Alternative Financing). For purposes of this Agreement,
unless otherwise agreed among the parties hereto, the "Marketing Period" shall
mean the first period of 30 consecutive days after the date hereof throughout
which (i) (A) Parent shall have the Required Financial Information that the
Company is required to provide to Parent pursuant to Section 6.2(d) and (B) no
event has occurred and no conditions exist that would cause any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.3 to fail to be satisfied assuming the
Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such 30 consecutive day
period, and (ii) the conditions set forth in 7.1 have been satisfied (other
than conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing);
provided, that (x) the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date that is
the date on which the Debt Financing otherwise is obtained and (y) if the
Marketing Period would not end on or prior to August 1, 2008, the Marketing
Period shall commence no earlier than September 8, 2008, and (z) the Marketing
Period shall not be deemed to have commenced if, (1) after the date hereof and
prior to the completion of the Marketing Period, Ernst and Young LLP shall have
withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any of the financial statements
contained in the Company SEC Documents, (2) if the financial statements
included in the Required Financial Information that is available to Parent on
the first day of any such 30 consecutive day period would not be sufficiently
current on any day during such 30 consecutive day period to permit a
registration statement using such financial statements to be declared
effective by the SEC on the last day of the 30 consecutive day period or (3)
the Company issues a public statement indicating its intent to restate any
historical financial statements of the Company. During the Marketing Period,
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII as
described in Section 2.2, Parent shall be entitled to deliver written notice
to the Company on no less than three (3) Business Days notice of its
intention to effect a Closing (a "Closing Date Notice"); provided that (I) any
Closing Date Notice may be withdrawn and a new Closing Date Notice may be
delivered with respect to a later Closing Date on no less than three (3)
Business Days notice, and (II) the Closing Date specified in the Closing Date
Notice may be conditioned upon the simultaneous completion of the Debt  



 

34  Financing or the Alternative Financing, as the case may be; provided, that
if such Debt Financing is not completed for any reason at any time such
Closing Date Notice shall automatically be deemed withdrawn.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their respective Representatives to, provide to Parent and Merger Sub all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt
Financing or the Alternative Financing, including (i) participation in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions with prospective lenders and sessions with rating agencies, and
participation in a reasonable number of meetings and negotiating sessions
with respect to the definitive financing arrangements for the Debt Financing
or the Alternative Debt Financing, (ii) assisting with the preparation of
customary materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents,
private placement memoranda, bank and mezzanine information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar customary documents required in connection with the
Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing, including execution and delivery
of customary representation letters reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to the Company in connection with bank information memoranda, (iii)
as promptly as practical, furnishing Parent and its Debt Financing or
Alternative Financing sources with all financial statements, pro forma
financial information, financial data, audit reports and other information of
the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities
Act and of type and form customarily included in a registration statement on
Form S-1 (or any applicable successor form) under the Securities Act for a
public offering to consummate the offering(s) of debt securities contemplated
by any Alternative Commitment Letter, if applicable, assuming that such
offering(s) were consummated at the same time during the Companys fiscal
year as the offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by such Alternative
Commitment Letters, or as otherwise required in connection with the Debt
Financing or Alternative Financing and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (all such information in this clause (iii), the " _Required
Financial Information_ "), (iv) using reasonable best efforts to obtain
accountants comfort letters, legal opinions, appraisals, surveys,
engineering reports, title insurance and other documentation and items
relating to the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing, as reasonably
requested by Parent, (v) providing financial and other information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, including monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) within 30
days of the end of each month prior to the Closing Date, (vi) taking all
actions required to be taken by the Company prior to the Effective Time with
respect to the Convertible Notes and facilitating the settlement of the Call
Options and Warrants, (vii) executing and delivering any pledge and security
documents, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates, or
documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including a certificate of
the Chief Financial Officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to solvency matters) and otherwise reasonably facilitating the
pledging of collateral (including cooperation in connection with the pay off
of existing indebtedness and the release of related Liens, if any); provided,
that no obligation of the Company or any Subsidiary under such executed
documents shall be effective until the Effective Time, and (viii) taking all
corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, required
to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing or the Alternative
Debt Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to the
Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time. The Company will
cause to be provided (1) with respect to any indebtedness of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that is being repaid at or prior to the  



 

35  Effective Time, payoff letters, UCC termination statements, releases and
similar evidences of termination with respect to such indebtedness and (2)
a non-United States real property holding corporation affidavit dated as of
the Closing Date signed under penalty of perjury, and in form and substance
required under the Treasury Regulations issued pursuant to Section 1445(f)
and Section 897 of the Code, so that Parent is exempt from withholding any
portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration thereunder.

(e) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos
as may be reasonably necessary in connection with the Debt Financing or
Alternative Financing; provided, that such logos are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and its or their marks.

(f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Company and its Affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
Representatives shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any liability
to, any Person under, any financing that Parent may raise in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided
pursuant to this Section 6.2 and that Parent and Merger Sub shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates and their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and Representatives from and against
any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred
by any of them in connection with the Debt Financing and any Alternative
Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith. Upon
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, Parent shall
promptly reimburse the Company for any expenses and costs incurred in
connection with the Companys or its Affiliates obligations under this
Section 6.2(f). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability or obligation in
connection with the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing prior to the
Effective Time.

Section 6.3 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Except as set forth in
Section 6.1, nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its
Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct Parents or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations.

Section 6.4 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

(a) Subject to Sections 6.4(b)-(g), the Company agrees that neither it nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct its and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, including any
investment banker, attorney, consultant or accountant retained by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, propose or knowingly encourage
(including by providing information) or take any other action knowingly to
facilitate any inquiries, proposals, offers, discussions or requests with
respect to, or the making or completion of, or that may reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) 



 

36  engage or participate in any negotiations or discussions (other than to
state that they are not permitted to have discussions) concerning, or provide
or cause to be provided any non-public information or data relating to, or
afford access to the property, books and records of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, to any Person that has made or, to the knowledge of the Company,
is considering making, an Acquisition Proposal, or grant any waiver,
amendment or release under any standstill or confidentiality agreement, (iii)
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, it
is understood and agreed that any determination or action by the Company
Board permitted under Sections 6.4(b) or (c) or Section 8.1(c)(ii) shall not
be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.4(a). The Company agrees that in
the event any of its Representatives takes any action which, if taken by the
Company would constitute a breach of this Section 6.4, then the Company shall
be deemed to be in breach of this Section 6.4. The Company agrees that it will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.4(a), at any time
following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Companys receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may, in response to an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of
Section 6.4(a) and that the Company Board determines constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (i) furnish information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal if and only if, prior to providing such information such
Person has executed a confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar
to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, except that a
confidentiality agreement with any such Person shall not be required to
include paragraph 8 of the Confidentiality Agreement or any similar provision;
provided, however, that any material non-public information provided to such
Person has previously been provided to Parent, or is provided to Parent
contemporaneously as it is provided to such Person, and (ii) participate in
discussions or negotiations with such Person and its Representatives
regarding such Acquisition Proposal, if, but only if, in the case of both
clause (i) and clause (ii) above, the Company Board has concluded in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the
failure of the Company Board to furnish such information or engage in such
discussions or negotiations would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) change,
withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub its
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger or fail to make a reaffirmation
requested by Parent pursuant to Section 6.5(b), (ii) approve or recommend, or
cause or permit the Company to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
constituting or relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section
6.4(b)), (iii) except in connection with a tender offer contemplated by
Section 6.14, make any recommendation in connection with a tender offer or an
exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer, (iv) exempt
any Person or group from the restrictions contained in any state takeover or
similar  



 

37  laws, including Section 203 of the DGCL or otherwise cause such restrictions
or provisions not to be applicable to such Persons or group or (v) resolve or
publicly propose to take any such actions, and the Company shall not (I),
except as expressly set forth herein with respect to Parent and Merger Sub,
amend the Rights Agreement or take any action to amend, modify or waive
the Rights Agreement with respect to any Person other than Parent and Merger
Sub or (II) fail to include the Proxy Statement in the Recommendation (any of
the foregoing actions of the Company Board or committee thereof described in
clauses (i) through (v) above or by the Company described in clauses (I) and
(II) above, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 6.4, prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board or any committee thereof may
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, (A) if (1) the Company receives an
Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn and that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal,
(2) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable law, and (3)
the Company is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Section
6.4 including the following sentences of this Section 6.4(c); provided, that
the Company shall not enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal unless this Agreement shall have been validly terminated by
the Company in accordance with Section 8.1(c)(ii) (including the payment of
the Termination Fee in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.3(b)), or
(B) other than in response to an Acquisition Proposal, if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law. The Company shall not be entitled
to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal
unless (i) the Company has complied with the terms and conditions of Section
6.4, (ii) the Company has provided written notice (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ ") to Parent that the Company intends to take such action and
describing the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is
the basis of such action, including with such Notice of Superior Proposal all
information required to be provided pursuant to Section 6.4(d), (iii) during
the five (5) Business Day period following Parents receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its applicable
Representatives including its financial and legal advisors, to negotiate with
Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger
Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal, and (iv) following the end of such five (5) Business Day
notice period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys independent financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent to the Company in response to the Notice of Superior
Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of
Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any amendment
to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such Superior
Proposal shall require, at the end of the applicable notice period, a new
Notice of Superior Proposal and the Company shall be required to comply again
with the requirements of this Section 6.4(c); provided, that in any such
event, references to the five (5) Business Day notice period above shall be
deemed to be references to a forty-eight (48) hour notice period.



  

38 (d) The Company promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) shall advise
Parent orally and in writing of (i) the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal,
any inquiries, proposals or offers regarding any Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
any request for non-public information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to
be related to an Acquisition Proposal and (iii) any inquiry or request for
discussion or negotiation regarding an Acquisition Proposal, including in each
case the identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal (and, if
known, the identity of each of the debt and equity financing sources),
inquiry, proposal or offer and the material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer and, in the case of written materials
provided to the Company (including all financing letters), provide Parent
copies of such materials as promptly as reasonably practical. The Company
shall keep Parent informed on a current basis of the status, terms and
substance of any discussions or negotiations including amendments and
proposed amendments of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or
offer. The Company agrees that none of it or its Subsidiaries shall enter into
any confidentiality or other agreement with any Person after the date hereof
which prohibits the Company from complying with its obligations under this
Section 6.4.

(e) Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to stockholders in connection with the
making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from (ii) making
any required disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the judgment of
the Company Board, concluded in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, failure to disclose such information would
reasonably be expected to violate its obligations under applicable Law;
provided, that any disclosure permitted by this Section 6.4(e) (other than a
"stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) expressly reaffirms the Recommendation by the Company
Board within three (3) Business Days (and at least two (2) Business Days prior
to the Company Stockholders Meeting).

(f) No Adverse Recommendation Change, termination of this Agreement under
Section 8.1(c)(ii) or Section 8.1(d)(ii) or any similar action shall in any
event change, or be deemed to otherwise eliminate, the approval of this
Agreement by the Company Board and the transactions contemplated hereby for
purposes of causing the Rights Agreement, Takeover Laws or other state law
(including Section 203 of the DGCL) to become applicable to any of Parent,
Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates, this Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(g) As used in this Agreement:

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer
from any Person or group of Persons other than Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries relating to, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, (A) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the
Company whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net
income or assets of  



 

39  the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (B) the acquisition of
twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of any class
of capital stock of the Company or twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting
power represented by the outstanding voting securities of the Company, (C) a
tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any
Person or group of Persons beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more
of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company, or (D) the acquisition in any
manner, directly or indirectly, of over 20% of the consolidated total assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or to which twenty percent (20%) or more
of the Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are
attributable) including, for this purpose, the outstanding assets and equity
securities of the Subsidiaries of the Company, in each case other than the
Merger.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any Acquisition Proposal (A) on
terms which the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, to
be more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Shares than
the Merger, taking into account all of the terms, conditions and impact of
such proposal (including the likelihood, ability to finance, conditionality
and timing of consummation of such proposal and taking into account any and
all antitrust review or other regulatory process aspects as well as potential
litigation), and this Agreement and (B) that the Company Board believes is
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal and this Agreement
(including any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to by Parent
to the Company in response to such proposal or otherwise); provided that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "20%" in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"50%" and any transaction described in clause (A) of the definition of
Acquisition Proposal must result in a third party acquiring more than 50% of
the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company or all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Section 6.5 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within twenty (20)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement), the Company shall, with the
assistance and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of
Parent, prepare and shall cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement.
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and in responding to any comments of the
SEC staff thereon. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company the information relating to
it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. The Company shall
(i) promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement and any request by
the SEC for any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information, (ii) supply Parent with copies of all correspondence
between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) provide Parent
with an opportunity to review and comment on any such document filing or
response prior to their submission and to include in such document filing or
response any comments reasonably  



 

40  proposed by Parent. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to
correct, to the extent required by applicable Law, any information provided by
it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading
by filing an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
with the SEC and the Company shall disseminate such information to its
stockholders, as applicable. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of either the
Company or Parents Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors,
should be discovered by the Company or Parent, respectively, which, pursuant
to the Securities Act or Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or
a supplement to the Proxy Statement, such party shall promptly inform the
other.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Proxy
Statement by the SEC, the Company, acting through the Company Board,
shall (i) take all action necessary to establish a record date for, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company
Stockholders Meeting_ ") including, (x) not more than 5 Business Days after
the Proxy Statement has been cleared by the SEC, mailing the Proxy Statement
to the holders of Common Stock as of the record date established for the
Company Stockholders Meeting and (y) holding the Company Stockholders
Meeting; provided, however, that in no event shall such meeting be held
earlier than 60 days (and no later than 30 days following clearance of the
Proxy Statement by the SEC) following the date of this Agreement and any
adjournments or postponements of such meetings shall require the prior written
consent of Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned;
provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may require the Company
to adjourn or postpone such meeting one (1) time, (ii) shall advise Parent as
Parent may reasonably request, and at least on a daily basis on each of the
last ten Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, as to the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company
with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval and (iii) except to the
extent that the Company Board shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation
Change in accordance with Section 6.4(c), (A) include in the Proxy Statement
the recommendation of the Company Board that the stockholders of the Company
vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger (the "
_Recommendation_ "), (B) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its
stockholders the Company Stockholder Approval in favor of the adoption of the
agreement of merger (as such term is used in Section 251 of the Corporation
Law) contained in this Agreement required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and (C) publicly reaffirm
the Recommendation within two (2) Business Days after any request by Parent
which request may be made one (1) time by Parent (not including any requests
or communications by Parent with respect to any reaffirmations that are made
by the Company Board in response to any disclosure obligations as set forth in
Section 6.4(e)) no later than seven (7) Business Days prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting. At such Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall,
through the Company Board or any committee thereof, make the Recommendation.
Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Article VIII,
the Company shall establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a Company Stockholders Meeting at which it shall submit this
Agreement to its stockholders even if the Company Board shall have withdrawn,
modified or qualified its recommendation thereof or otherwise effected an
Adverse Recommendation Changed or proposed or announced any intention to do
so. Without the prior written consent of Parent, adoption of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) is the only
matter (other than procedural matters) which the Company shall propose to be
acted on by the Stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting.



 

41 Section 6.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII hereof, upon reasonable prior
written notice, the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its Subsidiaries, officers, directors and Representatives to, (i)
afford to Parent reasonable access during normal business hours, consistent
with applicable Law, to its officers, employees, financing sources and
Representatives, properties, offices, other facilities, documents, agreements,
contracts (including customer contracts) and books and records, (ii) promptly
furnish Parent with all financial, operating and other data and information
as Parent shall reasonably request (including, monthly financial reports
prepared by management consistent with past practice; and, as and when
received or developed, performance information regarding any "earn out"
obligations of the Company) and (iii) promptly upon request by Parent, furnish
Parent with a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or
received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date
hereof pursuant to the requirements of the federal or state securities or Tax
Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation
shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result
in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the
employees, in the aggregate, of the Company or its Subsidiaries of their
normal duties. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information to the extent that
such access or disclosure would (x) breach any agreement with any third-party,
(y) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by the
Company or (z) otherwise violate any applicable Law. The parties shall seek
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the immediately preceding sentence applies.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its
Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent
or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms; provided, that (i) Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to
contact third parties as potential sources of equity financing for the
transactions contemplated hereby so long as such Persons agree to be bound by
the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) the
execution of this Agreement by the Company constitutes written consent of the

Section 6.7 _Further Action; Efforts_. 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be  



 

42  done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to
cause the conditions set forth in Article VII to be satisfied and to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided that all obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
relating to the Financings shall be governed exclusively by Section 6.2 and
not this Section 6.7. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
each party hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) make
appropriate filings under and take all reasonable steps as may be necessary to
receive approval from, or to avoid an action or proceeding under, any
Antitrust Law, including an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within five (5) Business
Days of the date hereof and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary, proper
or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable, including by requesting
early termination of the waiting period provided for in the HSR Act, (ii)
obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, licenses, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Entity or third
party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and to maintain and preserve the benefits of any
Contracts or agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that in obtaining consent or approval from any
Person (other than a Governmental Entity) with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, (x) without the prior written consent of Parent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, none of the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay any amount to any Person or incur
any liability or other obligation or materially modify any Contract and (y)
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to pay or commit to pay any
amount or incur any liability or obligation. In the event that the Company
shall fail to obtain any third party approval, consent, registration,
licenses, permit, authorization or other confirmation described in clause (ii)
above, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall take such
actions as are reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize any adverse effect
upon the Company and Parent and their respective businesses resulting, or
which could be reasonably expected to result, after the Effective Time, from
the failure to obtain such approval, consent, registration, licenses, permit,
authorization or other confirmation.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.7(a)
to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law,
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other U.S. or foreign
Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) permit the other party to review any
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity
or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other
Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other
applicable Governmental Entity or  



 

43  other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meetings and conferences, and (iv) subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information and advice of counsel, each of
the parties hereto shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the information
relating to the other parties and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted
to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 6.7(a) and (b), if any objections are asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law
or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the
DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any
Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
Parent and Merger Sub and the Company shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in
order to resolve such objections or suits which, in any case if not
resolved, could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, (i) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or
business of Parent or its Subsidiaries or the Company or its Subsidiaries and
(ii) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that after the
Closing would limit the freedom of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporations) freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporations) businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be
required in order to resolve such objections or suits; provided, however, that
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be obligated to, become subject to, or
consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental
Entity to sell, hold separate, dispose of any assets or conduct or change its
business unless such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order
is binding on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or on Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as the case may be, only in the event the
Closing occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the
provisions of this Section 6.7 obligate the Guarantors or any of their
Affiliates to agree to (i) limit in any manner whatsoever its ability
to conduct their respective businesses or otherwise or own and control the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or (ii) divest any portfolio investments.

(d) Subject to the obligations under Section 6.7(c), in the event that any
administrative or judicial Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other
agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such Action and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



 

44 (e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, Foreign Antitrust Laws and all other Laws that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition.

Section 6.8 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters; Other Plans_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any current or former employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each a " _Company Employee_ ") may
have under any Company Plan, except as otherwise agreed in writing between
Parent or any of its Affiliates and a Company Employee, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for a period commencing
at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain
the severance-related provisions of existing Company Plans set forth in
Section 6.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and to provide 100% of the
severance payments and benefits required thereunder to be provided to any
Company Employee terminated during that twelve (12) month period.

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have
under any Company Plan, except as otherwise agreed in writing between Parent
or any of its Affiliates and a Company Employee, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for the period commencing
at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain
for any Company Employee (i) subject to paragraph (a) above,
cash compensation levels (such term to include salary, bonus opportunities,
commissions and severance, but shall not include any equity-based
compensation) that are in the aggregate no less favorable than, and (ii)
benefits (including the costs thereof to Company Plan participants) provided
under Company Plans to the extent such Company Plans are disclosed in Section
6.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter (other than any equity based benefits)
that in the aggregate are no less favorable than, the overall cash
compensation levels and benefits ( other than any equity-based compensation or
benefits) maintained for and provided to such Company Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Plan or interfere with the
Surviving Corporations right or obligation to make such changes as are
necessary to conform to or comply with applicable Law or that are permitted
by the existing terms of any Company Plans, and nothing in this Agreement
shall be construed to limit the ability of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, or any of their Affiliates to terminate the employment of any
employee (including any Company Employee) at any time and for any or no
reason.

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give Company Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility and vesting and benefit accruals (but not for purposes of benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plans), under any employee
compensation, incentive, and benefit (including vacation) plans, programs,
policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Company Employees as
of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation (other than any equity based plans or arrangements or any non-
qualified deferred compensation plans or arrangements) for the Company
Employees service with the Company, its Subsidiaries and their predecessor
entities (each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time under an analogous Company
Plan. With  



 

45  respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent and its Subsidiaries shall, to the extent
permitted by the law: (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition
or eligibility limitations in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs
to the extent waived or otherwise satisfied under an analogous Company
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) give effect, in
determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations for the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs, to claims incurred and amounts paid
by, and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees under similar Company Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing
between Parent or any of its Affiliates and a Company Employee or as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, Parent will honor, and will cause its Subsidiaries
to honor, in accordance with its terms, (i) each existing employment, change
in control, severance and termination protection plan, policy or agreement of
or between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any officer, director or
employee of that company to the extent disclosed in Section 6.8(d)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, (ii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective
Time under any non equity-based bonus or bonus deferral plans, programs or
agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the extent such plans,
programs and agreements are disclosed in Section 6.8(d)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter and (iii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective Time
pursuant to outstanding restoration plans, programs or agreements, and all
vested and accrued benefits under any non equity-based employee benefit,
employment compensation or similar plans, programs, agreements or arrangements
of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the extent such plans, programs,
agreements and arrangements are disclosed in Section 6.8(d)(iii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall
prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Plan or interfere with the
Surviving Corporations right or obligation to make such changes as are
necessary to conform to or comply with applicable Law or that are permitted by
the existing terms of any Company Plan.

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries,
for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending ninety (90) days
thereafter, not to effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those
terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of
1988 (together with any similar state or local Law, " _WARN_ ") without
complying with all provisions of WARN or any similar provision of applicable
foreign Law.

(f) No provision of this Section 6.8 or any other provision of this
Agreement, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or
modify any Company Plan, any benefit plan, program, agreement, or arrangement
or the terms of any sub-agreements or sub-plans, terms and conditions,
restrictive covenants, or participation requirements thereof, except and to
the extent such amendment is explicitly contemplated by the express language
of this Agreement; (ii) shall limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
and any of its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them; (iii) is intended to confer upon any current or
former employee (including any Company Employee) or any other Person any right
to employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason of
this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment;
or (iv) is intended to confer upon any Person (including any Company Employee)
any rights or remedies hereunder, including  



 

46  the right to enforce any obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
contained herein as a third party beneficiary; provided that this Agreement
shall be deemed to confer on the applicable individuals the right to the
payments described in Section 3.2.

(g) The Company shall take any actions with respect to the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") as are necessary to provide that (i)
participation in the ESPP shall be limited to those employees who were
participants on the date hereof, (ii) such participants may not increase
their payroll deduction election or purchase elections from those in effect on
the date hereof, (iii) the ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately before
the Effective Time, (iv) each purchase right under the ESPP outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time shall be automatically exercised by
applying the payroll deductions of each current participant in the ESPP for
such offering period, as defined in the ESPP (each, an " _Offering Period_ ")
to the purchase of whole shares of Company common stock (subject to the
provisions of the ESPP regarding the number of shares purchasable per
participant) at a purchase price per share equal to 95% of the lower of (A)
the fair market value per share of Company common stock on the Purchase Date
(as defined in the ESPP) and (B) the fair market value per share of Company
common stock on the last business day before the Effective Time and (v) there
shall not be any additional Offering Period commencing following the date of
this Agreement under the ESPP.

Section 6.9 _Takeover Laws_. Parent, the Company and their respective Boards
of Directors shall (i) take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that no
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement or the transactions provided for in this
Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes
applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that
the transactions provided for in this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement or the transactions provided for in this Agreement.

Section 6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of
such communication could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, (b) any Action commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of
its Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Transaction Litigation_ "), it being agreed that
Parent shall be given an opportunity to participate, at its own cost and
expense, in the defense and/or prosecution of such Transaction Litigation or
(c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause
or result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII not
being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed
in violation of any provision of this Agreement; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall not (i) cure any
breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or
(ii) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice; provided
further, that failure to give prompt notice pursuant to clause (c) shall not
constitute a failure of a condition to the Merger set forth in Article VII  



 

47  except to the extent that the underlying fact or circumstance not so
notified would standing alone constitute such a failure. The parties agree
and acknowledge that, except with respect to clause (c) of the first sentence
of this Section 6.10, the Companys compliance or failure of compliance with
this Section 6.10 shall not be taken into account for purposes of
determining whether the condition referred to in section (c) of Annex II to
this Agreement shall have been satisfied.

Section 6.11  _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each
present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer and director of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all
claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ "), incurred in connection with any
Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an
officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions and
actions contemplated hereby, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws as at the date hereof. In the
event of any such Action, each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any Action from Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws as at the date hereof, within
ten (10) Business Days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from
the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that any Person to whom
expenses are advanced first provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification; provided further, that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to indemnify or advance expenses to any
Indemnified Party in connection with an Action (or part thereof) initiated by
such Indemnified Party unless such Action (or part thereof) was authorized by
the board of directors.

(b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company agree
that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of
any Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or in any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified
Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and
continue in full force and effect, and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute policies
or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a "tail  



 

48  policy," in either case of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in the aggregate
than such policy with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective
Time; provided, however, that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be
required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one
policy year annual premiums in excess of 400% of the last annual premium paid
by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to
be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage
as reasonably practicable for such amount; provided further, that if the
Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail policy" and the coverage thereunder
costs more than 400% of such last annual premium, the Surviving Corporation
shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for 400%
of such last annual premium. Parent and the Company shall work together to
purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on
terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby. If such tail prepaid policy has been obtained prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and
effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by the Surviving Corporation.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this Section 6.11 shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such Action.

(e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.11 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

Section 6.12 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to approve in advance in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.



 

49 Section 6.13 _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other
before issuing, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
shall not issue any such press release or make any public announcement without
the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system.

Section 6.14 _Tender Offer_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise, in the event that
Parent determines, the Parent shall have the right but not the obligation
to commence, or to cause Merger Sub or another one of its affiliates (such
entity, the " _Tender Offeror_ ") to commence, at any time after the date
hereof, a cash tender offer for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of
Common Stock at a purchase price per share, net to the holders thereof, equal
to the Merger Consideration; provided, that (i) it shall be a condition to the
obligation of the Tender Offeror to accept for payment and pay for shares of
Common Stock tendered in the tender offer that more than 50% of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock be tendered in the tender offer (such
condition, the " _Minimum Condition_ "), (ii) except for the Minimum
Condition, the obligation of the Tender Offeror to accept for payment and pay
for shares of Common Stock tendered in the tender offer shall not be
materially more conditional than the obligation of the Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger, (iii) the Parent, Merger Sub and/or the Tender
Offeror shall be obligated to consummate (x) the Merger or (y) a merger
providing for cash consideration at least equal to the Merger Consideration
and which shall otherwise be on terms and conditions no less favorable to the
holders of shares of Common Stock than the Merger, (iv) the tender offer shall
comply with all applicable Laws, including the Exchange Act, Sections 14(d)
and 14(e) thereof and the rules, regulations and schedules promulgated
thereunder, and (v) the tender offer shall otherwise be conducted on the
terms and conditions set forth on _Annex II_. The parties hereto shall (a)
negotiate in good faith and as expeditiously as practicable any and all
amendments, modifications or waivers of this Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement necessary or appropriate to implement this Section
6.14, (b) make any and all amendments or modifications to the Proxy Statement,
(c) make any and all filings with or submissions to (and/or make any and all
amendments or modifications to existing filings or submissions), and seek any
and all consents, authorizations and permits from, any Governmental Authority
necessary or appropriate in light of the tender offer, including under the
HSR Act, any other Antitrust Law or other applicable Law or otherwise, and (d)
otherwise use reasonable best efforts to implement this Section 6.14 and to
ensure the Merger and the tender offer comply with all applicable Laws and
are consummated. For avoidance of doubt, the Company acknowledges that the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.19 and 4.20 apply to
the tender offer described in this Section 6.14.

Section 6.15 _Termination of Indebtedness_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall deliver to Parent copies of payoff letters, in commercially
reasonable form, from the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement and
shall make arrangements for the release of all Liens and the release of all
obligations and guarantees under the Credit Agreement over the Companys
and its Subsidiaries properties and assets securing such obligations, in
each case subject to delivery of funds as arranged by Parent and Merger Sub,
if necessary.



 

50 Section 6.16 _Settlement of Related Actions_. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding
or agree to compromise settle or come to an arrangement regarding any Action
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or consent
to the same unless Parent shall otherwise consent in writing; provided, that
with respect to any Action involving monetary damages only, such consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Section 6.17 _Resignation of Directors_. The Company shall cause each of the
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent
requested by Parent no less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, to submit a letter of resignation or otherwise be removed, effective on
the Closing Date.

Section 6.18 _Termination of Affiliate Arrangements_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall terminate all Contracts and other arrangements with
all officers, directors and shareholders of the Company, without any
monetary or other liability having been incurred or satisfied by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under such Contracts or other arrangements, on or
after the date hereof.

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger

(b) by either Parent or the Company:

(i) if the Merger has not been consummated on or before October 31, 2008 (the
" _Outside Date_ "); provided, that neither party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i) if any action of
such party or failure of such party to perform or comply with the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement shall have been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to be consummated by the
Outside Date and such action or failure to perform constitutes a breach of
this Agreement;

(ii) if any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall
have issued a judgment, order, injunction, rule or decree, or taken any other
action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such judgment, order,
injunction, rule, decree or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable; provided, that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall have used its reasonable best
efforts to contest, appeal and remove such judgment, order, injunction,
rule, decree, ruling or other action in accordance with Section 6.7; or

(iii) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained by
reason of the failure to obtain such Company Stockholder Approval at a duly
held Company Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement
thereof.

(c) by the Company:

perform any of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement (other than the breach or failure to perform by either
of Parent or Merger Sub of any of its covenants and agreements in Section 6.2,
which such breach or failure to perform shall permit the Company to terminate
this Agreement only on or following the Outside Date) which breach or failure
to perform (A) would result in the failure of a condition set forth in Section
7.1 and (B) cannot be cured by the Outside Date; provided, that the Company
shall have given Parent written notice, delivered at least thirty (30) days
prior to such termination, stating the Companys intention to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(i) and the basis for such
termination; provided further, that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(i) if it is then in
material breach of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement;



 

53 (ii) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in order to
enter into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a
transaction that is a Superior Proposal; provided, that the Company has
complied with Section 6.4; or

(iii) if the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 of this
Agreement are satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied at Closing) on the final day of the Marketing Period and
Parent or Merger Sub has failed to consummate the Merger no later than five
(5) Business Days after the later of (A) the final day of the Marketing Period
and (B) the date on which the Company notifies Parent that all conditions to
closing set forth in Section 7.4 have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at
Closing but which conditions would be satisfied if such date were the Closing
Date).

(d) by Parent:

(i) if the Company shall have materially breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would result in the failure
of a condition set forth in Section 7.1 and (B) cannot be cured by the
Outside Date; provided, that Parent shall have given the Company written
notice, delivered at least thirty (30) days prior to such termination, stating
the Parents intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(d)(i) and the basis for such termination; provided further, that Parent
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(d)(i) if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement; or

(ii) (A) the Company Board shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation
Change, or (B) the Company shall have breached in any material respect any of
its obligations under Section 6.4, Section 6.5 or, if applicable, Section

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1
(other than under clause (a)) shall give written notice of such termination
to the other party specifying the provision or provisions of this Section 8.1
pursuant to which such termination is purportedly effected.

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of the
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company, except that the Confidentiality Agreement and the

(Public Announcements), this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 (Fees and Expenses),
Section 8.4 (Amendment or Supplement), Section 8.5 (Extension of Time; Waiver)
and Article IX (General Provisions) of this Agreement shall survive the
termination hereof and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub or the Company, except (a) the Company or Parent may have liability
as provided in Section 8.3 and (b) subject to the provisions of Section 8.3
and Section 9.10, nothing shall relieve any party from liability for willful
breach of its representations and warranties or covenants under this Agreement
or fraud.



 

54 Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger, and the
other transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring
such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger or the Offer (as contemplated
by Section 6.14) is consummated.

(b) In the event that:

(i) (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or
communicated to the Company following that date hereof, (B) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent or Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) or by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i), and (C) within twelve (12) months after such
termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or shall have consummated, an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that
for purposes of clause (C) of this Section 8.3(b)(i), the references to
"twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)";

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(ii); or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii)

then, in any such case, the Company shall pay Parent or an Affiliate of Parent
designated in writing by Parent a termination fee of $50,000,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall the Company
be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion and
_provided_ that in no event shall any portion of the Termination Fee be paid
to any Apax Guarantor. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the exclusive
remedy of Parent and Merger Sub with respect to a termination of this
Agreement described in Sections 8.3(b)(i)-(iii). Payment of the Termination
Fee, if applicable, shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to the
account or accounts designated by Parent (i) on the earlier of the execution
of a definitive agreement with respect to or consummation of any transaction
contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, as applicable, in the case of a
Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i); (ii) simultaneously
with, and as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of, termination, in
the case of a termination by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) (and
any purported termination pursuant to this Section shall be void and of no
force and effect unless the Company shall have made such payment) or (iii)
within two (2) Business Days after termination by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(ii).

(c) In the event that the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(c)(iii), then Parent shall pay to the Company a termination
fee of $65,000,000 in cash, (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "), it being
understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. If the Parent Termination Fee
becomes payable pursuant to this Section 8.3(c), it shall be paid no later
than two (2) Business Days after the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(iii). Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this Section
8.3(c) shall be paid by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated in writing by the Company.

  

 

55 (d) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amounts due pursuant to
this Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
other party for the amounts set forth in this Section 8.3, such paying party
shall pay the other party its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in
this Section 8.3 from the date of termination of this Agreement through the
date such payment is actually received at a rate per annum equal to 6%.

(e) Except in the event of willful breach by either Parent or Merger Sub of
its representations and warranties or covenants under this Agreement or
fraud by Parent or Merger Sub, (i) the Companys right to receive payment of
the Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(c) or the
Guarantors pursuant to the Limited Guarantees in respect thereof shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates against the
Parent Parties for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of
the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
or otherwise (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include to the
extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by a party or a partys
stockholders, taking into consideration all relevant matters, including other
combination opportunities, the time value of money, a partys obligation to
mitigate, and relevant market conditions (tested over a relevant period), "
_Company Damages_ "), and (ii) upon payment of such amount none of the Parent
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (except that
Parent shall also be obligated with respect to Section 8.3(d) and the
Guarantors under the Limited Guarantees in respect of Section 8.3(d)). Without
limiting the Companys right to receive the Parent Termination Fee, in the
event of willful breach by either Parent or Merger Sub of its representations
and warranties or covenants under this Agreement or fraud by Parent or Merger
Sub, the Company and any of the Affiliates that are controlled by the Company
shall be entitled to seek Company Damages against Parent or Merger
Sub; provided, that the maximum aggregate liability (inclusive of the Parent
Termination Fee) of Parent or Merger Sub shall not exceed the Parent Liability
Limitation (as defined below).

(f) Without limiting Parents rights under Section 9.10, and except in the
event of willful breach by the Company of its representations and warranties
or covenants under this Agreement or fraud by the Company, (i) Parents right
to receive payment from the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section
8.3(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent and Merger Sub
against the Company Parties for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the
failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not
be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may
include to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by a party or a
partys stockholders, taking into consideration all relevant matters,
including other combination opportunities, the time value of money, a partys
obligation to mitigate, and relevant market conditions (tested over a relevant
period), " _Parent Damages_ "), and (ii) upon payment of such amount(s), none
of the Company Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions  



 

56  contemplated hereby (except that the Company shall also be obligated with
respect to Section 8.3(d)). Without limiting Parents rights to receive the
Termination Fee, or its remedies under Section 9.10, in the event of willful
breach by the Company of its representations and warranties or covenants under
this Agreement or fraud by the Company, Parent shall be entitled to seek
Parent Damages against the Company, whether or not the Termination Fee has
been paid or is payable; provided, that the maximum aggregate liability
(inclusive of the Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses) of the Company
shall not exceed the Company Liability Limitation.

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the maximum aggregate
liability of Parent and Merger Sub for all Company Damages shall be limited
to $100,000,000 and including, to the extent of any payment, the Parent
Termination Fee) plus any amounts that may be payable under Section 8.3(d)
(the " _Parent Liability Limitation_ ") and the maximum aggregate liability
of Company for all Parent Damages shall be limited to $100,000,000 (including,
to the extent of any payment, the Termination Fee) plus any amounts that may
be payable under Section 8.3(d) (the " _Company Liability Limitation_ "), and
in no event shall (i) the Company or any of the Affiliates that are controlled
by the Company seek or permit to be sought on the Companys behalf any other
Company Damages or any other recovery, judgment or damages of any kind,
including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against Parent, Merger
Sub, the Guarantors or any other Parent Parties in excess of the Parent
Liability Limitation in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) Parent or Merger Sub seek any other Parent
Damages or any other recovery, judgment or damages of any kind, including
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any other Company Parties in excess of the Company Liability
Limitation in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8.3 shall limit the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub under Section 9.10. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that each of them has no right of recovery against, and
no personal liability shall attach to, in each case with respect to Parent
Damages, any of the Company Parties (other than the Company to the extent
provided in this Agreement), through the Company or otherwise, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or
on behalf of the Company against any Company Party, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise. The Company acknowledges and
agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and no personal
liability shall attach to, in each case with respect to Company Damages, any
of the Parent Parties (other than Parent to the extent provided in this
Agreement and the Guarantors to the extent provided in the Limited
Guarantees), through Parent or otherwise, whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company
veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent against the Guarantors
or any other Parent Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any
legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
applicable Law, or otherwise, except for its rights to recover from the
Guarantors (but not any other Parent Party (including any general partner or
managing member)) under and to the extent provided in the Limited Guarantees
and subject to the Parent Liability Limitation and the other limitations
described therein. Recourse against the Guarantors under the Limited
Guarantees shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its
Affiliates against the Guarantors and any other Parent Party (other than
Parent to the extent provided in this Agreement) in respect of any liabilities
or obligations arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company acknowledges that both Parent
and Merger Sub are newly-formed companies and do not have any material assets
or liabilities except in connection with this Agreement.



 

57 Section 8.4 _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented by the parties by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors or general partner, as applicable, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether before of after the Company Stockholder
Approval has been obtained; provided, however, that after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment may be made that pursuant
to applicable Law or the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market requires
further approval or adoption by the stockholders of the Company without such
further approval or adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties in
interest at the time of the amendment.

by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other parties set forth in this
Agreement or any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) subject to
applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of
the other parties contained herein; provided, however, that after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no waiver may be made that pursuant to
applicable Law or the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market
requires further approval or adoption by the stockholders of the Company
without such further approval or adoption. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of
such party. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.
The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder.

argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the courts in Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or
its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from
any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the suit,
action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts.

Section 9.9 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any
party without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void;
provided, however, that Merger Sub may assign any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger
Sub of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 9.10 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that immediate and irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed by the Company in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached by the Company. Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
against the Company in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate
court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of
Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in
which case, in any Delaware state or federal court within the State of
Delaware), this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is
entitled at law or in equity (in each case subject to the Company Liability
Limitation in respect of Parent Damages). Each of the parties hereby further
waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at
law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or
other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties further
acknowledge and agree that none of the Company or its Affiliates shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement against Parent or Merger Sub or otherwise to
obtain any equitable relief or remedy against Parent or Merger Sub and that
the Companys sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such breaches,
acts or omissions by Parent or Merger Sub shall be the remedies available to
the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions of, and subject to the
limitations of, Section 8.3.



 

62 Section 9.11 _Currency_. All references to "dollars" or "$" or "US$" in this
Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is the currency used for all
purposes in this Agreement.

Section 9.12 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion
of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

Section 9.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT OR THE COMPANY IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

Section 9.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other party.

Section 9.15 _Facsimile Signature_. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile signature and a facsimile signature shall constitute an original for
all purposes.

Section 9.16 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of Law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this
Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is expressly
waived.

  _ANNEX I_

Form of Rights Plan Amendment

See Attached. _ANNEX II_

1\. Subject to compliance with Section 6.14 of the Agreement, Merger Sub (i)
shall not be required to accept for payment or pay for any tendered Shares,
(ii) may delay the acceptance for payment of, or the payment for, any
tendered Shares, and (iii) may terminate or amend the tender offer
contemplated under Section 6.14 of the Agreement (the " _Offer_ ") as to
Shares not then paid for, in the event that at or prior to the scheduled
expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended pursuant to Section 6.14 of the
Agreement): (A) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied; (B) the
applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger) under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated; or (C)
any of the following conditions exists:

(a) there shall be instituted or pending any temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment, order or decree issued
by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or
prohibition shall be in effect, or a Law shall have been enacted, entered,
promulgated, enforced or deemed applicable by any Governmental Entity that, in
any case, prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Agreement;

(b) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Sections
4.1 (Organization, Standing and Power), 4.2 (Capital Stock), 4.3 (Authority),
4.19 (State Takeover Statutes), 4.20 (Rights Plan) and 4.22 (Brokers) shall be
true and correct in all respects, and the remaining representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement (without giving effect
to any materiality, "Material Adverse Effect" or dollar thresholds
qualifications therein) shall be true and correct except for such failures to
be true and correct as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, in each case as of the Closing with the same effect
as though made as of the Closing (except to the extent expressly made as of
another date, in which case as of such date) and the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a certificate, dated as of the Closing and signed by its
chief executive officer or another senior officer on behalf of the Company,
certifying to the effect that to such officers knowledge the conditions set
forth in this Section (b) have been satisfied;

(c) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its obligations under the Agreement and such breach or failure
to perform shall not have been cured and the Company shall have delivered to
Parent a certificate, dated as of the Closing and signed by its chief
executive officer or another senior officer on behalf of the Company,
certifying to the effect that to such officers knowledge the conditions set
forth in this Section (c) have been satisfied;

(d) (i) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred and not been
withdrawn, or (ii) the Company shall have approved, endorsed or recommended
to the Companys stockholders an Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger or
shall have publicly proposed to effect any of the foregoing; or

(e) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.



 

1 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Merger Sub and Parent and
may be asserted by Merger Sub or Parent regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to such condition, in whole or in part at any applicable time or
from time to time in their sole discretion prior to the expiration of the
Offer, except that the conditions relating to receipt of any approvals from
any Governmental Entity may be asserted at any time prior to the acceptance
for payment of Shares, and all conditions (except for the Minimum Condition)
may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in their sole discretion in whole or in
part at any applicable time or from time to time, in each case subject to the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC. The failure of Parent or Merger Sub at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Parent delivers payment of
the Parent Termination Fee to the Company, then the Offer shall automatically
terminate.

2\. _Parent Representation on Board_. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof, the Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, from and
after the closing of the Offer, the Company Board and each committee thereof
shall include a number of representatives of Parent that is in proportion to
the percentage ownership of the Company represented by the Shares tendered and
purchased by Parent in the Offer.

3\. _Short-form Merger_. Upon closing of the Offer, if permitted by the DGCL,
the Company shall take all action necessary and permitted by applicable Law or
the rules of any applicable stock exchange (including the issuance of a "top-
up" option to Parent) to give effect to a "short form" merger in lieu of the
Merger; provided, that the per share consideration payable in such merger
shall be a cash amount equal to the Merger Consideration.

4\. _Subsequent Offering Periods_. Subject to Parents obligations under
Section 6.14 of the Merger Agreement (including with respect to the timing of
the consummation of the Merger), the Offer may be extended at Parents
discretion up to the Outside Date.

5.  _Shareholder Lists_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Company shall provide Parent and its representatives with reasonable access to
the Companys shareholder lists and take other reasonable and customary
actions as required to facilitate the Offer.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Annex II_ , neither Parent nor
Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth herein to be
satisfied if such failure was caused by the breach of the Agreement by Parent
or Merger Sub, or the failure by Parent or Merger to fulfill any of their
respective obligations thereunder.

The capitalized terms used in this _Annex II_ and not defined herein shall
have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the " _Agreement_ "), dated as of April 11, 2008, between TZ Holdings,
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, TZ Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and The TriZetto
Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation.
