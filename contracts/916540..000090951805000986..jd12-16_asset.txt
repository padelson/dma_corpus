respective terms all Excluded Liabilities. "Excluded Liabilities" shall mean
all Liabilities of Seller arising out of, relating to or otherwise in respect
of the Business on or before the Closing Date and all other Liabilities of
Seller other than the Assumed Liabilities. Excluded Liabilities shall include
the following Liabilities and in no event shall Purchaser assume any
liability for the matters set out in this Section 2.4 except

Closing Balance Sheet:   (a) all Liabilities in respect of any products
sold and/or services performed by Seller on or before the Closing Date;  
(b) except to the extent specifically provided in Article VIII,
all Liabilities arising out of, relating to or with respect to (i) the

Further Conveyances and Assumptions; Consent of Third Parties.   (a) From
time to time following the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all
such further conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases and aquittances and
such other instruments, and shall take such further actions, as may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate to assure fully to Purchaser and
its successors or assigns, all of the properties, rights, titles,
interests, estates, remedies, powers and privileges intended to be conveyed
to Purchaser under this Agreement and the Seller Documents and to assure
fully to Seller and its successors and assigns, the assumption of the
liabilities and obligations intended to be assumed by Purchaser under this
Agreement and the Purchaser Documents, and to otherwise make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.   (b) Nothing in this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be construed as an attempt or agreement to assign any Purchased Asset,
including any Contract, Permit, certificate, approval, authorization or other
right, which by its terms or by Law is nonassignable without the consent of a
third party or a Governmental Body or is cancelable by a third party in the
event of an assignment ("Nonassignable Assets") unless and until such consent
shall have been obtained. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such consents promptly. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, in the event consents to the assignment thereof cannot be
obtained, such Nonassignable Assets shall be held, as of and from the Closing
Date, by Seller in trust for Purchaser and the covenants and obligations
thereunder shall be performed by Purchaser in Seller\'s name and all benefits
and obligations existing thereunder shall be for Purchaser\'s account. Seller
shall take or cause to be taken at Seller\'s expense such actions in its name
or otherwise as Purchaser may reasonably request so as to provide
Purchaser with the benefits of the Nonassignable Assets and to effect
collection of money or other consideration that becomes due and payable under
the Nonassignable Assets, and Seller shall promptly pay over to Purchaser all
money or other consideration received by it in respect of all Nonassignable
Assets. As of and from the Closing Date, Seller authorizes Purchaser, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the Nonassignable Assets,
at Purchaser\'s expense, to perform all the obligations and receive all the
benefits of Seller under the Nonassignable Assets and appoints Purchaser its
attorney-in-fact to act in its name on its behalf with respect thereto.  
2.6 Bulk-Sales Laws. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by Seller with the
requirements and provisions of any "bulk-transfer" Laws of any jurisdiction
that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of
the Purchased Assets to Purchaser; provided, however, that, except
with respect to the Assumed Liabilities, Seller agrees (a) to pay and
discharge when due or to contest or litigate all claims of creditors which
are asserted against Purchaser or the Purchased Assets by reason of such
noncompliance, (b) to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser from and
against any and all such claims in the manner provided in Article X and (c)
to take promptly all necessary action to remove any Lien which is placed on
the Purchased Assets by reason of such noncompliance. Any "bulk-transfer" Law
that addresses Taxes shall be governed by Article XI and not by this Section
2.6.    16   2.7 Purchase Price Allocation. Not later than ninety days
after the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller will work together in good faith
to prepare and deliver a copy of Form 8594 and any required exhibits thereto
(the "Asset Acquisition Statement") allocating the Total Consideration among
the Purchased Assets. If Seller and Purchaser cannot agree to an Asset
Acquisition Statement, each shall prepare its own proposed Asset Acquisition
Statement, and such disagreement shall be resolved in accordance with the
same procedures set forth in Sections 3.5(b) and 3.5(c). The Total
Consideration paid by Purchaser for the Purchased Assets shall be allocated
in accordance with the Asset Acquisition Statement as finalized pursuant to
this Section 2.7, and all income Tax Returns and reports filed by Purchaser
and Seller relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets shall be prepared
consistently with such allocation. For purposes of this Section 2.7, the
Purchased Assets include the covenant not to compete as set forth in Section
7.7.   2.8 Right to Control Payment. Purchaser shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to make any payment due from Seller with respect to any
Excluded Liabilities which are not paid by Seller within five Business Days
following written request for payment from Purchaser; provided, however, that
if Seller advises Purchaser in writing during such five Business Day period
that a good faith payment dispute exists or Seller has valid defenses to non-
payment with respect to such Excluded Liability, then Purchaser shall not
have the right to pay such Excluded Liability. Seller agrees to reimburse
Purchaser promptly and in any event within five Business Days following
written notice of such payment by Purchaser for the amount of any payment
made by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 2.8. Payment under this Section
2.8 shall be made promptly and in full, without regard to Article X.   2.9
Proration of Certain Expenses. Subject to Section 2.4(d) and Section 11.2
with respect to Taxes, all expenses and other payments in respect of the
Owned Property and all rents and other payments (including any
prepaid amounts) due under the Real Property Leases and any other leases
constituting part of the Purchased Assets shall be prorated between Seller,
on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, as of the Closing Date.
Seller shall be responsible for all rents (including any percentage rent,
additional rent and any accrued tax and operating expense reimbursements and
escalations), charges and other payments of any kind accruing during any
period under the Real Property Leases or any such other leases up to and
including the Closing Date. Purchaser shall be responsible for all such
rents, charges and other payments accruing during any period under the Real
Property Leases or any such other leases after the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall pay the full amount of any invoices received by it and shall submit a
request for reimbursement to Seller for Seller\'s share of such expenses and
Seller shall pay the full amount of any invoices received by it and Purchaser
shall reimburse Seller for Purchaser\'s share of such expenses.   2.10
Accounts Receivable. Seller shall provide reasonable assistance to Purchaser
in the collection of accounts receivable. If Seller shall receive payment in
respect of accounts receivable that are included in the Purchased Assets,
then Seller shall promptly forward such payment to Purchaser.    17  
ARTICLE III   CONSIDERATION   3.1 Consideration.   (a) The aggregate
consideration for the Purchased Assets shall be (i) (A) an amount in cash
(the "Closing Cash Payment") equal to (x) $70.5 million, less (y) the amount
of Indebtedness related to Seller\'s credit facilities outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Payoff Indebtedness Amount"),
plus (B) that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Closing Issued
Shares") equal to 20% of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock as of
8 a.m. Central Time on the Closing Date, calculated on a Fully Diluted
Basis (the "Purchase Price"), and (ii) the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities (together with the Purchase Price, the "Total Consideration").
The Purchase Price will be subject to adjustment pursuant to Sections 3.4,
3.5 and 3.6.   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Closing Share Price"
shall be an amount equal to the per share closing price of Parent Common
Stock on the American Stock Exchange (as reported by The Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition, or if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source)
for the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date.   3.2 Payment
of Purchase Price.   (a) On the Closing Date, Parent shall pay the Adjusted
Closing Cash Payment (as defined below), less the Cash Escrow Amount, to
Seller, which amount shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds into an account designated by Seller in writing not fewer than three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.   (b) As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to Seller
certificates representing the Closing Issued Shares, less the Escrowed Shares
(as defined below), registered in the names of the holders of record of the
outstanding membership units of Seller set forth on Company Disclosure
Schedule 3.2(b) (the "Unitholders"), pro rata in accordance with their
ownership interests, and Seller shall promptly distribute such certificates
to the Unitholders.   (c) On the Closing Date, Parent shall pay the Payoff
Indebtedness Amount on behalf of Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds as directed by the holders of such Indebtedness.   (d)
Promptly after Closing, Seller shall pay all amounts owed under the Unit
Appreciation Agreement to the beneficiaries of the Unit
Appreciation Agreement and all amounts owed under Seller\'s Long-Term
Incentive Plan, in each case less applicable withholding and employment
taxes.    18   3.3 Indemnity Escrow. On the Closing Date, Parent shall,
on behalf of Seller, deliver to U.S. Bank, National Association, as agent to
Parent and Seller (the "Escrow Agent"), to an account designated by the
Escrow Agent, an amount in immediately available funds equal to $3.5 million
(the "Cash Escrow Amount") and that number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the quotient of $6.5 million divided by the Closing Share Price (the
"Escrowed Shares" and together with the Cash Escrow Amount, the "Indemnity
Escrow Amount"), in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A,
which will be executed at the Closing, by and among Parent, Seller and the
Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agreement"). Any payment Seller is obligated to
make to any Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to Article X shall be paid,
to the extent there are sufficient funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account, by
release of funds to the Parent Indemnified Parties from the Indemnity Escrow
Account by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms set forth in the
Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall release the Indemnity Escrow Amount
(to the extent not utilized to pay Purchaser for any indemnification claim)
to Seller in accordance with the terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement. The
Indemnity Escrow Amount retained by the Escrow Agent for any claims for
indemnification under Article X asserted but not settled before the
applicable release date under the Escrow Agreement ("Unresolved Claims")
shall be released by the Escrow Agent (to the extent not utilized to pay
Purchaser for any such claims resolved in favor of Purchaser) upon their
resolution in accordance with Article X and the Escrow Agreement.   3.4
Closing Statement. At least two (2) Business Days before Closing (the
"Estimate Statement Delivery Date"), Seller shall cause to be prepared
and delivered to Parent an estimated balance sheet of Seller as of the end
of business on the Closing Date and prior to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet") and
a statement (the "Estimate Statement") setting forth Seller\'s good faith
estimate of Net Working Capital (as defined below) derived from the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet ("Initial Closing Working Capital") and the
corresponding Adjusted Closing Cash Payment to be paid at Closing, if any.
Seller shall provide Parent with copies of or reasonable access to such books
and records as are reasonably necessary for purposes of verifying the amounts
set forth in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimate Statement.
"Net Working Capital" means, at the time of determination, the current assets
of the Business (less Excluded Assets included in such current assets),
reduced by the current liabilities of the Business (which shall include all
Indebtedness, whether current or long-term, and any Liabilities related to
employees such as projected workers\' compensation claims and, to the extent
not paid before Closing, all amounts owed by Seller under the Unit
Appreciation Agreement to the beneficiaries of the Unit
Appreciation Agreement and all amounts owed under Seller\'s Long-Term
Incentive Plan, but shall exclude the Payoff Indebtedness Amount and Excluded
Liabilities included in such current liabilities), in each case as determined
in accordance with GAAP, and the accounting principles set forth on Company
Disclosure Schedule 3.4 (the "Agreed Principles"). An example, for
illustrative purposes only, of the calculation of Net Working Capital as of
October 1, 2005 is set forth on Company Disclosure Schedule 3.4. Seller shall
use the latest available information as of the Estimate Statement Delivery
Date to prepare the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and to calculate the
Initial Closing Working Capital and the Adjusted Closing Cash Payment. The
preparation of the Estimate Statement shall be for the purpose of determining
the difference between Initial Closing Working Capital and Target Working
Capital. If Initial Closing Working Capital exceeds $250,000 ("Target Working
Capital"), the Closing Cash Payment shall be increased by the amount of such
excess (such increase, a "Positive Adjustment") and, if Target Working
Capital exceeds Initial Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash Payment
shall be reduced by the amount of such excess (such reduction, a "Negative
Adjustment"). "Adjusted Closing Cash Payment" means the Closing Cash Payment
plus any Positive Adjustment or the Closing Cash Payment minus any Negative
Adjustment, as applicable.    19   3.5 Purchase Price Adjustment.   (a)
As promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty days after the Closing
Date, Parent shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller an unaudited
balance sheet of Seller (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and a closing statement
(the "Closing Statement") and a certificate based on such Closing Statement
setting forth Parent\'s calculation of Net Working Capital derived from the
Closing Balance Sheet ("Closing Working Capital"). The preparation of
the Closing Statement shall be for the purpose of determining the difference
between Initial Closing Working Capital and Closing Working Capital.   (b)
If Seller disagrees with the amounts reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet
or Parent\'s calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to
Section 3.5(a), Seller may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Closing Statement, deliver a notice to Parent disputing such
amounts reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet and/or disagreeing with such
calculation of Closing Working Capital and setting forth Seller\'s
calculation of such amounts. Any such notice of dispute or disagreement shall
specify those items or amounts as to which Seller disagrees, and Seller shall
be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the
Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing
Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(a).   (c) If a notice of
disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(b), Parent and
Seller shall, during the fifteen (15) days following such delivery, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the proper amounts set
forth on the Closing Balance Sheet and the amount of Closing Working Capital,
which amount shall not be less than the amount thereof shown in Parent\'s
calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(a) nor more than the amount
thereof shown in Seller\'s calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(b).
If the parties so resolve all disputes, the Closing Balance Sheet and the
computation of Closing Working Capital, as amended to the extent necessary to
reflect the resolution of the dispute, shall be conclusive and binding on
the parties. If during such period, Parent and Seller are unable to reach
an agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause Ernst and Young LLP (or if
Ernst and Young LLP is unable or unwilling to accept its mandate, an
independent nationally recognized accounting firm to be mutually agreed upon
by Parent and Seller, in either such case, the "Independent Accountant") to
review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
determining the proper amounts on the Closing Balance Sheet and calculating
Closing Working Capital (it being understood that in making such
determination and calculation, the Independent Accountant shall be
functioning as an expert and not as an    20  arbitrator). In making such
determination and calculation, the Independent Accountant shall consider only
those items or amounts in the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement
and Parent\'s calculation of Closing Working Capital as to which Seller has
disagreed. The Independent Accountant shall deliver to Parent and Seller, as
promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than thirty days from the
date of engagement of the Independent Accountant), a report setting forth
such determination and calculation, which amount shall not be less than the
amount thereof shown in Parent\'s calculation delivered pursuant to Section
3.5(a) nor more than the amount thereof shown in Seller\'s
calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(b). Such report shall be final
and binding upon Parent and Seller. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Independent Accountant\'s review and report shall be borne equally by Parent
and Seller.   (d) Parent and Seller shall, and shall cause their
respective representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing
Working Capital and in the conduct of the review referred to in this Section
3.5, including the making available to the extent necessary of books,
records, work papers and personnel.   (e) If Initial Closing Working
Capital exceeds Final Working Capital, Seller shall pay to Parent, in the
manner and with interest as provided in Section 3.5(f), the amount of such
excess as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, to the extent there are
sufficient funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account, by release of funds to
Parent from the Indemnity Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement. If Final Working Capital exceeds Initial Closing
Working Capital, Parent shall pay to Seller, in the manner and with interest
as provided in Section 3.5(f), the amount of such excess as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price. "Final Closing Balance Sheet" and "Final Working Capital"
mean, respectively, the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Working Capital (i)
as shown in Parent\'s calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(a) if no
notice of disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to
Section 3.5(b); or (ii) if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, (A) as
agreed by Parent and Seller pursuant to Section 3.5(c) or (B) in the absence
of such agreement, as shown in the Independent Accountant\'s calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(c); provided, however, that in no event
shall Final Working Capital be more than Seller\'s calculation of
Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(b) or less than
Parent\'s calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to
Section 3.5(a).   (f) Any payment pursuant to Section 3.5(e) shall be made
within three Business Days after Final Working Capital has been determined by
wire transfer by Parent or Seller, as the case may be, of immediately
available funds to the account of such other party as may be designated in
writing by such other party prior to such transfer. The amount of any payment
to be made pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall bear interest from and
including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per
annum equal to the rate of interest published from time to time by The Wall
Street Journal, Eastern Edition (under the heading "Money Rates"), as the
"prime rate" during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment.
Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it
relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and
the actual number of days elapsed.    21   3.6 Additional Contingent
Consideration.   (a) In addition to the Purchase Price paid to Seller on the
Closing Date (as it may be adjusted), depending upon the market price of the
Parent Common Stock on the True-Up Date (as hereinafter defined), Parent
shall, if required hereunder, deliver to Seller additional consideration in
the form of certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock
registered in the names of the Unitholders who hold, directly or as Escrowed
Shares, Remaining Issued Shares (as hereinafter defined), pro rata in
accordance with their respective percentage of Remaining Issued Shares held
by them, directly or as Escrowed Shares, immediately prior to the True-Up
Date, and Seller shall promptly distribute such certificates to such
Unitholders. For purposes of determining whether any such additional
consideration shall be paid by Parent hereunder, on the last day of the 13th
full consecutive month following the Closing Date (the "True-Up Date"),
Parent shall deliver to Seller a schedule setting forth the True-Up Market
Price of the Parent Common Stock. For purposes hereof, "True-Up Market Price"
shall mean, with respect to the Parent Common Stock, on a per share basis (as
adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, combination
or recapitalization), an amount equal to the average of the per share closing
price of Parent Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange (as reported by
The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, or if not reported thereby, any
other authoritative source), for each of the trading days included in the
ninety (90) prior consecutive calendar days, ending with the calendar day
immediately preceding the True-Up Date.   (b) In the event that the product
of (i) the True-Up Market Price and (ii) the aggregate number of Closing
Issued Shares (as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, combination
or recapitalization) is less than $70.5 million, Parent will issue to Seller
certificates representing an additional number of shares of Parent Common
Stock registered in the names of the Unitholders who hold, directly or as
Escrowed Shares, Remaining Issued Shares, which number of shares shall be
calculated by Parent as follows:   (i) First, the "Target Share Price" shall
be determined by  dividing (A) $70.5 million by (B) the aggregate number of
Closing  Issued Shares (as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, 
combination or recapitalization);   (ii) Second, the "Value Gap" shall be
determined by multiplying  (A) the aggregate number of Closing Issued Shares
(including without  duplication the Escrowed Shares, but excluding any
Escrowed Shares  released to Parent in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow  Agreement, and as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, 
combination or recapitalization), less the number of any such Closing  Issued
Shares (as so adjusted) transferred by the Unitholders (except  transfers by
gift or into trust) on or after the Closing Date (the  "Remaining Issued
Shares") by (B) the difference between (x) the  Target Share Price and (y)
the higher of the True-Up Market Price or  $3.60 (as adjusted for any stock
split, stock dividend, combination or  recapitalization); provided that the
difference in subclause (B) is a  positive number, if not, then the "Value
Gap" shall be zero; and    22   (iii) Third, the number of additional
shares of Parent Common  Stock to be issued in accordance with this Section
3.6 (the "True-Up  Shares") shall be determined by dividing (A) the Value Gap
by (B) the  higher of (x) the True-Up Market Price and (y) $3.60 (as adjusted
for  any stock split, stock dividend, combination or recapitalization), 
rounded to the nearest whole number.   (c) Certificates representing the
True-Up Shares registered in the names of the Unitholders who hold, directly
or as Escrowed Shares, Remaining Issued Shares shall be delivered by Parent
to Seller no later than the 20th Business Day following the True-Up Date and
allocated among all of the Unitholders who hold, directly or as Escrowed
Shares, Remaining Issued Shares in accordance with their respective
percentage of Remaining Issued Shares held by them immediately prior to the
True-Up Date; provided, however, that no fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock will be issued hereunder; and, provided further, however, that the
total number of True-Up Shares to be registered in the name of each
Unitholder who holds, directly or as Escrowed Shares, Remaining Issued Shares
shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. Seller shall promptly
distribute the certificates representing such True-Up Shares to
the appropriate Unitholders.   ARTICLE IV   CLOSING AND TERMINATION  
4.1 Closing Date. The consummation of the purchase and sale of the Purchased
Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities provided for in Article
II hereof (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and
Manges LLP located at 200 Crescent Court, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75201 (or
at such other place as the parties may designate in writing) at 10:00 a.m.
(Dallas time) on a date to be specified by the parties (the "Closing Date"),
which date shall be no later than the third Business Day after satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article IX (other than conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), unless
another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto.   4.2 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated
prior to the Closing as follows:   (a) At the election of Seller or Parent
on or after May 15, 2006 (such date, as it may be extended under this Section
4.2(a), the "Termination Date") if the Closing shall not have occurred by the
close of business on such date; provided, that the terminating party is not
in material default of any of its obligations hereunder; and provided
further, that (A) either Parent or Seller shall have the option to extend,
from time to time, the Termination Date for additional periods of time, not
to exceed 60 days in the aggregate (or such longer period as Parent and
Seller may mutually agree) if all other conditions to the Closing are
satisfied or capable of then being satisfied and the sole reason that the
Closing has not been consummated is that the condition set forth in Section
7.4 has not been satisfied due to the failure to obtain the necessary   
23  consents and approvals under applicable Laws or an Order of a
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction shall be in effect and Parent,
Purchaser or Seller are still attempting to obtain such necessary consents
and approvals under applicable Laws, or are contesting (x) the refusal of the
relevant Governmental Body to give such consents or approvals, or (y) the
entry of any such Order, in court or through other applicable proceedings;
and (B) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.2(a)
shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted, directly or indirectly, in, the
failure of the Closing to be consummated by the Termination Date;   (b) by
mutual written consent of Seller and Parent;   (c) by written notice (i)
from Parent to Seller that there has been an event, change, occurrence or
circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate, with any other events,
changes, occurrences or circumstances, has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) from Seller to Parent that
there has been an event, change, occurrence or circumstance that,
individually or in the aggregate, with any other events, changes, occurrences
or circumstances, has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect;   (d) by Seller or Parent if there shall be in
effect a final nonappealable Order of a Governmental Body of competent
jurisdiction restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 4.2(d) shall not be available to
a party if such Order was primarily due to the failure of such party to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;   (e) by Parent, if
Seller shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of Seller shall have become untrue, in either case
such that the conditions set forth in Section 9.1(a) or 9.1(b) would not be
satisfied and such breach is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being
cured, shall not have been cured within fifteen days following receipt by
Seller of notice of such breach from Parent;   (f) by Seller, if Parent
shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of Parent shall have become untrue, in either case
such that the conditions set forth in Section 9.2(a) or 9.2(b) would not be
satisfied and such breach is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being
cured, shall not have been cured within fifteen days following receipt by
Parent of notice of such breach from Seller;   (g) by Parent if (i) a Seller
Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred or (ii) the Board of
Managers of Seller or any committee thereof (x) shall not have rejected any
Takeover Proposal within fifteen (15) Business Days of the making thereof
(including, for these purposes, by taking no position with respect to the
acceptance by Seller\'s unitholders of a tender offer or exchange offer,
which shall constitute a failure to reject such Takeover Proposal) or (y)
shall have failed to publicly reconfirm the Seller Board Recommendation
within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of a written request from
Parent that it do so if such request is made following the making by any
Person of a Takeover Proposal;    24   (h) by Seller or Parent if the
Seller Unitholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the Seller
Unitholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof; provided, however, that the right of Seller to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 4.2(h) shall not be available to
it if it has failed to comply in all material respects with its obligations
under Section 7.6 or 7.16(b);   (i) by Seller or Parent if the Parent
Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the Parent Stockholders
Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;

this Section 4.2(i) shall not be available to it if it has failed to comply
in all material respects with its obligations under Section 7.16(c);   (j)
by Parent on or before February 28, 2006, if (i) Parent\'s Environmental

shall have revealed any circumstances that could reasonably be expected to
result in (A) the criminal prosecution of Seller or any director, officer or
employee of Seller under Environmental Laws, (B) any suspension or closure of
operations at Seller\'s properties or facilities or the revocation

amounts reserved therefor on the Balance Sheet by at least $2.75 million, or
(ii) Parent\'s operational due diligence review of Seller shall have revealed
any deficiencies in the Purchased Assets that indicate that Parent would not
be able to continue to operate the combined businesses of Parent and Seller
for the year following Closing at a capital expenditure cost equal to or less
than 150% of the current annual capital expenditure budgets of Parent and
Seller, on a combined basis; or   (k) by Seller on or before February 28,
2006, if (i) Seller\'s Environmental Assessment (as defined in Section
7.11(b) below) at Parent\'s properties shall have revealed any circumstances
that could reasonably be expected to result in (A) the criminal prosecution
of Parent or any director, officer or employee of Parent under Environmental
Laws, (B) any suspension or closure of operations at Parent\'s properties or
facilities or the revocation or termination of any material Environmental
Permits or (C) any Environmental Costs and Liabilities that, individually or
in the aggregate, will or could reasonably be expected to result in
expenditures to cure in excess of the amounts reserved therefor on Parent\'s
balance sheet as at October 1, 2005 by at least $2.75 million, or (ii)
Seller\'s operational due diligence review of Parent shall have revealed any
deficiencies in Parent\'s assets that indicate that Parent would not be able

Seller, on a combined basis.    25   4.3 Procedure upon Termination. In
the event of termination and abandonment by Parent or Seller, or both,
pursuant to Section 4.2 hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be
given to the other party or parties, and this Agreement shall terminate, and
the purchase of the Purchased Assets hereunder shall be abandoned, without
further action by Parent, Purchaser or Seller.   4.4 Effect of Termination.
In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated as provided herein,
then each of the parties shall be relieved of their duties and obligations
arising under this Agreement after the date of such termination and such
termination shall be without liability to Parent, Purchaser or Seller;
provided, however, that (a) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to Section 4.2(e), Seller, in addition to any other Liabilities
accruing hereunder shall be liable for and shall pay within five Business
Days of such termination the cost of (i) all filing or other fees paid by
Parent or Purchaser to any Governmental Body in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by Parent or Purchaser in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby; (b) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to Section 4.2(g), Seller, in addition to any other Liabilities accruing
hereunder or otherwise, shall be liable as set forth in Section 4.5 hereof;
(c) if this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or Seller pursuant to
Section 4.2(a) and all other conditions to the Closing have been satisfied or
are capable of then being satisfied and the sole reason that the Closing has
not been consummated is that the condition set forth in Section 9.1(q) has
not been satisfied due to the failure of Purchaser to obtain the necessary
Financing or if this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section
4.2(f), Parent, in addition to any other Liabilities accruing hereunder shall
be liable for and shall pay within five (5) Business Days of such termination
the cost of (i) all filing or other fees paid by Seller to any Governmental
Body in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; (d) the obligations of the parties set
forth in this Section 4.4, Section 4.5 and Articles XIII hereof shall survive
any such termination and shall be enforceable hereunder; and (d) nothing in
this Section 4.4 shall relieve Parent or Seller of any Liability for a
willful breach of this Agreement prior to the effective date of such
termination.   4.5 Termination Fee.   (a) In the event that this Agreement
is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 4.2(g), then Seller shall pay to
Parent a termination fee of $4.23 million in cash (the "Termination Fee"). In
addition, Seller shall pay to Parent all of the expenses of Parent, including
all out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including all reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants, financial advisors and investment bankers
to a party hereto and its Affiliates), up to $1.0 million in the aggregate,
incurred by Parent in connection with or related to the legal, financial and
regulatory diligence of Seller and the authorization, preparation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement, the preparation,
printing, filing and mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4
and the prospectus contained therein, the filing of any required notices
under applicable Antitrust Laws or other regulations and all other matters
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Expenses").
Such Expenses shall include, without limitation, fees and related charges of
accountants and consultants.    26   (b) Any payment required to be made
pursuant to Section 4.5(a) shall be made to Parent promptly following
termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 4.2(g) (and in
any event not later than two Business Days after delivery to Seller of notice
of demand for payment); and, with regard to Expenses payable pursuant to
Section 4.5(a) above, such payment shall be made to Parent not later than two
Business Days after delivery to Seller of an itemization setting forth in
reasonable detail all such Expenses of Parent (which itemization may be
supplemented and updated from time to time by such party until the 60th day
after such party delivers such notice of demand for payment). All such
payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account to be designated by Parent.   (c) In the event that Seller shall
fail to pay the Termination Fee and/or Expenses required pursuant to this
Section 4.5 when due, such fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be, shall
accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such Termination Fee
and/or Expenses, as the case may be, became due, at a rate equal to the rate
of interest publicly announced by Citibank, in the City of New York, from
time to time during such period, as such bank\'s Prime Lending Rate, plus 2%.
In addition, if Seller shall fail to pay such fee and/or Expenses, as the
case may be, when due, Seller shall also pay to Parent all of Parent\'s costs
and expenses (including attorneys\' fees and related charges) in connection
with efforts to collect such Termination Fee and/or Expenses, as the case may
be. Seller acknowledges that the Termination Fee, Expense and the
other provisions of this Section 4.5 are an integral part of this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this
Agreement.   (d) Seller acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a
breach of this Agreement, the payment of the Termination Fee and/or Expenses
shall not constitute the exclusive remedies available to Parent, and that
Parent shall be entitled to the remedies set forth in Section 13.2, including
injunction and specific performance, and all additional and other remedies
available at law or in equity to which Parent may be entitled.   ARTICLE

5.3(a), and assuming the Seller Unitholder Approval is obtained and the

under, or result in the creation of any Liens upon any of the properties or
assets of Seller under, any provision of (i) the operating agreement and by-

Financial Statements.   (a) Seller has delivered to Parent copies of (i) the
audited balance sheets of Seller as at January 1, 2005, January 3, 2004 and
December 28, 2002 and the related audited statements of income and of cash
flows of Seller for the years then ended and (ii) the unaudited balance sheet
of Seller as at October 1, 2005 and the related statement of income and cash
flows of Seller for the nine month period then ended (such audited and
unaudited statements, including the related notes and schedules thereto, are

Statements is complete and correct in all material respects, has been
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied (except with respect to
the unaudited financial statements for normal recurring year-end adjustments
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not    29  be material)
without modification of the accounting principles used in the preparation
thereof throughout the periods presented and presents fairly in all material
respects the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of Seller as at the dates and for the periods indicated.   For the
purposes hereof, the unaudited balance sheet of Seller as at October 1, 2005
is referred to as the "Balance Sheet" and October 1, 2005 is referred to as
the "Balance Sheet Date."   (b) Seller makes and keeps books, records and
accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of its assets. Seller maintains systems of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management\'s general
or specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only
in accordance with management\'s general or specific authorization; and (iv)
the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the actual levels at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences.   (c) Seller\'s principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to
Seller\'s auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Managers of Seller
(i) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect Seller\'s ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for Seller\'s
auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Seller\'s internal controls.   (d) Seller has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to
ensure that material information relating to Seller is made known to
Seller\'s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by
others within those entities; and, to the Knowledge of Seller,
such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting
Seller\'s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to
material information.   (e) Seller\'s records, systems, controls, data and
information are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under the exclusive
ownership and direct control of it and Seller\'s accountants. Seller
maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP.   5.5 No
Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth on Company Disclosure Schedule
5.5, Seller has no Indebtedness or Liabilities (whether or not required under
GAAP to be reflected on a balance sheet or the notes thereto) other than
those (i) specifically reflected in, fully reserved against or otherwise
described in the Balance Sheet or the notes thereto, (ii) incurred in the
Ordinary Course of Business since the Balance Sheet Date, or (iii) that
are immaterial, individually or in the aggregate, to Seller.    30   5.6
Title to Purchased Assets; Sufficiency. Seller owns and has good title to
each of the Purchased Assets (except as could not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect) free and
clear of all Liens other than Permitted Exceptions. The Purchased Assets
constitute all of the Properties used in or held for use in the Business and
are sufficient for Purchaser to conduct the Business from and after
the Closing Date without interruption and in the Ordinary Course of Business,
as it has been conducted by Seller.   5.7 Absence of Certain Developments.
Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth on Company
Disclosure Schedule 5.7, since the Balance Sheet Date, (a) Seller has
conducted the Business only in the Ordinary Course of Business and (b) there
has not been any event, change, occurrence or circumstance that, individually
or in the aggregate, with any other events, changes, occurrences or
circumstances, has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, since the
Balance Sheet Date or as set forth on Company Disclosure Schedule 5.7:  
(i) there has not been any damage, destruction or loss, whether  or not
covered by insurance, with respect to the Purchased Assets  having a
replacement cost of more than $500,000 for any single loss or  $1.0 million
for all such losses;   (ii) other than in the Ordinary Course of Business,
Seller has  not awarded or paid any bonuses to Former Employees or Employees
of  Seller, except to the extent accrued on the Balance Sheet, or entered 
into any employment, deferred compensation, long-term incentive,  severance,
stay bonus, bonus, or similar agreement (nor amended any  such agreement) or

Exchange Act and the rules of the American Stock Exchange, (ii) filings
required under and compliance with the applicable requirements of the HSR Act
and (iii) such other consents, waivers, approvals, Orders,
Permits, authorizations, declarations, filings or notifications that, if not
obtained, made or given, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.   6.5 Litigation. There are no Legal
Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent and Purchaser, threatened
that are reasonably likely to prohibit or restrain the ability of Parent or
Purchaser to enter into this Agreement or consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.   6.6 Financial Advisors. Except for Harris Nesbitt
Corp. (whose fees and expenses shall be paid by Parent), no Person has acted,
directly or indirectly, as a broker, finder or financial advisor for Parent
or Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and no Person is entitled to any fee or commission or like payment
in respect thereof.   6.7 Voting Requirements. The affirmative vote (in
person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the shares of Parent
Common Stock cast at the Parent Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof to approve the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock
as consideration for the Purchased Assets (the "Parent Stockholder Approval")
is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the capital stock
of Parent necessary to approve the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock

Documents. Parent has filed and furnished all required reports, schedules,
forms, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and other statements with the
SEC on or since March 17, 2005, including, but not limited to, the Form 10-K
filed by Parent on March 17, 2005 (collectively, and in each case including
all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference
therein, the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of their respective effective dates
(in the case of Parent SEC Documents that are registration statements filed
pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of
their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other Parent SEC
Documents), the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may
be, applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC
Documents as of such respective dates contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated
financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents comply as
to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as indicated in the notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto)
and fairly present in all material respects the financial position of Parent
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods
then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments).    54   6.9 Information Supplied. Subject to the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section
5.28, none of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or
on behalf of Parent or Purchaser specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (a) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 or any
amendments or supplements thereto are filed with the SEC or at the time it
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and (b)
the Joint Proxy Statement will, on the date it is first mailed to unitholders
of Seller and stockholders of Parent, and at the time of the Seller
Unitholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The
Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor
Purchaser makes any representation or warranty with respect to any
information supplied by or on behalf of Seller for inclusion in any of the
foregoing documents.   6.10 Environmental Matters. Except as set forth on
Parent Disclosure Schedule 6.10 hereto and except as could not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect:   (a) the operations of
Parent, with respect to its business, are and have been in compliance with
all applicable Environmental Laws, which compliance includes obtaining,
maintaining in good standing and complying with all Environmental Permits
necessary to operate its business except for non-compliance that would not
reasonably be expected to result in the Business incurring material
Environmental Costs and Liabilities and no action or proceeding is pending
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened to revoke, modify or terminate any
such Environmental Permit, which is necessary and material to the operation
of the Business, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no facts, circumstances or
conditions currently exist that could adversely affect such continued
material compliance with Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits or
require currently unbudgeted capital expenditures to achieve or maintain such
continued material compliance with Environmental Laws and Environmental
Permits;   (b) with respect to its business, Parent is not the subject of
any outstanding written Order or Contract with any Governmental Body or
Person respecting (i) Environmental Laws, (ii) Remedial Action or (iii) any
Release or threatened Release of a Hazardous Material;    55   (c) no
claim is pending or to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent,
alleging, with respect to its business, that Parent may be in violation of
any Environmental Law or any Environmental Permit or may have any Liability
under any Environmental Law including, but not limited to, claims relating to
noise or odors, other than such claims that are routine in nature and would
not, individually or in the aggregate, result in the Business incurring
material Environmental Costs and Liabilities;   (d) to the Knowledge of
Parent, no facts, circumstances or conditions exist with respect to its
business or any property currently or formerly owned, operated or leased by
Parent or any property to which Parent arranged for the disposal or treatment
of Hazardous Materials that could reasonably be expected to result in
Parent\'s business incurring unbudgeted material Environmental Costs or
Liabilities;   (e) to the Knowledge of Parent, there are no investigations
of its business, or currently or previously owned, operated or leased
property of Parent pending or threatened which could reasonably be expected
to lead to the imposition of any material Environmental Costs or Liabilities
or Liens under Environmental Law;   (f) there is not located at any of
Parent\'s owned or leased real property, or at any property previously owned,
operated or leased by Parent during Parent\'s ownership, operation or lease,
any (i) underground storage tanks, (ii) landfill, (iii) surface impoundment,
(iv) asbestos-containing material or (v) equipment containing polychlorinated
biphenyls;   (g) Parent with respect to its business has no residual
liability with respect to abandoned or former properties, including any
obligation to remove or demolish on-site structures or close wastewater
lagoons or ponds, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, none of Parent\'s owned or
leased real property have any structures or features, including abandoned
buildings or wastewater lagoons or ponds (other than those being used in
compliance with Environmental Laws) requiring removal, demolition, or
closure; and   (h) Parent has made or will make available to Seller prior to
January 15, 2006 all material environmentally related audits, studies,
reports, analyses and results of investigations that have been performed with
respect to any currently or previously owned, leased or operated properties
of Parent or material documentation relating to pending or threatened claims
or investigations pursuant to Environmental Laws, to the extent such
materials are in the possession, custody or control of Parent.   6.11
Financing. Purchaser is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
cause Purchaser to be unable to obtain financing in accordance with the terms
of the term sheet previously provided to Seller (the "Term Sheet"). The
amount of debt financing, if obtained in accordance with the terms of
the Term Sheet, together with the equity financing to be provided by Parent,
will provide sufficient funds for Purchaser to consummate the
Transaction.    56   6.12 Full Disclosure. No representation or warranty
of Parent contained in this Agreement or any of the Purchaser Documents and
no written statement made by or on behalf of Parent to Seller pursuant to
this Agreement or any of the Purchaser Documents contains an untrue statement
of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements contained herein or therein not misleading. There is no fact or
circumstance which Parent has not disclosed to Seller in writing which could
reasonably be expected to lead Seller to conclude that a Parent Material
Adverse Effect had occurred or was imminent.   ARTICLE VII  
COVENANTS   7.1 Access to Information. Seller shall afford to Parent and
its accountants, counsel, financial advisors, environmental consultants and
other representatives, and to prospective lenders, placement agents and

and facilities (including all real property and the buildings, structures,
fixtures, appurtenances and improvements erected, attached or located

and, during such period, shall furnish promptly such information concerning

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be "Confidential
Information" for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement dated May 25, 2005
among Parent and Seller (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which
shall continue in force until the Closing; provided that Parent and Seller
may disclose such information as may be necessary in connection with seeking
necessary consents and approvals as contemplated hereby and in connection
with the Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be
required to disclose any information if such disclosure would contravene any
applicable Law. No information provided to or obtained by Parent pursuant to
this Section 7.1 shall limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to Parent (including, but not limited to, Parent\'s right to seek
indemnification pursuant to Article X), or the representations or warranties
of, or the conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereto.

Consents. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain at
the earliest practicable date all consents, waivers, approvals and notices
that are required to consummate, or in connection with, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as set forth on Company
Disclosure Schedule 7.3, including the consents, waivers, approvals and
notices referred to in Section 5.3(b) hereof (except for such matters covered
by Section 7.4, which are covered in that Section). All such consents,
waivers, approvals and notices shall be in writing and in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and executed counterparts of such
consents, waivers and approvals shall be delivered to Parent promptly after
receipt thereof, and copies of such notices shall be delivered to Parent
promptly after the making thereof.    60   7.4 Regulatory Approvals.  
(a) Each of Parent and Seller shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) make or cause to be made all filings
required of each of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and, in any
event, within ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement in the case
of all filings required under the HSR Act and within four weeks in the case
of all other filings required by other Antitrust Laws, (ii) comply at the
earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws for additional information, documents, or other materials
received by either of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "Antitrust
Division") or any other Governmental Body in respect of such filings or such
transactions, and (iii) cooperate with each other in connection with any such
filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable law, providing
copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to filing and
considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental
Body under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any such
transaction. Parent shall be responsible for all filing fees and expenses
associated with the required filings under the HSR Act; provided, however, in
the event of a second request by the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
Governmental Body in respect of such filings, all expenses incurred in
connection with responding to such requests shall be borne one-third by
Seller and two-thirds by Parent. Each such party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable law in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each such
party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto of any oral
communication with, and provide copies of written communications with,
any Governmental Body regarding any such filings or any such transaction and
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed communication by
such party to any Governmental Body. No party hereto shall independently
participate in any formal meeting with any Governmental Body in respect of
any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other
parties hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject
to applicable Law, the parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with the matters described in this Section 7.4,
including in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party hereto relating to proceedings under the HSR Act or
other Antitrust Laws.   (b) Each of Parent and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by
any Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton
Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other
Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the
"Antitrust    61  Laws"). In connection therewith, if any Legal
Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of any Antitrust
Law, Seller and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to contest
and resist any such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal, unless, by mutual agreement, Parent and Seller decide that
litigation is not in their respective best interests. Each of Parent and
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may
be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act
or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as
possible after the execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary provided herein, neither Parent or Seller nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall be required, in connection with the matters
covered by this Section 7.4, (i) to pay any amounts (other than the payment
of filing fees and expenses and fees of counsel), (ii) to commence litigation
(as opposed to defend litigation), (iii) to hold separate (including by trust
or otherwise) or divest any of its or its Affiliates\' businesses, product
lines or assets, or any of the Purchased Assets, (iv) to agree to
any limitation on the operation or conduct of the Business, or (v) to waive
any of the conditions to this Agreement set forth in Section 9.1.   7.5
Further Assurances. Subject to, and not in limitation of, Section 7.4, each
of Seller, Parent and Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary or appropriate
to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.   7.6 No Solicitation by
Seller; Etc.   (a) Seller shall, and shall cause its directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
agents and other representatives (collectively, "Representatives") to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the return from all such
Persons or cause the destruction of all copies of confidential information
previously provided to such parties by Seller or its Representatives. Seller
shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly
(i) solicit, initiate, cause, facilitate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing information) any inquiries or proposals that constitute, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding any Takeover
Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement related to any Takeover Proposal;
provided, however, that if after the date hereof the Board of Managers of
Seller receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal made
after the date hereof in circumstances not involving a breach of this
Agreement, and the Board of Managers of Seller reasonably determines in good
faith that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead
to a Superior Proposal, and with respect to which such Board determines in
good faith, after considering applicable provisions of state law and after
consulting with and receiving the advice of outside counsel,    62  that
the taking of such action is necessary in order for such Board to comply with
its fiduciary duties to Seller\'s unitholders under Iowa law, then
Seller may, at any time prior to obtaining the Seller Unitholder Approval
(but in no event after obtaining the Seller Unitholder Approval) and after
providing Parent not less than two Business Days written notice of its
intention to take such actions (A) furnish information with respect to Seller
to the Person making such Takeover Proposal, but only after such Person
enters into a customary confidentiality agreement with Seller (which
confidentiality agreement must be no less favorable to Seller (i.e., no less
restrictive with respect to the conduct of such Person) than the
Confidentiality Agreement), provided that (1) such confidentiality agreement
may not include any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate
with Seller and (2) Seller advises Parent of all such non-public information
delivered to such Person concurrently with its delivery to such Person and
concurrently with its delivery to such Person the Company delivers to Parent
all such information not previously provided to Parent, and (B) participate
in discussions and negotiations with such Person regarding such Takeover
Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation
of the foregoing restrictions by Seller\'s Representatives shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Section 7.6 by Seller. Seller shall provide Parent with a
correct and complete copy of any confidentiality agreement entered into
pursuant to this paragraph within 24 hours after the execution thereof.  
(b) In addition to the other obligations of Seller set forth in this Section
7.6, Seller shall promptly advise Parent orally, and within 24 hours advise
Parent in writing after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or
other contact is received by, any information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with,
Seller in respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to
Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with
such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of
such Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and
thereafter shall promptly keep Parent fully informed of all material
developments affecting the status and terms of any such proposals, offers,
inquiries or requests (and Seller shall provide Parent with copies of any
additional written materials received that relate to such proposals, offers,
inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.   (c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.6(c),
neither the Board of Managers of Seller nor any committee thereof shall
(i)(A) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the Seller Board Recommendation or the
approval or declaration of advisability by such Board of Managers of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or (B) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Seller
Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, or cause or authorize Seller to enter into,
any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding,
merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or other agreement
related to any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in
accordance with Section 7.6(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the   
63  Board of Managers of Seller may withdraw or modify the Seller
Board Recommendation, or recommend a Takeover Proposal, if such Board
determines in good faith that such Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal;
provided, however, that no Seller Adverse Recommendation Change may be made
in response to a Superior Proposal until after the fifth Business Day
following Parent\'s receipt of written notice (unless at the time such notice
is otherwise required to be given there are less than five Business Days
prior to the Seller Unitholders Meeting, in which case Seller shall provide
as much notice as is reasonably practicable) from Seller (a "Seller Adverse
Recommendation Notice") advising Parent that the Board of Managers of Seller
intends to make such Seller Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying the
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Seller Adverse Recommendation
Notice and a new five Business Day period (unless at the time such notice is
otherwise required to be given there are less than five Business Days prior
to the Seller Unitholders Meeting, in which case Seller shall provide as much
notice as is reasonably practicable)). In determining whether to make a
Seller Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal, the
Board of Managers of Seller shall take into account (i) any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent (in response to a Seller Adverse
Recommendation Notice or otherwise) and (ii) the amount of the Termination
Fee and Expenses payable to Parent hereunder in determining whether such
third party Takeover Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal.   (d)
For purposes of this Agreement:   "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry,
proposal or offer from any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act), other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any
(i) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions) of assets of Seller equal to 15% or more of
Seller\'s assets or to which 15% or more of Seller\'s revenues or earnings
are attributable, (ii) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions) of 15% or more of any class
of equity securities of Seller, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of
equity securities of Seller or (iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Seller; in each case, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide
written offer, obtained after the date hereof and not in breach of this
Agreement, to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting
of cash and/or securities, all of the equity securities of Seller or all or
substantially all of the assets of Seller, made by a third party, which is
otherwise on terms and conditions which the Board of Managers of Seller
determines in its good faith and reasonable judgment (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor) to be more favorable to Seller\'s
unitholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, taking into account at the time of determination any
changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been proposed
by Parent in writing and the ability of the Person making such proposal to
consummate the transactions contemplated by such proposal (based upon, among
other things, the availability of financing and the expectation of obtaining
required approvals).    64   7.7 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation;
Confidentiality.   (a) For a period from the Closing Date until the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall not, directly or indirectly,
own, manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or
partnership form or otherwise, engaged in the Business or that otherwise
competes with the Business (a "Restricted Business"). The parties hereto
specifically acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for any breach of
the foregoing will be inadequate and that Parent, in addition to any other
relief available to it, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damage or posting
any bond whatsoever.   (b) For a period from the Closing Date to the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall not: (i) cause, solicit, induce
or encourage any Employees of Seller to leave such employment or hire, employ
or otherwise engage any such individual; or (ii) cause, induce or encourage
any material actual or prospective client, customer, supplier or licensor of
the Business (including any existing or former customer of Seller and any
Person that becomes a client or customer of the Business after the Closing)
or any other Person who has a material business relationship with the
Business, to terminate or modify any such actual or prospective
relationship.   (c) From and after the date hereof, Seller shall not and
shall cause its Affiliates and their respective officers and directors not
to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any
Person other than authorized officers, directors and employees of Parent or
use or otherwise exploit for its own benefit or for the benefit of anyone
other than the Parent, any Confidential Information (as defined below).
Seller and its officers, directors and Affiliates shall not have any
obligation to keep confidential any Confidential Information if and to the
extent disclosure thereof is specifically required by law; provided, however,
that in the event disclosure is required by applicable Law, Seller shall, to
the extent reasonably possible, provide Parent with prompt notice of such
requirement prior to making any disclosure so that Parent may seek an
appropriate protective order. For purposes of this Section 7.7(c),
"Confidential Information" means any information with respect to
the Business, including methods of operation, customers, customer lists,
products, prices, fees, costs, Technology, inventions, Trade Secrets, know-
how, Software, marketing methods, plans, personnel, suppliers, competitors,
markets or other specialized information or proprietary matters. Confidential
Information does not include, and there shall be no obligation hereunder with
respect to, information that (i) is generally available to the public on the
date of this Agreement or (ii) becomes generally available to the public
other than as a result of a disclosure not otherwise permissible
hereunder.    65   (d) The covenants and undertakings contained in this
Section 7.7 relate to matters which are of a special, unique and
extraordinary character and a violation of any of the terms of this Section
7.7 will cause irreparable injury to Parent, the amount of which will be
impossible to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately
compensated. Accordingly, the remedy at law for any breach of this Section
7.7 will be inadequate. Therefore, Parent will be entitled to an injunction,
restraining order or other equitable relief from any court of competent
jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this Section 7.7 without the
necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond whatsoever. The
rights and remedies provided by this Section 7.7 are cumulative and in
addition to any other rights and remedies which Parent may have hereunder or
at law or in equity. In the event that Parent were to seek damages for
any breach of this Section 7.7, the portion of the Purchase Price which is
allocated by the parties to the foregoing covenant shall not be considered a
measure of or limit on such damages.   (e) The parties hereto agree that,
if any court of competent jurisdiction in a final nonappealable judgment
determines that a specified time period, a specified geographical area, a
specified business limitation or any other relevant feature of this Section
7.7 is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time
period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature
which is determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not
against public policy may be enforced against the applicable party.   7.8
Preservation of Records. Parent agrees that it shall preserve and keep the
records held by it or its Affiliates relating to the Business for a period
equal to the same period as it determines to be prudent for its own records
of a similar type, but in no event less than the applicable statutes
of limitation for federal and state income tax purposes with respect to tax
records used or useful for tax and accounting purposes, and shall make such
records and personnel available to Seller or its members as may be reasonably
required by Seller or its members in connection with, among other things,
preparation and filing of tax returns and related matters, any insurance
claims by, legal proceedings against or governmental investigations of Seller
or any of its Affiliates or members or in order to enable Seller to comply
with its obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement, document
or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby. In the event Parent wishes to
destroy (or permit to be destroyed) such records after that time, Parent
shall first give ninety days prior written notice to Seller and Seller shall
have the right at its option and expense, upon prior written notice given to
Parent within that ninety-day period, to take possession of the records
within 180 days after the date of such notice.   7.9 Publicity. Neither
Seller, Parent nor Purchaser shall issue any press release or public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other party
hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless,
in the sole judgment of Parent or Seller, as applicable, disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock
exchange on which Parent or Seller lists securities; provided that, to the
extent required by applicable Law, the party intending to make such
release shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such
applicable Law to consult with the other party with respect to the timing and
content thereof.    66   7.10 Use of Name. Seller hereby agrees that
upon the Closing, Purchaser shall have the sole right to the use of the name
"National By-Products" or similar names, and any service marks, trademarks,
trade names, d/b/a names, fictitious names, identifying symbols, logos,
emblems or signs containing or comprising the foregoing, or otherwise used in
the Business, including any name or mark confusingly similar thereto
(collectively, the "Seller Marks") and Seller shall not, and shall not permit
any Affiliate to, use such name or any variation or simulation thereof. After
closing, Seller shall promptly amend its charter to change its name to be in
compliance with this covenant.   7.11 Environmental Matters.   (a) Seller
shall permit Parent and Parent\'s environmental consultant to conduct such
investigations (including investigations known as "Phase I" environmental
Site Assessments and, only if mutually agreed to by Seller and Parent, "Phase
II environmental Site Assessments) of the environmental conditions of any
real property owned, operated or leased by or for Seller and the operations
thereat (subject to any limitations contained in valid, previously executed
leases) as Parent, in its reasonable discretion, shall deem necessary or
prudent ("Parent\'s Environmental Assessment"). Parent\'s Environmental
Assessment shall be conducted by a qualified environmental consulting firm,
possessing reasonable levels of insurance, in compliance with applicable Laws
and in a manner that minimizes the disruption of the operations of
Seller.   (b) Parent shall permit Seller and Seller\'s environmental
consultant to conduct such investigations (including investigations known as
"Phase I" environmental Site Assessments and, only if mutually agreed to by
Seller and Parent, "Phase II environmental Site Assessments) of the
environmental conditions of any real property owned, operated or leased by or
for Parent and the operations thereat (subject to any limitations contained
in valid, previously executed leases) as Seller, in its reasonable
discretion, shall deem necessary or prudent ("Seller\'s Environmental
Assessment"). Seller\'s Environmental Assessment shall be conducted by a
qualified environmental consulting firm, possessing reasonable levels of
insurance, in compliance with applicable Laws and in a manner that minimizes
the disruption of the operations of Parent.   (c) Seller shall promptly
file all materials required by Environmental Laws as a result of or in
furtherance of the transactions contemplated hereunder, including, but not
limited to any notifications or approvals required under environmental
property transfer laws such as the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act,
N.J. Stat. Ann. ss. 13:1K-6 et seq., or the Connecticut Property Transfer
Act, Gen. Stat. Ann. ss. 22a-134, and all requests required or necessary for
the transfer or re-issuance of Environmental Permits required to conduct the
Business after the Closing Date. Parent shall cooperate in all reasonable
respects with Seller with respect to such filings and Environmental permit
activities.   7.12 Cooperation with Financing. In order to assist with
obtaining the Financing (as defined in Section 9.1(q) below), Seller shall
provide such assistance and cooperation as Parent and its Affiliates may
reasonably request, including (a) making senior management of Seller
reasonably available for customary syndication presentations and meetings and
presentations with rating agencies and lenders or other proposed financing
sources and (b) cooperating with prospective lenders or other proposed
financing sources in performing their due diligence.    67   7.13
Monthly Financial Statements. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no
event later than 30 days after the end of each calendar month during the
period from the date hereof to the Closing, Seller shall provide Parent
with (a) unaudited monthly financial statements (such statements to be
prepared by Seller in accordance with GAAP consistent with past practice in
each case without footnotes) and (b) operating or management reports (such
reports to be in the form prepared by Seller in the Ordinary Course of
Business) of Seller for such preceding month (such financial statements, the
"Monthly Financial Statements").   7.14 Notification of Certain Matters.
Seller shall give notice to Parent and Parent shall give notice to Seller, as
promptly as reasonably practicable upon becoming aware of (a) any fact,
change, condition, circumstance, event, occurrence or non-occurrence that has
caused or is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty in
this Agreement made by it to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect at any
time after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, (b) any material failure
on its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder or (c) the institution of or
the threat of institution of any Legal Proceeding against Seller related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.14 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice, or the representations or warranties of, or the conditions to the
obligations of, the parties hereto.   7.15 Parent Board of Directors. On the
Closing Date, Parent shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to
elect Dean Carlson and one other nominee of Seller, acceptable to Parent, to
Parent\'s Board of Directors, to serve until Parent\'s next annual meeting of
stockholders and until his successor is elected and qualified, or if earlier,
until his earlier death, resignation or removal.   7.16 Preparation of the
Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement; Stockholder Meetings.   (a) As soon
as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Seller and Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement and Seller and Parent
shall prepare and Parent shall file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the
Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Seller and
Parent shall, and shall cause their accountants and lawyers to use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and keep the
Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including causing their
accountants to deliver necessary or required instruments such as opinions,
consents, certificates and comfort letters, each in customary form and
covering such matters of the type customarily covered by such documents.
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the unitholders of Seller and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy    68  Statement to be
mailed or otherwise delivered in accordance with Law to the stockholders of
Parent, in each case as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take
any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which
it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of process)
required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection
with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock, and Seller shall furnish
all information concerning Seller and the Unitholders of Seller as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any such action. No filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and
no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement will
be made by Seller or Parent, in each case without providing the other party a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to
the time the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act any
information relating to Seller or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by Seller or Parent
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
unitholders of Seller and the stockholders of Parent. The parties shall
notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the
staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of (i) all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Joint
Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the Form S-4.  
(b) Seller shall, as soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a special meeting of its unitholders (the "Seller
Unitholders Meeting") solely for the purpose of obtaining the Seller
Unitholder Approval. Subject to Section 7.6(c) hereof, Seller shall, through
its Board of Managers, recommend to its unitholders adoption of this
Agreement (the "Seller Board Recommendation"). The Joint Proxy Statement
shall include a copy of the Seller Board Recommendation. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Seller\'s obligations pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 7.16(b) shall not be affected by (i) the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Seller
of any Takeover Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Board
of Managers of Seller or any committee thereof of the Seller Board
Recommendation or such Board of Managers\' or such committee\'s approval of
this Agreement. Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Seller Unitholders Meeting to occur on the same date as the
Parent Stockholders Meeting.    69   (c) Parent shall, as soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, establish a record date
for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the "Parent Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining
the Parent Stockholder Approval. Parent shall, through its Board of
Directors, recommend to its stockholders that they vote in favor of
the Transaction and this Agreement; provided, however, that the Board of
Directors of Parent may withdraw or modify such recommendation if they
determine that such withdrawal or modification is necessary in the exercise
of their fiduciary duties; provided, further, however, that if the Board of
Directors of Parent withdraws or modifies such recommendation due to any
reason other than a reason or reasons arising from a Material Adverse Effect,
Parent shall pay Seller a Termination Fee and Expenses to the same extent as
provided for Parent in Section 4.5. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Parent Stockholders Meeting to occur on the same date as
the Seller Unitholders Meeting.   (d) Parent and Seller hereby agree that
any Unitholder of Seller that, prior to the True-Up Date, transfers his, her
or its shares of Parent Common Stock received at Closing (and any transferee
thereof except transfers by gift or into trust) shall be prohibited from
receiving any True-Up Shares as to the shares transferred. Certificates
evidencing shares of the Closing Issued Shares shall include a legend to that
effect.   7.17 Dividends. All cash dividends made by Seller to its
Unitholders after the date hereof and prior to Closing shall be made in the
Ordinary Course of Business; provided, however, that, on the Closing Date,
the amount of Closing Working Capital must be equal to at least the amount of
Target Working Capital; provided, further, however, that to the extent Seller
has cash on hand at Closing in excess of the amount required, if any, for
Closing Working Capital to equal at least the amount of Target Working
Capital, then Seller may make a special dividend of all such excess cash to
its unitholders immediately prior to Closing.   7.18 Amendment of Rights
Plan. Seller has amended its Rights Agreement, dated as of January 1, 1999,
to provide that such Rights Agreement shall terminate immediately prior to
the Closing.   7.19 No Dissolution of Seller. Seller hereby agrees that (a)
no action shall be taken to dissolve Seller or otherwise terminate its
limited liability company existence and (b) it will withhold sufficient funds
to meet its obligations under this Agreement, until the later to occur of the
date that is fifteen months following the Closing Date and the date upon
which all Unresolved Claims, if any, have been resolved in accordance with
Article X and the Escrow Agreement.   7.20 Transfer of Certificates of
Title. At Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser certificates of title to
the assets listed on Company Disclosure Schedule 7.20 to be transferred to
Purchaser.   7.21 Agreements of Rule 145 Affiliates. At least five Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to Parent a list identifying all persons who it believes may be
deemed to be "affiliates" of Seller, as that term is used in paragraphs (c)
and (d) of Rule    70  145 under the Securities Act (the "Rule 145
Affiliates"). Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each person who is identified as its Rule 145 Affiliate in such list to
deliver to Parent, at or prior to the Closing Date, a written agreement, in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B. Parent shall be entitled
to place restrictive legends on any shares of Parent Common Stock issued (i)
to such Rule 145 Affiliates and (ii) to any other Persons who it reasonably
believes may be deemed to be "affiliates" of Seller, as that term is used in
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, pursuant to the
Transaction.   7.22 Updating of Schedules. From time to time prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall promptly amend or supplement the Company
Disclosure Schedule to reflect any events or circumstances that occur or
arise between the date hereof and the Closing Date and that, if existing or
occurring on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be
disclosed on such Schedule in order to make the representations and
warranties of Seller true and correct; provided, however, that no such
amendment or supplement made by Seller shall have any effect for the purpose
of determining the satisfaction of the conditions to the obligations of
Parent and Purchaser hereunder or excuse the breach of a covenant of Seller
hereunder; and provided further, however, that following receipt of the
amended or supplemented Company Disclosure Schedule, Parent shall have the
option of either (a) terminating this Agreement or (b) proceeding with the
Closing and waiving any claim for indemnification for the additional
matter(s) so disclosed.   7.23 Engagement of Actuary. Seller shall use its
insurance company\'s actuary to value, at Seller\'s expense, Seller\'s
Liabilities related to potential workers\' compensation claims for Seller\'s
fiscal year ending 2005. Prior to Closing, Parent shall engage a reputable
third-party actuary, at Parent\'s expense, to value such Liabilities and the
difference, if any, between the amount determined by Seller\'s actuary and
the actuary engaged by Parent shall be reflected in the Final Working
Capital; provided that if the actuary engaged by Parent determines a range of
such Liabilities, the parties will use the mid-point amount and not the high-
or low-end of such range.   ARTICLE VIII   EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE
BENEFITS   8.1 Employment. Purchaser shall assume all liabilities arising
out of, relating to, or with respect to, the Labor Contracts with labor
unions or associations representing Employees of Seller disclosed in Company
Disclosure Schedule 5.14(b), and the Employees covered by the Labor Contracts
shall become employees of Purchaser after the Closing without interruption in
employment. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver, in writing, an
offer of employment on an "at will" basis to the Employees of Seller who are
not covered by any of the Labor Contracts disclosed in Company Disclosure
Schedule 5.14(a). Each such offer of employment shall be at the same salary
or hourly wage rate and position in effect immediately prior to the Closing
Date. The Employees of Seller covered by the Labor Contracts disclosed in
Company Disclosure Schedule 5.14(a) and the individuals who accept
Purchaser\'s "at will" employment offer by    71  the Closing Date are
hereinafter referred to as the "Transferred Employees." Subject to applicable
Laws and to any terms, conditions, or limitations contained in the Labor
Contracts disclosed in Company Disclosure Schedule 5.14(a), after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall have the right to dismiss any or all Transferred
Employees at any time, with or without cause, and to change the terms and
conditions of their employment (including compensation and employee benefits
provided to them).   8.2 Standard Procedure. Pursuant to Section 4 of
Revenue Procedure 2004-53 I.R.B. 2004-34, (a) Purchaser and Seller shall
report on a predecessor/successor basis as set forth therein, (b) Seller will
not be relieved from filing a Form W-2 with respect to any Transferred
Employees, and (c) Purchaser will undertake to file (or cause to be filed) a
Form W-2 for each such Transferred Employee only with respect to the portion
of the year during which such Employees are employed by the Purchaser that
includes the Closing Date, excluding the portion of such year that such
Employee was employed by Seller.   8.3 Employee Benefits. Following the
Closing, Purchaser shall provide the Transferred Employees who are not
covered by a collective bargaining agreement with benefits under Purchaser\'s
existing employee benefit plans or employee benefit plans of Seller that are
assumed by Purchaser ("Purchaser Plans") that are comparable, in the
aggregate, to the benefits provided by Seller immediately prior to the
Closing. Transferred Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining
agreement shall be provided with benefits in compliance with such agreement.
Purchaser shall cause Transferred Employees to be credited with service with
Seller for vesting and eligibility (including any earned vacation time to the
extent reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet) under the Purchaser
Plans and solely under Seller\'s defined benefit plan for benefit accruals
with respect to accrued benefit obligations. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
requiring any compensation or employee benefit plans, programs
or arrangements to continue to be maintained by Purchaser with respect to
the Transferred Employees for any specified period after the Closing
Date.   8.4 Withdrawal Liability.   (a) To avoid the imposition of
withdrawal liability on Seller, Parent and Purchaser agree that, with respect
to the Multiemployer Plans set forth on Company Disclosure Schedule 5.13(a)
to which Seller contributes (each, a "Plan"), they will: (i) contribute to
each Plan for substantially the same number of contribution base units (as
defined in ERISA Section 4001(a)(11)) for which Seller has an obligation to
contribute prior to the Closing Date with respect to the applicable
collective bargaining agreement and (ii) provide to each Plan for a period of
five consecutive plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning
after the Closing Date, a bond to be obtained by Purchaser issued by a
corporate surety corporation that is an acceptable surety for purposes of
ERISA Section 412, or a sum to be provided by Purchaser held in escrow by a
bank or similar financial institution, or an irrevocable letter of credit to
be obtained by Purchaser, equal to the greater of (x) the average annual
contribution required to be made by Seller with respect to the
operations    72  under the Plans for the three plan years immediately
preceding the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs or (y) the annual
contribution that Seller was required to make under each Plan with respect to
the operations for the last plan year prior to the plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs, or shall obtain a waiver of the requirements to provide
any of the foregoing or shall comply with alternatives acceptable to the Plan
or Plans, in order to ensure compliance with Section 4204 of ERISA. Unless
and until such a waiver of the bonding, escrow, or letter of credit
requirements is granted, or alternatives acceptable to the Plan or Plans are
satisfied, Parent and Purchaser shall comply with the bond, escrow or letter
of credit requirements, except to the extent provided in PBGC Regulation
4204(11)(d). If at any time during the first five plan years beginning after
the Closing Date, Purchaser withdraws from, or fails to make a required
contribution to, one of the Plans, the bond, escrow, or letter of credit
obtained with respect to such Plan, if any, shall be paid to such Plan. In
addition, if Seller is required to provide a bond or an amount in escrow
pursuant to ERISA Section 4204(a)(3), Parent and Purchaser, on behalf
of Seller, shall provide such bond or such amount in escrow, the costs of
which shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller, for the period of time,
and in a form that complies with ERISA Section 4204(a)(3) (or obtain a
variance from such bonding or escrow requirements from the Plan) and furnish
proof of such compliance to Seller.   (b) Secondary Liability. If Purchaser
effects a complete or partial withdrawal from a Plan during the first five
plan years following the Closing Date and Purchaser fails to make any
withdrawal liability payment to the Plan when due, then Seller shall be
secondarily liable to the Plan for any unpaid withdrawal liability to the
extent that Seller would have incurred such liability following the Closing
Date had Purchaser not agreed to the provisions of this Section 8.4.
Seller\'s obligations set forth in this Section 8.4(b) shall continue with
respect to events that occurred prior to the last day of the five plan year
period referred to in this Section 8.4 (regardless of when notice of such
liability is received by either Purchaser or Seller). Purchaser and
Seller shall promptly notify the other party of any demand for payment of
withdrawal liability received by Purchaser or Seller with respect to events
that occurred within five (5) years following the Closing Date. Purchaser and
Seller agree to take all such further actions as may be necessary to satisfy
the sale of assets exception requirements set forth in Section 4204 of ERISA.
If Seller incurs secondary liability under this Section 8.4, Parent and
Purchaser shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless Seller for any
such payments made by Seller in satisfaction of such obligation.   ARTICLE

of Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the
parties contained in this Agreement, any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto or any Seller Document or Purchaser Document shall survive the Closing
through and including the True-Up Date; provided, however, that the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section 5.8 (taxes)
shall survive the Closing until ninety days following the expiration of tha
applicable statute of limitations with respect to the particular
matter thereof (in each case, the the "Survival Period"); provided, however,
that any obligations under Sections 10.2(a)(i) and 10.2(b)(i) shall not
terminate with respect to any Losses as to which the Person to be indemnified
shall have given notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of the claim
for indemnification) to the indemnifying party in accordance with Section
10.3(a) before the termination of the Survival Period.    78   10.2
Indemnification.   (a) Subject to Sections 10.1, 10.4 and 10.5 hereof,
Seller hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Parent and its Affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, members,
partners, agents, attorneys, representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Parent Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against,
and pay to the applicable Parent Indemnified Parties the amount of, any and
all losses, liabilities, claims, obligations, deficiencies, demands,
judgments, damages (including incidental and consequential damages),
interest, fines, penalties, claims, suits, actions, causes of action,
assessments, awards, costs and expenses (including reasonable costs of
investigation and defense and attorneys\' and other professionals\' fees and
related charges), or any diminution in value, whether or not involving a
third party claim (individually, a "Loss" and, collectively, "Losses"):  
(i) based upon, attributable to or resulting from the failure of  any of the
representations or warranties made by Seller in this  Agreement or in any
Seller Document to be true and correct in all  respects at and as of the date
hereof and at and as of the Closing  Date;   (ii) based upon, attributable
to or resulting from the breach of  any covenant or other agreement on the
part of Seller under this  Agreement or in any Seller Document;   (iii) any
Liability of Seller under WARN arising on or before the  Closing Date;
and   (iv) arising out of, based upon or relating to any Excluded Asset  or
any Excluded Liability.   (b) Subject to Sections 10.1 and 10.4, Parent and
Purchaser hereby agree to indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates and
their respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Unitholders,
partners, agents, attorneys, representatives, successors and permitted
assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless from and
against, and pay to the applicable Seller Indemnified Parties the amount of,
any and all Losses:   (i) based upon, attributable to or resulting from the
failure of  any of the representations or warranties made by Parent or
Purchaser  in this Agreement or in any Purchaser Document to be true and
correct  in all respects at the date hereof and as of the Closing Date;  
(ii) based upon, attributable to or resulting from the breach of  any
covenant or other agreement on the part of Parent or Purchaser  under this
Agreement or any Purchaser Document; and   (iii) arising out of, based upon
or relating to any Assumed  Liability.    79  For greater clarity and
subject to the limitations contained in this Article X, Losses can be
recovered on behalf of the Unitholders by Seller.   (c) The right to
indemnification or any other remedy based on representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement, any Seller Document or Purchaser
Document shall not be affected by any investigation conducted at any time, or
any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether
before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing
Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The waiver of any
condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any such covenant or agreements, will not
affect the right to indemnification or any other remedy based on
such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements.   10.3
Indemnification Procedures.   (a) A claim for indemnification for any matter
not involving a third party claim shall be asserted by prompt written notice
to the party from whom indemnification is sought; provided, however, that
failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not preclude the
indemnified party from any indemnification which it may claim in accordance
with this Article X unless the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by
the failure to give prompt written notice of the claim for
indemnification.   (b) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be
instituted or that any claim or demand shall be asserted by any third party
in respect of which indemnification may be sought under Section 10.2 hereof
(regardless of the limitations set forth in Section 10.4) ("Third Party
Claim"), the indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice of the
assertion of any Third Party Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered
by this indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The failure of
the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Third Party
Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying party\'s
obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the indemnifying
party can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result of such failure.
Subject to the provisions of this Section 10.3, the indemnifying party shall
have the right, at its sole expense, to be represented by counsel of its
choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and
to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party
Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against by it hereunder;
provided that the indemnifying party shall have acknowledged in writing to
the indemnified party its unqualified obligation to indemnify the indemnified
party as provided hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which
relates to any Losses indemnified against by it hereunder, it shall
within ten (10) days of the indemnified party\'s written notice of the
assertion of such Third Party Claim (or sooner, if the nature of the Third
Party Claim so requires) notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so;
provided that the indemnifying party must conduct its defense of the Third
Party Claim actively    80  and diligently thereafter in order to
preserve its rights in this regard. If the indemnifying party elects not to
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party
Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against by it hereunder, fails
to notify the indemnified party of its election as herein provided or
contests its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party for such Losses
under this Agreement, the indemnified party may defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim. If the indemnified
party defends any Third Party Claim, then the indemnifying party shall
reimburse the indemnified party for the expenses of defending such
Third Party Claim upon submission of periodic bills. If the indemnifying
party shall assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the indemnified
party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that such indemnified party shall be
entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the
expense of the indemnifying party if (i) so requested by the indemnifying
party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
indemnified party a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate
representation advisable; and provided, further, that the indemnifying party
shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel (plus any
appropriate local counsel) for all indemnified parties in connection with any
Third Party Claim. Each party hereto agrees to provide reasonable access to
each other party to such documents and information as may reasonably by
requested in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any
such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.3 to the
contrary, neither the indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall,
without the written consent of the other party, settle or compromise any
Third Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment
unless the claimant (or claimants) and such party provide to such other party
an unqualified release from all Liability in respect of the Third
Party Claim. If the indemnifying party makes any payment on any Third Party
Claim, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to all rights and remedies of the indemnified party to any insurance
benefits or other claims of the indemnified party with respect to such Third
Party Claim.   (c) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have
been rendered by a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the
expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall
have been consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party
shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement, in each case with respect
to an Third Party Claim hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the
indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and the indemnifying
party shall pay all of such remaining sums so due and owing to the
indemnified party in accordance with Section 10.5.   10.4 Limitations on
Indemnification for Breaches of Representations and Warranties.   (a) An
indemnifying party shall not have any Liability under Section 10.2(a)(i) or
Section 10.2(b)(i) hereof unless the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by
the indemnified parties and indemnifiable thereunder based upon, attributable
to or resulting from the failure of any of the representations or warranties
to be true and correct exceeds $1,400,000 (the "Basket") and, in such event,
the indemnifying party shall be required to pay the entire amount of all such
Losses.    81   (b) The liability of Seller, Parent, and Purchaser under
this Article X shall not exceed the Indemnity Escrow Amount.   (c) For
purposes of determining the failure of any representations or warranties to
be true and correct, the breach of any covenants or agreements, and
calculating Losses hereunder any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements shall be disregarded.   10.5 Tax Treatment of Indemnity
Payments. Seller and Parent agree to treat any indemnity payment made
pursuant to this Article X as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes. If, notwithstanding the treatment required by the preceding
sentence, any indemnification payment under Article X (including this Section
10.5) is determined to be taxable to the party receiving such payment by any
Taxing Authority, the paying party shall also indemnify the party receiving
such payment for any Taxes incurred by reason of the receipt of such payment
and any Losses incurred by the party receiving such payment in connection
with such Taxes (or any asserted deficiency, claim, demand, action, suit,
proceeding, judgment or assessment, including the defense or
settlement thereof, relating to such Taxes).   ARTICLE XI   TAXES  
11.1 Transfer Taxes. Seller and Parent shall each (i) be responsible for half
of any and all sales, use, stamp, documentary, filing, recording, transfer,
real estate transfer, stock transfer, gross receipts, registration, duty,
securities transactions or similar fees or taxes or governmental
charges (together with any interest or penalty, addition to tax or additional
amount imposed) as levied by any Taxing Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"),
regardless of the Person liable for such Transfer Taxes under applicable Law
and (ii) timely file or caused to be filed all necessary documents (including
all Tax Returns) with respect to Transfer Taxes.   11.2 Prorations. Seller
shall bear all property and ad valorem tax liability with respect to the
Purchased Assets if the lien or assessment date arises prior to the Closing
Date irrespective of the reporting and payment dates of such taxes. All other
real property taxes, personal property taxes, or ad valorem obligations and
similar recurring taxes and fees on the Purchased Assets for taxable periods
beginning before, and ending after, the Closing Date, shall be prorated
between Purchaser and Seller as of the Closing Date. Seller shall
be responsible for all such taxes and fees on the Purchased Assets accruing
during any period up to and including the Closing Date. Purchaser shall be
responsible for all such taxes and fees on the Purchased Assets accruing
during any period    82  after the Closing Date. With respect to Taxes
described in this Section 11.2, Seller shall prepare and timely file all Tax
Returns due before the Closing Date with respect to such Taxes and Purchaser
shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns due after the Closing Date with
respect to such Taxes. If one party remits to the appropriate Taxing
Authority payment for Taxes, which are subject to proration under this
Section 11.2 and such payment includes the other party\'s share of such
Taxes, such other party shall promptly reimburse the remitting party for its
share of such Taxes.   11.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Parent and Seller
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Purchased Assets
and the Assumed Liabilities as is reasonably necessary for the preparation
and filing of any Tax Return, claim for refund or other filings relating to
Tax matters, for the preparation for any Tax audit, for the preparation for
any Tax protest, for the prosecution or defense of any suit or other
proceeding relating to Tax matters.   ARTICLE XII   RISK OF LOSS   The
risk of loss, damage or destruction to the Purchased Assets from fire or
other casualty or cause, shall be borne by Seller at all times up to
the Closing. It shall be the responsibility of Seller prior to the Closing to
use reasonable commercial efforts to repair or cause to be repaired and to
restore the affected property to its condition prior to any such loss, damage
or destruction. In the event of any such loss, damage or destruction, the
proceeds of any claim for any loss payable under any insurance policy with
respect thereto shall be used to repair, replace or restore any such property
to its former condition subject to the conditions stated below. In the event
that property reasonably required for the normal operation of the Business is
not repaired, replaced, or restored prior to the Closing, Purchaser, at its
sole option, and as Purchaser\'s sole remedy with respect to any of the
foregoing, upon written notice to Seller: (a) may elect to postpone Closing
until such time as the property has been repaired, replaced, or restored, or
(b) may elect to consummate the Closing and accept the property in its then
condition, in which event Seller shall assign to Purchaser all proceeds of
insurance theretofore, or to be, received, covering the property involved;
and if Purchaser shall extend the time for Closing pursuant to clause (a)
above, and the repairs, replacements, or restorations are not completed
within sixty (60) days after the date on which all of the conditions set
forth in Article IX has been satisfied or waived (other than conditions by
their nature are to be satisfied at Closing), Purchaser may, as its sole
right and remedy, terminate this Agreement by giving written notice thereof
to Seller, without any party having any Liability or obligation under or in
respect of this Agreement.   ARTICLE XIII   MISCELLANEOUS   13.1
Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of Seller,
Parent and Purchaser shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other agreement,
document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Seller shall pay one-half the
costs of title insurance and surveys.    83   13.2 Specific Performance.
Seller agrees that the Purchased Assets include unique property that cannot
be readily obtained on the open market and that Parent and Purchaser will be
irreparably injured if the Closing under this Agreement does not occur as
provided herein. Therefore, Parent and Purchaser shall have the right
specifically to enforce the performance of Seller\'s obligations under this
Agreement to effect the Closing without the necessity of posting any bond or
other security, and Seller hereby waives the defense in any such suit that
Parent and Purchaser have an adequate remedy at law and agree not to
interpose any opposition, legal, or otherwise, as to the propriety
of specific performance as a remedy. If the Closing shall not occur in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the remedy of specific
enforcement in accordance with this Section 13.2 shall not be exclusive of
any other rights and remedies that Parent and Purchaser may otherwise have
under this Agreement, all of which rights and remedies shall be
cumulative.   13.3 Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process; Arbitration.   (a) The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court located within the
State of New York over any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and each party
hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or any
suit, action proceeding related thereto may be heard and determined in such
courts. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of
inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Any controversy, dispute or claim arising under or in connection with this
Agreement (including, without limitation, the existence, validity,
interpretation or breach hereof and any claim based on contract, tort of
statute) shall be resolved by a binding arbitration, to be held in Dallas,
Texas pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act and in accordance with the
then-prevailing International Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association (the "AAA"). The AAA shall select three arbitrators. Each party
shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with arbitration and the
fees and expenses of the arbitrators shall be shared equally by the parties
involved in the dispute and advanced by them from time to time as required.
It is the mutual intention and desire of the parties that the tribunal of
three arbitrators be constituted as expeditiously as possible following
the submission of the dispute to arbitration. Once such tribunal is
constituted and except as may otherwise be agreed in writing by the parties
involved in such dispute or as ordered by the arbitrators upon substantial
justification shown, the hearing for the dispute will be held within sixty
days of submission of the dispute to arbitration. The arbitrators shall
render their final award within    84  sixty days, subject to extension
by the arbitrators upon substantial justification shown of extraordinary
circumstances, following conclusion of the hearing and any required post-
hearing briefing or other proceedings ordered by the arbitrators. Any
discovery in connection with arbitration hereunder shall be limited to
information directly relevant to the controversy or claim in arbitration. The
arbitrators will state the factual and legal basis for the award in writing.
The decision of the arbitrators in any such proceeding will be final and
binding and not subject to judicial review and final judgment may be entered
upon such an award in any court of competent jurisdiction, but entry of such
judgment will not be required to make such award effective. Any
action against any party hereto ancillary to arbitration pursuant to this
Section 13.3(a) (as determined by the arbitrators), including any action for
provisional or conservatory measures or action to enforce an arbitration
award or any judgment entered by any court in respect of any thereof may be
brought in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located
within the State of New York, and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court located
within the State of New York over any such action.   (b) The parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such action brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for
the maintenance of such action. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
judgment in any such action may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.   (c) Each of the
parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any party to this
Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by the delivery of a copy thereof
in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.6.   13.4 Entire Agreement;
Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement and the exhibits hereto, the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, and the Confidentiality
Agreement represent the entire understanding and agreement between the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement can
be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived,
only by written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed
by the party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement,
including without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party,
shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of
compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver
of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure
on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.    85   13.5 Governing
Law. This Agreement and all matters based upon, arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws, both
procedural and substantive, of the State of New York without regard to its
conflict of laws provisions that if applied might require the application of
the laws of another jurisdiction.   13.6 Notices. All notices and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed
given (i) when delivered personally by hand (with written confirmation of
receipt), (ii) when sent by facsimile (with written confirmation of
transmission) or (iii) one Business Day following the day sent by overnight

provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being
enforced by any law or public policy, all other terms or provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially    86  adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the
greatest extent possible.   13.8 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall
create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any
person or entity not a party to this Agreement except as provided below. No
assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be
made by either Seller, Parent or Purchaser (by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any
attempted assignment without the required consents shall be void; provided,
however, that Parent and Purchaser may assign this Agreement and any or all

rights to purchase the Purchased Assets and assume the Assumed Liabilities
and Parent\'s and Purchaser\'s rights to seek indemnification hereunder) to
any Affiliate of Parent, any Person from which it has borrowed money or any
Person to which Parent or any of its Affiliates proposes to sell all or
substantially all of the assets relating to the Business. Upon any such
permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to Parent or
Purchaser, as applicable, shall also apply to any such assignee unless the
context otherwise requires.   13.9 Non-Recourse. No past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of Parent or its Affiliates

"ESCROW AGREEMENT"), is by and among Darling International Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("PARENT"), National By-Products, LLC, an Iowa limited liability
company ("SELLER" and together with Parent, sometimes referred to
collectively as the "PARTIES"), and U.S. Bank, National Association, as
escrow agent (the "ESCROW AGENT").   RECITALS   A. Pursuant to that
certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 19, 2005, by and among
Parent, Darling National LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("PURCHASER"), and Seller (the "PURCHASE
AGREEMENT"), Purchaser will acquire substantially all of Seller\'s assets.
The Escrow Agent is not a party to and will not be responsible for the
Purchase Agreement.   B. The Parties wish, pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement, to set aside in escrow a portion of the consideration to be
delivered by Parent pursuant to the Purchase Agreement to secure any purchase
price adjustments or indemnification obligations of Seller under the Purchase
Agreement.   C. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have
the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.  
AGREEMENT   Accordingly, in consideration of the recitals and of the
respective agreements and covenants contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the Parties and the Escrow Agent agree as follows:  
Section 1. DEPOSIT OF ESCROW FUNDS. On the Closing Date, Parent shall, on
behalf of Seller, deliver or caused to be delivered to the Escrow Agent
an amount in immediately available funds equal to THREE MILLION FIVE
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($3,500,000) (the "ESCROW CASH") and that number of
shares of Parent Common Stock rounded to the nearest whole number equal to
the quotient of SIX MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($6,500,000)
divided by the Closing Share Price (the "ESCROW SHARES"). The Escrow Cash,
together with interest and dividends earned thereon, is referred to as the
"CASH ESCROW FUNDS." As used herein, the term "ESCROW FUNDS" shall mean the
Cash Escrow Funds and the Escrow Shares, less any distributions made
hereunder. The Escrow Funds will be held in trust and will not be subject to
any lien or attachment of any creditor of any party hereto and will be used
solely for the purposes and subject to the conditions set forth herein. The
Cash Escrow Funds shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Shares shall be delivered to the    A-1  Escrow Agent by a bonded
carrier against receipt therefor by the Escrow Agent. All cash amounts
received as a distribution in respect of the Escrow Shares shall be deposited
under the terms of this Escrow Agreement, and shall become part of the Cash
Escrow Funds. All non-cash amounts received as a distribution in respect of
the Escrow Shares shall be deposited under the terms of this Escrow
Agreement, and shall be held with the Escrow Shares.   Section 2. ACCEPTANCE
OF APPOINTMENT AS ESCROW AGENT. The Escrow Agent, by executing this Escrow
Agreement, accepts the appointment as the Escrow Agent hereto and agrees (a)
to hold, invest, reinvest and distribute the Cash Escrow Funds and (b) to
hold and distribute the Escrow Shares, as applicable, in accordance with the
terms of this Escrow Agreement.   Section 3. INVESTMENTS.   (a) Permitted
Investments. Pending disbursement of the Cash Escrow Funds, the Escrow Agent
will invest the Cash Escrow Funds, including those cash amounts received as a
distribution in respect of the Escrow Shares, in Permitted Investments (as
hereinafter defined). For purposes of this Escrow Agreement, "PERMITTED
INVESTMENTS" means (i) money market funds registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, the portfolio of which is limited to the
investments described in clauses (ii) through (v) of this Section 3(a), (ii)
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency
thereof, either outright or in connection with repurchase agreements covering
such obligations, (iii) obligations of or guaranteed by any state
or political subdivision of the United States of America with a maturity of
six months or less, (iv) interest bearing certificates of deposit or
bankers\' acceptances issued by any national or state-chartered bank having
capital and surplus of at least $1,000,000,000 with an investment term of six
months or less, (v) commercial paper with a maturity of no more than 30 days
rated at least P-1 by Moody\'s Investor Service, Inc. and A-1 by Standard and
Poor\'s Corporation, (vi) a U.S. Bank Money Market Account and (vii) such
other investments as may be specified from time to time to the Escrow Agent
by joint written instructions of Parent and Seller.   (b) Conversion of
Investments. As and when any amount of the Cash Escrow Funds is needed for
disbursement under this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will cause a
sufficient amount of the Cash Escrow Funds to be converted into cash. Seller
will select the investments or types of investments to be so converted.
Neither Parent nor Seller will be liable for any loss of principal or income
due to the choice of Permitted Investments in which the Cash Escrow Funds are
invested or the Permitted Investments sold or converted pursuant to this
Section 3(b).   (c) TINs. Tax Matters. The Parties each represent that
its correct Taxpayer Identification Number assigned by the Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS") or any other taxing authority is set forth on the signature
page hereof. In addition, all interest or other income earned under this
Escrow Agreement shall be reported, allocated and/or paid to Seller and
treated as owned by Seller for all tax purposes, and such income shall be
reported to the IRS or any other taxing authority in a manner consistent
therewith. The Escrow Agent shall    A-2  withhold any taxes it deems
appropriate and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities. Any
tax returns or reports required to be prepared and filed on behalf of or by
the Escrow Funds will be prepared and filed by Seller, as applicable, and the
Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the preparation and/or filing
of any tax return with respect to any income earned by the Escrow Funds. In
addition, any tax or other payments (including penalties and interest
thereon) required to be made pursuant to such tax return or filing will be
paid by Seller, as appropriate. The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility
for such payment unless directed to do so by the appropriate authorized
party.   (d) Investments. During the term of this Escrow Agreement,
the Cash Escrow Funds shall be invested in the [U.S. Bank Money Market
Account](1), unless otherwise instructed in writing by the Parties and as
shall be acceptable to the Escrow Agent. Such written instructions, if any,
referred to in the foregoing sentence shall specify the type and identity of
the Permitted Investments to be purchased and/or sold. The Escrow Agent shall
have the right to liquidate any investments held in order to provide funds
necessary to make required payments under this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow
Agent shall have no liability for any loss sustained as a result of any
investment in an investment made pursuant to the terms of this contract or as
a result of any liquidation of any investment prior to its maturity or for
the failure of the Parties to give the Escrow Agent instructions to invest or
reinvest the Cash Escrow Funds. The Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates may
receive compensation with respect to any investment directed hereunder.
Receipt of the Escrow Funds and investment and reinvestment of the Cash
Escrow Funds shall be confirmed by the Escrow Agent as soon as practicable by
an account statement, and any discrepancies in any such account statement
shall be noted by the Parties to the Escrow Agent within 30 calendar days
after receipt thereof. Failure to inform the Escrow Agent in writing of any
discrepancies in any such account statement within such 30-day period shall
conclusively be deemed confirmation of such account statement in its
entirety.   Section 4. RELEASE OF ESCROW FUNDS DUE TO PURCHASE PRICE
ADJUSTMENT. Upon final determination of Final Working Capital pursuant to
Section 3.5 of the Purchase Agreement, if Initial Closing Working Capital
exceeds Final Working Capital, Seller and Parent shall promptly, but not
later than three Business Days after such final determination, execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent an instruction letter, substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (a "JOINT INSTRUCTION LETTER"), directing the
Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Funds to Parent an amount equal to
the difference between Initial Closing Working Capital and Final Working
Capital, together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date
payment is made as determined in accordance with Section 3.5(f) of the
Purchase Agreement (such amount, the "WORKING CAPITAL CLAIM"). Promptly
following the Escrow Agent\'s receipt of the executed Joint Instruction
Letter, the Escrow Agent shall release and distribute, in accordance with
such instructions, the number of Escrow Shares necessary to satisfy sixty-
five percent (65%) of the Working Capital Claim by a bonded
carrier   ---------------------------- (1) If not a U.S. Bank Money Market

the Escrow Agent.    A-3  against receipt therefor by Parent and thirty-
five percent (35%) of the Working Capital Claim out of the Cash Escrow Funds
by wire transfer thereof to the account designated by Parent. The number of
Escrow Shares to be released and distributed to Parent, if any, shall be
valued in accordance with Section 10 hereof.   Section 5. RELEASE OF ESCROW
FUNDS DUE TO INDEMNITY.   (a) After any final decision, judgment or award
shall have been rendered by a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and
the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement
shall have been consummated, or Seller and the applicable Parent Indemnified
Party shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to any
claim for indemnification under Section 10.2(a) of the Purchase Agreement
(each such resolved claim, a "FINAL CLAIM"), Parent shall deliver to Seller
(with a copy to the Escrow Agent) written notice of any sums due and owing by
Seller pursuant to the Purchase Agreement with respect to such matter,
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (a "FINAL CLAIM
NOTICE"), and the Escrow Agent shall promptly release and distribute to
Parent the number of Escrow Shares necessary to satisfy sixty-five percent
(65%) of such Final Claim by a bonded carrier against receipt therefor by
Parent and an amount in cash out of the Cash Escrow Funds sufficient to
satisfy thirty-five percent (35%) such Final Claim by wire transfer thereof
to the account designated by Parent. The number of Escrow Shares to be
released and distributed to Parent, if any, shall be valued in accordance
with Section 10 hereof.   (b) Any portion of the Escrow Funds identified and
held beyond the applicable release date under Section 6 hereof will continue
to be held by the Escrow Agent available to satisfy, in accordance with
Section 5(a), any claims for indemnification under Section 10.2(a) of the
Purchase Agreement asserted, but not yet resolved, prior to the applicable
release date described in Section 6 hereof ("UNRESOLVED CLAIMS"). After any
Unresolved Claim is fully resolved in accordance with Section 10.3(c) of the
Purchase Agreement and Section 5(a) hereof and any Final Claim in respect
thereof has been paid in full, Parent and Seller shall promptly, but not
later than five Business Days after such final resolution and payment,
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Instruction Letter directing
the Escrow Agent to release any remaining Escrow Funds to Seller that have
been retained as Escrow Funds for such Unresolved Claim under Section 6
hereof, which shall be released in the same proportion of Cash Escrow Funds
and Escrow Shares as provided in Section 6 hereof. Promptly following the
Escrow Agent\'s receipt of such Joint Instruction Letter, the Escrow Agent
shall release and distribute any remaining Escrow Funds to Seller that have
been retained as Escrow Funds for such Unresolved Claim under Section 6
hereof, which shall be released in the same proportion of Cash Escrow Funds
and Escrow Shares as provided in Section 6 hereof. The Cash Escrow Funds to
be released pursuant to this Section 5(b), if any, shall be delivered by wire
transfer thereof to the account designated by Seller and the Escrow Shares to
be released pursuant to this Section 5(b), if any, shall be delivered by a
bonded carrier against receipt therefor by Seller.    A-4   Section 6.

DOLLARS ($1,050,000) in immediately available funds out of the Cash Escrow
Funds (plus interest and dividends earned thereon), less (ii)
any distributions made to Parent hereunder following the First Release Date

shall continue to be retained until released in accordance with Sections 5(a)
and 5(b).   (d) On or before each of the First Release Date, the
Second Release Date and the Final Release Date, Parent shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent written notice of any Unresolved Claims, substantially in the

Section 8. DIVIDENDS, ETC. Any cash, securities or other
property distributable (whether by way of dividend, stock split or otherwise)
in respect of or in exchange for any of the Escrow Shares shall not be
immediately distributed to Seller, but rather shall be held by the Escrow
Agent as a part of the Escrow Funds. At the time any of the Escrow Shares are
required to be    A-5  released from the Escrow Funds to either of the
Parties pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, any cash, securities or other
property previously distributed in respect of or in exchange for such Escrow
Shares shall be released from the Escrow Funds to such Party.   Section 9.
FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
retained in or released from the Escrow Funds pursuant to this Escrow

American Stock Exchange (as reported by The Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition, or if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source) for the
five consecutive trading days that end on the trading day prior to the date
payment is made. The Release Date Share Price shall be used for determining
the value of Escrow Shares under Section 4 and Section 5 hereof.   Section
11. RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ESCROW AGENT.   (a) Duties. The
Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set
forth herein and no duties shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall have no
liability under and no duty to inquire as to the provisions of any agreement
other than this Escrow Agreement (other than (i) the definitions of
capitalized terms that are defined in the Purchase Agreement and not
otherwise defined herein and (ii) to the extent specific reference is made in
this Escrow Agreement to particular provisions of the Purchase
Agreement). The Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable for acting
or refraining from acting upon any written notice, document, instruction or
request furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow
Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity,
accuracy or content of any such document, notice, instruction or request. The
Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments that may be due it or
the Escrow Funds. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken
or omitted by it in good faith except to the extent that a final adjudication
of a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Escrow Agent\'s
gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith was the primary cause of
any loss to either of the Parties. The Escrow Agent may execute any of its
powers and perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through agents or
attorneys (and shall be liable only for the careful selection of any such
agent or attorney) and may consult with counsel, accountants and other
skilled persons to be selected and retained by it. The Escrow Agent shall not
be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel, accountants or
other skilled persons. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain
as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or
demands from any party hereto that, in its opinion, conflict with any of the
provisions of this Escrow Agreement, it shall be    A-6  entitled to
refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep
safely all property held in escrow until it shall be directed otherwise
in writing by all of the other parties hereto or by a final order or judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Escrow Agent may interplead all of
the assets held hereunder into a court of competent jurisdiction or may seek
a declaratory judgment with respect to certain circumstances, and thereafter
be fully relieved from any and all liability or obligation with respect to
such interpleaded assets or any action or non action based on such
declaratory judgment. Anything in this Escrow Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special,
indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including,
but not limited to, lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised
of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of
action. No party to this Escrow Agreement is liable to any other party for
losses due to, or if it is unable to perform its obligations under the terms
of this Escrow Agreement because of, acts of God, fire, war, terrorism,
floods, strikes, electrical outages, equipment or transmission failure, or
other causes reasonably beyond its control.   (b) Reliance on Orders. If
any Escrow Funds are at any time attached, garnished or levied upon under any
court order or in case the release of any such Escrow Funds is stayed or
enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment or decree is made
or entered by any court affecting such Escrow Funds or any part thereof, then
and in any of such events, the Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole
discretion, to rely upon and comply with any such order, writ, judgment or
decree that it is advised by legal counsel is binding upon it. If the Escrow
Agent complies with any such order, writ, judgment or decree, it will not be
liable to any of the Parties or to any other person by reason of such
compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or decree may be
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.   (c)
Liability. The Escrow Agent will not be liable for any act taken or omitted
under this Escrow Agreement if taken or omitted by it in good faith except to
the extent that a final adjudication of a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that the Escrow Agent\'s gross negligence, willful misconduct or
bad faith was the primary cause of any loss to either of the Parties. The
Escrow Agent will also be fully protected in relying upon any written notice,
demand, certificate or document that it in good faith believes to be genuine
(including facsimiles thereof).   (d) Resignation. The Escrow Agent, and any
successor escrow agent, may resign at any time as the Escrow Agent hereunder
by giving at least 30 days written notice to Parent and Seller. Upon such
resignation and the appointment of a successor escrow agent, the resigning
Escrow Agent will be absolved from any and all liability in connection with
the exercise of its powers and duties as the Escrow Agent hereunder except
for liability arising in connection with its gross negligence, willful
misconduct or bad faith. Upon their receipt of notice of resignation from the
Escrow Agent, Parent and Seller will use reasonable efforts jointly to
designate a successor escrow agent. In the event Parent and Seller do not
agree upon a successor escrow agent within 30 days after the receipt of such
notice, the Escrow Agent so resigning may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or other
appropriate relief and any such resulting appointment will    A-7  be
binding upon all of the Parties. By mutual agreement, Parent and Seller
will have the right at any time upon not less than 10 days written notice to
the Escrow Agent to terminate their appointment of the Escrow Agent, or
successor escrow agent, as the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent or successor
escrow agent will continue to act as Escrow Agent until a successor is
appointed and qualified to act as the Escrow Agent.   (e) Conflicting
Demands. In the event conflicting demands are made or conflicting notices are
served upon the Escrow Agent that are directly related to its duties under
this Escrow Agreement, the parties hereto agree that the Escrow Agent will
take no action until (i) such action is agreed to in writing by the Parties
or (ii) the issuance of a court order by a court of competent jurisdiction
directing the Escrow Agent with respect to the action that is the subject of
the conflicting demands or notices.   (f) Indemnification. Parent and Seller
hereby agree, severally but not jointly, to indemnify the Escrow Agent for,
and to hold the Escrow Agent harmless against, any loss, liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the
part of the Escrow Agent, arising out of or in connection with the Escrow
Agent\'s entering into this Escrow Agreement and carrying out the Escrow
Agent\'s duties hereunder, including costs and expenses of successfully
defending the Escrow Agent against any claim of liability with respect
thereto. One-half of any payment made pursuant to this Section 11(f) will be
paid by Parent and one-half will be paid by Seller. The Escrow Agent may
consult with counsel of its own choice and will have full and complete
authorization and protection for any action taken or suffered by it hereunder
in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of such counsel.   (g) Fees
and Expenses of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent will (i) be paid a fee for its
services under this Escrow Agreement as provided by Exhibit D and (ii) be
entitled to reimbursement for reasonable expenses (including the reasonable
fees and disbursements of its counsel) actually incurred by the Escrow Agent
in connection with its duties under this Escrow Agreement (such fees and
expenses being hereinafter referred to collectively as the "ESCROW AGENT FEES
AND EXPENSES"). All Escrow Agent Fees and Expenses will be shared equally by
Parent and by Seller.   Section 12. MISCELLANEOUS.   (a) Notices. All

Amendment and Waivers. This Escrow Agreement can be amended, supplemented or
changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument
making specific reference to this Escrow Agreement signed by the party
against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or
waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Escrow
Agreement, including without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of
any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such
action of compliance with any covenant or agreement contained herein. The
waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Escrow
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver
of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure
on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.   (d) Governing Law. This
Escrow Agreement and all matters based upon, arising out of or related to

deemed to be an original copy of this Escrow Agreement and all of which, when
taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement.    A-10   (h) Severability. If any term or other provision of
this Escrow Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by
any law or public policy, all other terms or provisions of this Escrow
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Escrow Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated
to the greatest extent possible. (i) Waiver of Offset Rights. The Escrow
Agent hereby waives any and all rights to offset that it may have against the

transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiary\'s bank or an
intermediary bank designated. The parties to this Escrow Agreement
acknowledge that these security procedures are commercially reasonable.

LETTER  -------------------------   ________, 2006  Darling International
Inc. 251 O\'Connor Ridge Blvd., Suite 300 Irving, Texas 75038 Attn: General
Counsel  Dear Sir/Madam:   Reference is made to the terms of that certain
Asset Purchase Agreement dated December 19, 2005 (the "Agreement"), among
National By-Products, LLC, an Iowa limited liability company ("Seller"),
Darling National LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Purchaser"), and
Darling International Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), pursuant to
which Purchaser will acquire substantially all of Seller\'s assets in
exchange for consideration including the issuance of new shares representing
twenty percent of the outstanding shares of Parent\'s common stock, par value
$0.01 per share ("Parent Common Stock"), on the Closing Date (the
"Transaction"). Terms used but not defined in this letter shall have the
meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement.   I understand that I may
be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Seller, as such term is defined for
purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 ("Rule 145") promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (including the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the "Act").   If in fact I were to be deemed an
"affiliate" of Seller under paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145, my ability to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of Parent Common Stock
received by me pursuant to the Transaction may be restricted under current
law.   I hereby represent, warrant and covenant to Parent that:   I will
not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Parent Common Stock
unless (i) such sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition has been
registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition
is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Act (as such
rule may be amended from time to time), or (iii) in the opinion of counsel in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or under a "no-action"
letter obtained by me from the staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"), (a) such sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition
will not violate or is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act and
(b) such sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition otherwise complies with
all applicable laws;    B-1   I hereby acknowledge that Parent is under
no obligation to register the sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition by
me of Parent Common Stock or to take any other action necessary for the
purpose of making an exemption from registration available.   I understand
that Parent will issue stop transfer instructions to its transfer agent with
respect to Parent Common Stock to be received in the Transaction and that a
restrictive legend will be placed on certificates delivered to me evidencing
such Parent Common Stock in substantially the following form:   "This
certificate and the shares represented hereby have been issued  pursuant to a
transaction governed by Rule 145 ("Rule 145")  promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  "Securities Act"), and may be sold
or otherwise disposed of only in  accordance with the terms of a letter
agreement, dated ____________,  2006, between the holder of this certificate
and the issuer of this  security (a copy of which is on file in the principal
office of such  issuer) which contains further restrictions on the
transferability of  the shares represented hereby."   It is understood and
agreed that the legend set forth above will be removed by delivery of
substitute certificates without such legend if such legend is not required
for purposes of the Act. It is understood and agreed that such legends and
the stop orders referred to above will be removed if (i) the securities have
been sold in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Act, (ii)
Parent Common Stock received by me in the Transaction are registered for sale
by me under the Act or (iii) Parent has received either an opinion of counsel
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a "no-action"
letter obtained by me from the staff of the SEC, to the effect that the
restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the Act no longer apply to me.   The
term "Parent Common Stock" as used in this letter shall mean and include not
only the common stock of Parent as presently constituted, but also any other
stock which may be issued in exchange for, in lieu of, or in addition to, all
or any part of such Parent Common Stock.   I hereby acknowledge that I have
read this letter and the Agreement and discussed the requirements of such
documents and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer
or otherwise dispose of shares of Parent Common Stock to the extent I felt
necessary with my counsel.   This letter will be governed by the laws of
Texas regardless of any applicable principles of conflict of laws. This
letter will be binding upon the undersigned and Parent and their respective
successors and assigns. This letter is the complete agreement between the
undersigned and Parent concerning the subject matter hereof. If the Agreement
is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Closing Date, then
the legal effect of this letter will thereupon automatically terminate.  
B-2   Execution of this letter shall not be construed as an admission on
my part of "affiliate" status nor as a waiver of any rights that I may have
to object to any claim that I am an "affiliate" on or after the date of
this letter.   Very truly yours,    -------------------------------

EXHIBIT C   NONCOMPETITION AND NONSOLICITATION AGREEMENT 
--------------------------------------------    This NONCOMPETITION AND
NONSOLICITATION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of
the [__] day of [____________], 2006, by and among Darling International
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Darling National LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Company"),
and Dean Carlson ("Executive").   WHEREAS, Company and Parent have entered
into that certain Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement")
with National By-Products, LLC, an Iowa limited liability company ("Seller"),
dated as of December 19, 2005, and capitalized terms used herein shall have
the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Asset Purchase Agreement; and  
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Seller will sell to
Company, and Company will purchase from Seller, substantially all of
Seller\'s assets (the "Transaction"); and   WHEREAS, in order to induce
Company and Parent to enter into the Asset Purchase Agreement, Seller agreed
that Executive would enter into an agreement to refrain from entering into
competition with and/or engaging in solicitation with respect to the Business
(as defined below); and   WHEREAS, Executive is the Chairman of Seller\'s
Board of Managers and a holder of equity interests in Seller; and  
WHEREAS, Executive will derive a significant benefit from the Transaction as
a result of his ownership of equity interests in Seller; and   WHEREAS,
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the
execution of this Agreement is a condition precedent to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated therein.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the foregoing and the mutual promises and undertakings in this Agreement, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:  1.
Noncompetition. For a period of five (5) years from the date
hereof, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate,
control or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of
any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or
otherwise, engaged in the Business or that otherwise competes with the
Business (a "Restricted Business"). The parties hereto specifically
acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for any breach of the foregoing
will be inadequate and that Company and Parent, in addition to any other
relief available to it, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive relief without the necessity of    C-1  proving actual damage
or posting any bond whatsoever. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Business" means the business of Company, including (a) the collection and
conversion of animal and poultry by-products from the meat processing and
restaurant industries into fats and protein meal products, (b) the
collection, processing and marketing of animal hides, and (c) the sale of the
processed products to livestock and pet food manufacturers, among
other customers, throughout the United States and internationally.  2. Non-
solicitation. For a period of five (5) years from the date hereof, Executive
shall not, and shall not permit any of his or her Affiliates to, directly or
indirectly: (a) cause, solicit, induce or encourage any Employees of Company
or Seller to leave such employment or hire, employ or otherwise engage any
such individual or (b) cause, induce or encourage any material actual
or prospective client, customer, supplier or licensor of the Business
(including any existing or former customer of Seller and any Person that
becomes a client or customer of the Business after the Closing) or any other
Person who has a material business relationship with the Business, to
terminate or modify any such actual or prospective relationship.  3.
Confidentiality. From and after the date hereof, Executive shall not
and shall cause his or her Affiliates and their respective officers and
directors not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or
communicate to any Person other than authorized officers, directors and
employees of Parent or Company or use or otherwise exploit for its own
benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than the Parent or Company, any
Confidential Information (as defined below). Executive and his or her
Affiliates shall not have any obligation to keep confidential any
Confidential Information if and to the extent disclosure thereof is
specifically required by law; provided, however, that in the event disclosure
is required by applicable Law, Executive shall, to the extent reasonably
possible, provide Parent with prompt notice of such requirement prior to
making any disclosure so that Parent may seek an appropriate protective
order. For purposes of this Section 3, "Confidential Information" means any
information with respect to the Business, including methods of operation,
customers, customer lists, products, prices, fees, costs, Technology,
inventions, Trade Secrets, know-how, Software, marketing methods, plans,
personnel, suppliers, competitors, markets or other specialized information
or proprietary matters. Confidential Information does not include, and there
shall be no obligation hereunder with respect to, information that (a) is
generally available to the public on the date of this Agreement or
(b) becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure not otherwise permissible hereunder.  4. Acknowledgments;
Injunctive Relief.   (a) Executive acknowledges and agrees that the
restrictive covenants contained in Section 1, Section 2 and Section 3 are
reasonable with respect to their duration and scope, and reasonable and
necessary to protect legitimate business interests of Company and Parent.
Executive also acknowledges and agrees that Parent and Company are relying on
the agreements contained herein in entering into the transactions
contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement.    C-2   (b) The parties
acknowledge that a breach of this Agreement by Executive would cause
irreparable injury to Company and Parent, the amount of which will be
impossible to estimate or determine and which cannot be
adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy at law for any breach of this
Agreement will be inadequate. Therefore, Company and Parent will be entitled
to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from any court
of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this Agreement
without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond
whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by this Section 4(b) are
cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which Company or
Parent may have hereunder or at law or in equity.  5. Notices. All notices
and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall
be deemed given (a) when delivered personally by hand (with written
confirmation of receipt), (b) when sent by facsimile (with
written confirmation of transmission) or (c) one Business Day following the
day sent by overnight courier (with written confirmation of receipt), in each
case at the following addresses and facsimile numbers (or to such other

Interpretation.   (a) Ambiguities. The parties hereto have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event
an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as jointly drafted by the parties hereto and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.    C-3  
(b) Headings. The Sections and other subdivisions and the insertion of
headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect or
be utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All references in
this Agreement to any "Section" are to the corresponding Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise specified.   (c) Governing Law. This Agreement
and all matters based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws, both procedural and
substantive, of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of laws
provisions that if applied might require the application of the laws of
another jurisdiction.   (d) Severability. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law
or public policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.  7.
Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement represents
the entire understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by
written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the
party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement,
including without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party,
shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of
compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver
of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure
on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.    C-4  8.
Assignment/Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to
create any third party beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party
to this Agreement except as provided below. No assignment of this Agreement
or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by either Parent or
Company (by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of Executive and any attempted assignment without the required consents shall
be void; provided, however, that Parent and Company may assign this Agreement
and any or all rights or obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of Parent,
any Person from which it has borrowed money or any Person to which Parent or
any of its Affiliates proposes to sell all or substantially all of the assets
relating to the Business. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references
in this Agreement to Parent or Company, as applicable, shall also apply to
any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires. The rights of
Executive under this Agreement may not be assigned or encumbered by
Executive, voluntarily or involuntarily, and any attempted assignment shall
be void.  9. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.     [THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE IS

Blvd. 251 O\'Connor Ridge Blvd. Suite 300 Suite 300 Irving, TX 75038 Irving,
TX 75038  Ladies and Gentlemen:   We have acted as counsel for National
By-Products, LLC ("Seller") in connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement
(the "Purchase Agreement") dated as of December 19, 2005 among Darling
International Inc. (Parent), Darling National LLC ("Purchaser") and Seller.
This opinion is being rendered to you at the request of Seller pursuant to
Section 9.1(x) of the Purchase Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in
the Purchase Agreement.   We have examined originals or copies, certified or
otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate
records, certificates of public officials, and other instruments and have
conducted such other investigations of fact and law as we have deemed
necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.   Based upon the
foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and exceptions hereinafter set
forth, we are of the opinion that:   1. Seller is a limited liability
company validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Iowa and has all requisite limited liability company power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted. Seller is duly qualified to     G-1  December 19,
2005 Page 2   transact business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction identified in Schedule 1 hereto.   2.
Seller has all requisite limited liability company power and authority to
execute and deliver the Seller Documents (which for the purpose of this
letter also includes the Purchase Agreement) and to perform its
obligations thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of the Seller
Documents by Seller have been duly authorized by all necessary limited
liability company action on the part of Seller. The Seller Documents have
been duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller and (assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the other parties thereto
and assuming the applicability of Iowa law) constitute the legal, valid and
binding obligation of Seller, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors\' rights and
remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles
of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and
fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at
law or in equity).   3. The execution and delivery by Seller of the Seller
Documents and the performance by Seller of its obligations thereunder will
not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of Seller\'s operating agreement or bylaws,
(ii) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material document,
agreement or other instrument to which Seller is a party or by which it is
bound of which we are aware, (iii)Iowa or federal law or regulation (other
than federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no
opinion in this paragraph) or (iv) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree,
order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on Seller of
which we are aware.   4. No consent, approval, waiver, license or
authorization or other action by or filing with any Iowa or federal
governmental authority is required in connection with the execution and
delivery by Seller of the Seller Documents to which it is a party, the
consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated thereby or the
performance by Seller of its obligations thereunder, except for the filings
required to be made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of
1976, as amended, and for filings and other actions required pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933 and/or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the
rules and regulations thereunder and federal and state securities or blue sky
laws, and except those already obtained or which are not listed on Company
Disclosure Schedule 7.3 or waived by Parent and Purchaser.   5. To our
knowledge, there is no litigation, proceeding or governmental investigation
pending or overtly threatened against Seller that relates to any of the
transactions contemplated by the Seller Documents to which it is a
party.    G-2  December 19, 2005 Page 3    6. Seller has amended its
Rights Agreement, dated as of January 1, 1999, such that it shall terminate
immediately prior to the Closing.   The foregoing opinions are subject to
the following qualifications and exceptions:   A. We express no opinion
with respect to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Iowa and
the federal laws of the United States of America, as now in effect. To the
extent the Seller Documents provide that they are to be governed by the law
of jurisdictions other than the Iowa, we have assumed at your request that
such documents are instead governed by Iowa law. There may be material
differences between the law of Iowa and such other jurisdictions and there is
no reasonable expectation that Iowa law will apply. Accordingly, we express
no opinion and make no representation as to the appropriateness of the
assumption regarding Iowa law as governing. We express no opinion as to any
ordinance or regulation of any municipal, county, township or other local
governmental authority.   B. We have assumed the genuineness of all
signatures appearing on the documents examined by us other than Seller on the
Purchase Agreement, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the
genuineness, completeness and authenticity of all documents submitted to us
as originals and the conformity with genuine, complete and authentic
originals of all documents submitted to us as copies.   C. We express no
opinion in connection with the Purchase Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby, and no opinion may be implied or inferred, except as
expressly set forth in this opinion letter.   D. When an opinion set forth
herein is given to our knowledge or of which we are aware, that knowledge or
awareness is limited to the actual knowledge of the individual lawyers in the
firm who have participated directly in the matters referred to us by Seller
and its representatives in the course of our regular representation of
Seller, without any special or additional investigation undertaken for
purposes of this opinion.   E. The opinions expressed herein are made as of
the date hereof, and we do not undertake to update this opinion with respect
to any changes of which we may later become aware.   F. This opinion letter
is limited in its use solely to reliance by you and the lenders of Parent in
consummating the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. No
other person or entity may rely or claim reliance upon this opinion letter,
and it is not to be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise   
G-3  December 19, 2005 Page 4   referred to or furnished to any other
person or entity without the prior written consent of this firm.   G. We
have assumed that you have all requisite power and authority and have taken
all necessary action to execute and deliver the Purchase Agreement and to
authorize the performance of your obligations thereunder, that the Purchase
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by you and that the Purchase
Agreement is the valid and binding obligation of you, enforceable against you
in accordance with its terms.   H. We express no opinion with respect to the
governing law, submission to jurisdiction, non-competition, waiver of bulk
sales laws or liquidated damages provisions in the Seller Documents.   Very
truly yours,   NYEMASTER, GOODE, WEST,  HANSELL and O\'BRIEN, P.C.   By

authorization, execution and delivery of, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by, that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated as
of December 19, 2005 by and among Parent, Purchaser and National By-Products,
LLC (the "Purchase Agreement"). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Purchase
Agreement.   In so acting, we have examined originals or copies (certified
or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of (a)(i) the Purchase
Agreement, (ii) the Escrow Agreement dated as of the date hereof, by and
among Parent, National By-Products, LLC and U.S. Bank, N.A. (the "Escrow

as of the date hereof, by and between Parent and Dean Carlson (the
"Noncompetition Agreement" and together with the Purchase Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, the "Transaction Documents") and (b) such corporate and
limited liability company records, agreements, documents and other
instruments, and such certificates or comparable documents of public
officials and of officers and representatives of Parent and Purchaser, and
have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as we have
deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set
forth.   In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of
all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity
of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original
documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or
photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter
documents. As to all questions of fact material to these opinions that have
not been independently established, we have relied upon certificates or
comparable documents of officers and representatives of Parent and Purchaser
and upon the representations and warranties of Parent and Purchaser contained
in the Purchase Agreement. As used herein, "to our knowledge" and "of which
we are aware" mean the conscious awareness of facts or other information by
any lawyer in our firm actively involved in the transactions contemplated by

lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted.   2. Purchaser is a limited liability company validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all
requisite limited liability company power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being

Purchase Agreement have been duly authorized and, when issued as contemplated
by the Purchase Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights pursuant to law or in Parent\'s
Certificate of Incorporation.   4. Each of Parent and Purchaser has all
requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority, as
applicable, to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents to which it is a
party and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution, delivery and
performance by each of Parent and Purchaser of the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or
limited liability company action, as applicable, on the part of each of
Parent and Purchaser. The Transaction Documents to which each of Parent and
Purchaser are a party have been duly and validly executed and delivered by
each of Parent and Purchaser and (assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery thereof by the other parties thereto), constitute the legal,
valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable
against it in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws affecting creditors\' rights and remedies generally, and
subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including
principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in
equity) and except that (A) rights to indemnification and
contribution thereunder may be limited by federal or state securities laws or
public policy relating thereto, (B) no opinion is expressed with respect to
Section 7.7 of the Purchase Agreement, (C) enforceability may be affected by
any failure to comply with the bulk sales laws of any jurisdiction and (D) no
opinion is expressed with respect to any provision of the Transaction
Documents providing for liquidated damages.   5. The execution and delivery
by Purchaser of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the
performance by Purchaser of its obligations thereunder will not conflict
with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions
or provisions of Purchaser\'s certificate of formation or limited liability
company agreement, (ii) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
material document, agreement or other instrument to which Purchaser is a
party or by which it is bound of which we are aware, (iii) New York, Delaware
corporate or federal law or regulation (other than federal and state
securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this
paragraph) or (iv) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of
any court or governmental authority binding on Purchaser of which we are
aware.    H-2   6. The execution and delivery by Parent of the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the performance by Parent of
its obligations thereunder will not conflict with, constitute a default under
or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of Parent\'s
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (ii) any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any material document, agreement or other instrument to which
Parent is a party or by which it is bound of which we are aware, (iii) New

any court or governmental authority binding on Parent of which we are
aware.   7. Except for the filings required to be made under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended, no
consent, approval, waiver, license or authorization or other action by or
filing with any New York state or federal governmental authority is required
