STOCK AND ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

  

  

  

This Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement is dated as of April 26, 2013, between
Eastman Kodak Company, a New Jersey corporation ("Seller"), the other Seller
Parties listed on the signature pages hereto (together with Seller, the
"Principal Seller Parties"), and KPP Trustees Limited, as trustee for the KPP
("Purchaser" and, together with the Principal Seller Parties, each a "Party"
and together the "Parties").

  

  

W I T N E S S E T H:

  

  

WHEREAS, on January 19, 2012 (the "Petition Date"), Seller and certain of its
Affiliates (the "Debtors") filed petitions under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code, 11 U.S.C. § 101 et seq. (as in effect on the date of this Agreement and
as may be amended from time to time, the "Bankruptcy Code") in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, commencing
their Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases (the "Bankruptcy Cases");

  

  

WHEREAS, Purchaser has filed the KPP Claims in the Bankruptcy Cases and also
asserts that KL is liable to Purchaser for certain funding obligations with
respect to the KPP;

  

  

WHEREAS, on the date hereof, or shortly thereafter in the case of a second
application to the Pension Regulator of the United Kingdom, Seller, Purchaser
and certain other parties are signing and delivering (a) a settlement
agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") resolving the KPP Claims and containing
a mutual release in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, (b) a deed under
English law in the form attached hereto as Exhibit X (the "RAA Deed")
providing for the apportionment of pension liabilities as between KL and a new
employer created by Purchaser for the purpose of acquiring substantially all
pension liabilities of KL and (c) an application to the Pensions Regulator of
the United Kingdom in the form attached hereto as Exhibit Y, and a subsequent
application materially in similar form to the document attached hereto as
Exhibit Y, made by the applicants to those applications (including Seller, KL,
Kodak Polychrome Graphics Finance UK Limited and their affiliates and
directors), both applications being for a clearance statement under section 42
and 46 of the Pensions Act, 2004, §§ 1 et. seq., c. 35 (Eng.) (together, the

unless Seller and Purchaser otherwise agree.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |

(or in the case of Shared Contracts, partially assign) to Purchaser; provided
that the Assumption List shall include any customer service contracts to which
Seller or any Debtor Subsidiary Seller is a party in respect of which (i)
prepayments for services were made by the counterparties thereof to Seller or
any Debtor Subsidiary Seller after January 19, 2012 and (ii) deferred service
revenue liabilities associated with such prepayments remain outstanding. All
365 Debtor Contracts listed in the Assumption List shall be "Assigned 365
Debtor Contracts" hereunder and all 365 Debtor Contracts not listed in the
Assumption List shall be Excluded Assets.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |

"Assumption and Assignment Motion") for an order of the Bankruptcy Court
authorizing the assignment to Purchaser of the Assigned 365 Debtor Contracts
pursuant to 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. Such request may be included in the
Settlement and Sale Motion, the motion to confirm the Chapter 11 Plan or a
separate Assumption and Assignment Motion, as Seller and Purchaser may
reasonably agree.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

All Assumption and Assignment Motions and related orders shall be in form and

(i)

  |  

In connection with the assumption and assignment of any Assigned 365 Debtor
Contract, the Cure Costs, as required by the Bankruptcy Code and provided in
the Settlement and Sale Order, shall be paid in full by Purchaser prior to
Closing and such payment shall not entitle Purchaser to any adjustment to the
Purchase Price. Seller and its Subsidiaries shall have no liability in
connection with the Cure Costs of any 365 Debtor Contract.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

Prior to the hearing before the Bankruptcy Court to assume any Assigned 365
Debtor Contracts, Purchaser shall provide adequate assurance of its future
performance under each applicable Assigned 365 Debtor Contract to the parties
thereto (other than the Debtors) as may be reasonably required in satisfaction
of Section 365(f)(2)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code and any applicable Orders of
the Bankruptcy Court. Purchaser agrees to promptly take all actions reasonably
required to assist in demonstrating adequate assurance of future performance
under the Assigned 365 Debtor Contracts, such as furnishing affidavits, non-
confidential financial information and other documents or information
necessary for filing with the Bankruptcy Court.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, if it becomes necessary to pay any
additional Cure Costs or make any other payments, or provide any assurances of
future payment or performance or take any other action in connection with the
assumption and assignment of an Assigned 365 Debtor Contract or any assurances
necessary to satisfy Purchaser's obligations under Section 2.1(h)(i) or
Section 2.1(h)(ii), Purchaser shall bear such costs and expenses and take such
actions as may be reasonably required in order to cause such Assigned 365
Debtor Contract to be assigned to Purchaser hereunder, in each case without
recourse to Seller or its Subsidiaries.

BFN Irrevocable Offer or BFN Local Transfer Agreement, (A) the BFN Sellers
shall not sell, convey, assign, deliver or transfer any asset or Liability
under this Agreement and (B) nothing in this Agreement shall apply to, or
govern, the sale, assignment, transfer, retention or assumption of assets,
rights, properties or Liabilities of, or by, the BFN Sellers, and no Party

acceptance of such BFN Irrevocable Offer and the execution of Exhibit B
thereto.

(ii)

  |  

If any BFN Irrevocable Offer has not been accepted as of the Closing by the
relevant BFN Seller, the Parties agree as follows:

(A)

  |  

Purchaser, Seller and EKSA will consummate the sale, conveyance, transfer,
assignment and delivery to Purchaser of the relevant BFN Swiss Assets, subject
to and simultaneously with the consummation of the sale, conveyance, transfer,
assignment and delivery to Purchaser of the corresponding BFN Assets.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(B)

  |  

Prior to the Closing, Seller and Purchaser will cooperate in good faith to
reach mutually acceptable arrangements to enable EKSA and the relevant BFN
Seller to continue to operate the Business as currently conducted by EKSA and
the relevant BFN Seller, until the earlier of (x) the acceptance or rejection
of the relevant BFN Irrevocable Offer or (y) the expiration thereof.

44  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

(k) Patent Maintenance Costs. If, between the date hereof and the Closing
Date, Seller has paid any maintenance fees due and payable to a patent office
or similar organization in respect of the Transferred Patents for any period
that ends after the Closing Date, the liability for such maintenance fees
shall be allocated, on a pro rata basis based on the number of calendar days,
(i) to Seller for the part of such period that ends on and including the

after the Closing Date. At Closing, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for any
part of such maintenance fees that are the responsibility of Purchaser under

(l) SSO Commitments. Purchaser acknowledges that the Transferred Patents are
assigned and transferred subject to the SSO Commitments. Purchaser hereby
commits to respect the SSO Commitments, solely with respect to the applicable
Transferred Patents, and solely to the same extent as the SSO Commitments are
binding upon Seller with respect to such Transferred Patents prior to the
transfer of the Transferred Patents herein; provided, however, that nothing
herein shall be construed as a commitment or agreement by Purchaser or its
Affiliates to subject any Patents other than the Transferred Patents to the
SSO Commitments. Purchaser shall confirm in writing to the U.S. Department of
Justice, Antitrust Division, to the extent (i) requested by such Government
Entity and (ii) required by applicable Law, the existence and scope of
Purchaser's commitments under this Section 2.1(l) with respect to such
Transferred Patents.

prior to the Closing Date) set forth in Schedule I shall take place unless
each of the other transactions are capable of being completed in full
(following the performance of the transactions listed before them), (y) if
Closing does not occur by the Outside Date, the Parties agree that any
transaction (excluding any transactions taking place prior to the Closing
Date) set forth in Schedule I that may have occurred before that date shall be
null, void and of no legal effect and the Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to reverse the effect of such transactions and place all
affected entities in the position that they were in immediately before the
first such transaction was completed and (z) to the extent that there is any
inconsistency between Schedule I and the terms of this Agreement (excluding
Schedule I), or any Ancillary Agreements, the terms of this Agreement
(excluding Schedule I), or any Ancillary Agreements, as applicable shall

  Section 2.6 Working Capital Adjustment.

  


 

  

(a) No later than 90 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare in
good faith and deliver to Seller a statement (the "Working Capital Statement")
in the form of the Form of Working Capital Statement that sets forth
Purchaser's calculation of Closing Adjusted Working Capital and Reference
Adjusted Working Capital, prepared in accordance with the Working Capital
Principles.

  

  

  

(b) Thereafter, at the request of Seller, Purchaser shall give Seller
reasonable access during normal business hours to Purchaser's working papers
and any working papers of Purchaser's independent accountants relating to the
preparation of the Working Capital Statement, as well as the books and records
of Purchaser that relate to the Business that are relevant to Purchaser's
calculation of Closing Adjusted Working Capital and Reference Adjusted Working
Capital; provided, however, that the independent accountants of Purchaser
shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to Seller unless
and until Seller has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless
agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants. In addition, Purchaser
shall make its representatives responsible for and knowledgeable about the
information used in, and the preparation and calculation of, the Working
Capital Statement, reasonably available to answer questions with respect to
the contents of the Working Capital Statement and Seller's calculation of
Closing Adjusted Working Capital and Reference Adjusted Working Capital.

  

  

(c) Seller shall be entitled to dispute the calculation of the Closing
Adjusted Working Capital or the Reference Adjusted Working Capital set forth
in the Working Capital Statement if it delivers a written notice (an
"Objection Notice") to Purchaser within 60 days after delivery of the Working
Capital Statement (the "Objection Period"). The Objection Notice shall contain
a reasonably detailed description of any changes that Seller proposes to be
made to the calculation of the Closing Adjusted Working Capital or the
Reference Adjusted Working Capital set forth in the Working Capital Statement.
If Seller does not deliver an Objection Notice to Purchaser within the
Objection Period, Seller shall not be entitled to dispute the calculation of
Closing Adjusted Working Capital or the Reference Adjusted Working Capital set
forth in the Working Capital Statement, which shall be final and binding on
each of the Parties.

  

  

  

(d) If Seller delivers an Objection Notice to Purchaser within the Objection
Period, Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
amount of the Closing Adjusted Working Capital and the Reference Adjusted
Working Capital during the period commencing on the date of delivery of the
Objection Notice and ending 30 days thereafter (the "Negotiation Period"). If
Seller and Purchaser agree in writing on the Closing Adjusted Working Capital
and the Reference Adjusted Working Capital (whether such amounts are the same
as or different from the amounts set forth in the Working Capital Statement)
during the Negotiation Period, the Closing Adjusted Working Capital and the
Reference Adjusted Working Capital shall be the amounts agreed upon by the
Parties.

  

  

  

(e) If Seller and Purchaser do not agree in writing on the Closing Adjusted
Working Capital or the Reference Adjusted Working Capital prior to the
expiration of the Negotiation Period, each Party shall (A) jointly engage
Plante Moran, or, if such firm declines to serve as accounting arbiter or the
Parties agree in writing not to engage such firm, such other firm of
independent public accountants as mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller
(the "Accounting Arbiter") and (B) submit to the Accounting Arbiter, not later
than 15 days after the end of the Negotiation Period, a statement containing
its calculation of the items in dispute (each, an "Arbiter Statement"), which
shall include only those items set forth in the Objection Notice that remain
in dispute at the expiration of the Negotiation Period. The Accounting
Arbiter, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, shall make a final and
binding determination as to all matters in dispute as promptly as practicable
after its appointment. In determining the proper amount of the Closing
Adjusted Working Capital and/or the Reference Adjusted Working Capital, as
applicable, the Accounting Arbiter shall be bound by the terms of this Section
2.6 and may not increase the amount of any item in dispute above the highest
amount set forth in the Arbiter Statement nor decrease any such amount below
the lowest amount set forth in the Arbiter Statement. The Accounting Arbiter
shall not review any line items or make any determination with respect to any
matter other than those matters set forth in the Arbiter Statement. The
Accounting Arbiter shall send its written determination of the Closing
Adjusted Working Capital and/or the Reference Adjusted Working Capital, as
applicable, to Seller and Purchaser, and such determination and calculation
shall be final and binding on the Parties, absent fraud or manifest error. The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbiter shall be borne by Purchaser and
Seller in inverse proportion to the dollar amount of the items in dispute set
forth in the Arbiter Statements as to which such Party prevails in the
accounting arbitration, which proportionate allocations shall also be
determined by the Accounting Arbiter at the time it renders its determination
on the merits of the matters in dispute. The Accounting Arbiter may not award
damages, interest or penalties to any party with respect to any matter.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

  

(f) Once a final and binding determination of the Closing Adjusted Working
Capital and the Reference Adjusted Working Capital has been made in accordance
with the applicable provisions of this Section 2.6: (i) if the Closing
Adjusted Working Capital is greater than the sum of $10 million plus the
Reference Adjusted Working Capital, then Purchaser shall make a payment to
Seller in accordance with Section 2.6(g) equal to the difference between (A)
the Closing Adjusted Working Capital and (B) the sum of $10 million plus the
Reference Adjusted Working Capital; (ii) if the Closing Adjusted Working
Capital is less than the sum of the Reference Adjusted Working Capital less
$10 million, then Seller shall make a payment to Purchaser in accordance with
Section 2.6(g) equal to the difference between (X) the sum of the Reference
Adjusted Working Capital less $10 million and (Y) the Closing Adjusted Working
Capital; or (iii) if the Closing Adjusted Working Capital is equal to or
greater than the sum of the Reference Adjusted Working Capital less $10
million and equal to or less than the sum of the Reference Adjusted Working
Capital plus $10 million, then neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be required
to make any payment to the other pursuant to this Section 2.6.

  

  

(g) Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 2.6(f) shall be made
no later than five (5) Business Days after a final and binding determination
of the Closing Adjusted Working Capital and the Reference Adjusted Working
Capital has been made in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
Section 2.6 (the "Payment Date") in immediately available funds to such
account or accounts as is designated in writing by the Party receiving such
payment; provided that if such payment required to be made exceeds $5 million,
then $5 million shall be paid no later than the Payment Date and the amount of
the payment exceeding $5 million shall be paid no later than the first
anniversary of the Payment Date.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2.6 to the contrary, if
any BFN Irrevocable Offer has not been accepted as of the Closing by the
relevant BFN Seller, then the Parties will cooperate in good faith to
reasonably agree on an equitable adjustment to the figures set forth in clause
(a) of the definitions of PI Reference Accounts Payable, PI Reference Accounts
Receivable, PI Reference Inventory, DI Reference Accounts Payable, DI
Reference Accounts Receivable and DI Reference Inventory to reflect the
exclusion of the relevant BFN Assets and BFN Swiss Assets from the calculation
of Reference Adjusted Working Capital and Closing Adjusted Working Capital.

  


 

  

Section 2.7 Contingent Purchase Price Adjustment.So long as Purchaser operates
the Business in a commercially reasonable manner and as if this Section 2.7
and Schedule II did not exist, Seller shall pay to Purchaser in cash the
amounts that may become due from time to time in accordance with the terms and
conditions of Schedule II, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $35 million.

  

  

Article III 
 

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

  

  

Except as set forth in (a) the Seller Disclosure Schedule or (b) to the extent
relating to the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities, Seller represents
and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

  

  

Section 3.1 Organization and Qualification. Seller and each Other Seller is
duly incorporated, founded or organized, as applicable, validly existing and,
to the extent such concept is applicable, in good standing under the Laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation, foundation or organization. Seller and
each Other Seller has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate the Transferred Assets, the Harrow Facility, the KEPS Plant,
the Rochester Sites and the Shared Sites held by such Person, and to carry on
the Business as and to the extent currently conducted by such Person. Seller
and each Other Seller is duly qualified to do business and, to the extent such
concept is applicable, is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of the Transferred Assets, the
Harrow Facility, the KEPS Plant, the Rochester Sites and the Shared Sites held
by, or the conduct of the Business conducted by, such Person requires such
qualification, except for failures to be so qualified or in good standing, as
the case may be, that would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate with such other failures, to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 3.2 Corporate Authority.Subject to the entry of the Settlement and
Sale Order and the receipt of other Consents from the Bankruptcy Court in
connection with the Transactions (collectively, the "Bankruptcy Consents"),
Seller has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all
corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement and to
consummate the Transactions. Each Non-Debtor Subsidiary Seller and, subject to
the Bankruptcy Consents, each Debtor Subsidiary Seller has, or prior to the
Closing will have, all requisite corporate power and authority necessary to
consummate the Transactions. Subject to the receipt of the Bankruptcy
Consents, this Agreement is, and when executed and delivered by Seller, each
Ancillary Agreement will be, a valid and binding agreement of Seller
enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

50

other equity interests as of the date of this Agreement, the identity of each
holder of its outstanding capital stock or other equity interests as of the
date of this Agreement and the number and class of shares of capital stock or
other equity interests held by each such holder as of the date of this
Agreement. Seller or an Other Seller has good and valid title to all of the
outstanding capital stock and other equity interests of the Transferred
Subsidiary, in each case, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Encumbrances). All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Transferred Subsidiary have been validly issued and, to the extent the
Transferred Subsidiary is incorporated or organized in a jurisdiction where
such concepts are applicable, are fully paid and non-assessable. There are no
options, warrants, convertible securities or other rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments relating to the shares of capital stock of the
Transferred Subsidiary (other than this Agreement) or obligating Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or any
other interest in, the Transferred Subsidiary. The Transferred Subsidiary has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
respective assets, and to carry on the Business as and to the extent currently
conducted by the Transferred Subsidiary. The Transferred Subsidiary is duly
incorporated, founded or organized, as applicable, validly existing and, to
the extent such concept is applicable, in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, foundation or organization. The Transferred
Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept is
applicable, is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction
where the ownership or operation of the assets held by, or the conduct of the
Business conducted by, such Person requires such qualification, except for
failures to be so qualified or in good standing, as the case may be, that
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate with such
other failures, to have a Material Adverse Effect. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be construed to grant to Purchaser any right to continue to use the name
"Kodak" in the name of the Transferred Subsidiary and Purchaser agrees to
change the corporate or business name of the Transferred Subsidiary on the
Closing Date (or, if appropriate, on a later date when all Consents from any
Government Entity of China are obtained to effect the transfer of the
Transferred Shares) to a corporate or business name that does not use "Kodak"
or any similar name.

and the consummation by Seller of the Transactions, except those that the
failure to make or obtain would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate with other such failures, (a) to have a Material Adverse Effect
or (b) to prevent, impair or materially delay the ability of Seller to
consummate the Transactions.

  

  

Section 3.5 Non-Contravention.Subject to the receipt of the Bankruptcy
Consents, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement by Seller does not, and the consummation by Seller and the
Other Sellers of the Transactions will not, constitute or result in (a) a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or comparable organizational documents of any of the Seller Parties,
(b) a breach or violation of, a default under, or an acceleration of any
obligations or the creation of a Lien on the Transferred Assets or the assets
of the Transferred Subsidiary (with or without notice, lapse of time or both)
pursuant to, any Material Contract or the DIP Facilities, (c) assuming the
making of notices, reports and filings and the obtaining of Consents referred
to in Section 3.4 of this Agreement and Section 3.4 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, a breach or violation of or a default under any Law to which any
Seller Party is subject or (d) a violation or contravention of any Order
issued by the Bankruptcy Court in the Bankruptcy Cases, except, in the case of
clauses (b) and (c) above, for any breach, violation, default, acceleration or
creation that would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate with other such breaches, violations, defaults, accelerations or
creations, to have a Material Adverse Effect.

grant a license to any of the Transferred Patents on royalty-free terms and
conditions on or after the Closing. The consummation of the Transactions shall
not alter, impair or extinguish any ownership rights in any Business
Intellectual Property as such are possessed or owned by the Seller Parties
immediately prior to the Closing (other than assignment of the Business
Intellectual Property to Purchaser hereunder).

of any future event, excluding, in each case, disclosures to employees and
Third Party contractors pursuant to customary confidentiality and non-
disclosure obligations.

  

  

(l) To the Knowledge of Seller, none of the Transferred Seller Software or
Software licensed to Purchaser pursuant to the Software Intellectual Property
License Agreement contains any malicious code (including any malware, worm,
bomb, backdoor, clock, timer or other disabling device, code, design or
routine) designed to permit unauthorized access, or cause such Software to
materially malfunction (including by corrupting data), either automatically,
with the passage of time or upon command by any Person. The Seller Parties
have implemented commercially reasonable measures to protect and maintain the
confidentiality of all confidential information included in the Business
Intellectual Property and the security of its confidential information
maintained in its information technology hardware. In the 24 months prior to

criminal or administrative action, suit, demand, claim, hearing, proceeding or
investigation pending, or to the Knowledge of Seller threatened in writing,
against or relating to any of the Seller Parties in connection with the

proceedings or investigations, to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
impair or materially delay the ability of Seller to consummate the Closing.
Except for the Bankruptcy Cases, none of the Transferred Assets is subject to

result in any change of control or similar payment (whether or not contingent)
becoming due to any Employee, (ii) increase any benefits under any Transferred

thereunder including ERISA and the Code. Seller and its Affiliates have
performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by
them under any Transferred Employee Plan and are not in any material respect
in default under or in violation of any Transferred Employee Plan. No material
action, claim, investigation or proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, threatened in writing, with respect to any Transferred Employee Plan
(other than claims for benefits in the Ordinary Course), and no fact or event
exists, to the Knowledge of Seller, that could give rise to any such action,
claim or proceeding.

give rise to any such Liability.

to the taxes imposed by Section 409A of the Code.

visa or otherwise has the lawful right to work in the country in which they
are currently working. Seller has in its files a Form I-9 that, to the
Knowledge of Seller, was completed in accordance with applicable Law for each
Employee for whom such form is required under applicable Law.

  

  

(n) No Employee based in the United Kingdom has transferred employment to

fire, health, safety, building, zoning or other land use regulatory

Seller there are no disputes, actions or violations that would reasonably be

access and rights of way, except as would not materially affect the use of
such Material Real Property Improvements in the operation of the Business. All
Material Real Property Improvements are in compliance with all applicable
Laws, except to the extent that failure to so comply would not (i) prevent the

corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its
respective properties and assets or the conduct of its respective business

power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and each

with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
by Purchaser and the consummation by Purchaser of the Transactions, except
those that the failure to make or obtain that would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate with other such failures, to
prevent, materially delay or impair the ability of Purchaser to consummate the
Transactions.

Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement by Purchaser does not, and the
consummation by Purchaser of the Transactions will not, constitute or result

incorporation, bylaws or comparable organizational documents of Purchaser, (b)
a breach or violation of, a default under, or an acceleration of any
obligations or the creation of a Lien on the Transferred Assets (with or

Purchaser is a party or (c) assuming compliance with the matters referred to
in Section 4.3 of this Agreement, a breach or violation of or a default under
any Law to which Purchaser is subject, except, in the case of clauses (b) and
(c), for any breach, violation, default, acceleration or creation that would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate with other such
breaches, violations, defaults, accelerations or creations, to prevent, impair
or materially delay the ability of Purchaser to consummate the Transactions.

investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against or
relating to Purchaser, other than those that would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate with such other actions, suits, demands,
claims, hearings, proceedings or investigations, to prevent, impair or
materially delay the ability of Purchaser to consummate the Closing. Purchaser
is not subject to any Order of any Government Entity of competent

(ii)

  |  

subject to Section 5.3(h), in the event that any Order is entered or issued,
or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding
or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the Transactions in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Transactions, use reasonable best efforts necessary to resist, vacate, modify,
reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove prior to the Outside Date such
actual or anticipated Order so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as

obligations, after being provided notice thereof).

  

  

(j) For the avoidance of doubt, the covenants under this Section 5.3 shall not

give Purchaser and its authorized representatives, upon reasonable advance
written notice to Kenneth Fillion (with a copy to Paula Gutkin) and during
regular business hours, reasonable access to (x) all books, records and
personnel and other facilities and properties to the extent relating to the
Business that Purchaser may reasonably request (including for the purpose of
conducting Phase I environmental site assessments on the Transferred Real
Property and the other Real Property set forth on Section 5.4(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule) and (y) Seller's accountants, legal counsel, financial
advisors and other authorized outside representatives; provided, however, that
any such (i) access shall be conducted at Purchaser's expense, in accordance
with Law (including any applicable Antitrust Law and Bankruptcy Law), at a
reasonable time, under the supervision of the Seller Parties' personnel and in
such a manner as to maintain confidentiality and not to interfere with the
normal operations of the businesses of the Seller Parties and their
Affiliates, and (ii) the Seller Parties will not be required to provide to
Purchaser access to or copies of any personnel records, books, files or other
documentation relating to the Employees other than the Transferred Employee
Records. In addition, prior to the Closing, Seller shall furnish Purchaser
with such monthly internal management reports concerning the Business as are
prepared in the Ordinary Course. All requests for information made pursuant to
this Section 5.4(a) shall be directed to an executive officer of Seller or
such Person as may be designated by any such officer. All information made
available pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) shall be governed by the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that prior to
making any records available to Purchaser, Seller and its Subsidiaries may
redact any portions thereof to the extent such portions do not relate in any
way to the Business.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other
agreement between Purchaser and Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
executed on or prior to the date of this Agreement, Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall not have any obligation to make available to Purchaser or
its representatives, or provide Purchaser or its representatives with, (i) any
Tax Return filed by any Seller Party or any of their Affiliates or
predecessors, or any related material or Tax work papers (other than (I) Tax
Returns and Tax work papers that relate solely to the Transferred Subsidiary
or (II) Tax Returns and Tax work papers, or the portion thereof (to the extent
reasonably separable therefrom), for sales and use Taxes, value added Taxes
and goods and services Taxes and similar Taxes that solely relate to the
Business) or (ii) any information if making such information available would
(A) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (B) potentially
cause any Seller Party to be found in contravention of any applicable Law or
in contravention of any fiduciary duty, duty of confidentiality or Contract
(including any confidentiality agreement to which any Seller Party or any of
their Affiliates are a party), it being understood that the Seller Parties
shall cooperate in any reasonable efforts and requests for waivers that would
enable otherwise required disclosure to Purchaser to occur without so
jeopardizing privilege or contravening such Law, duty or Contract.

  

  

(c) In connection with any inspection of Real Property prior to the Closing,
Purchaser agrees that in entering upon and inspecting such property, Purchaser
and its authorized agents and representatives (i) will comply with any
reasonable requirements or guidelines imposed or established by Seller

disturb tenants or interfere with the use of such property pursuant to any
lease; shall not interfere with the operation and maintenance of such
property; shall not damage any part of such property or any personal property
owned or held by a tenant or any other Person or entity; shall not physically
injure or otherwise cause bodily harm to Seller, any tenant or to any of their
respective agents, invitees, contractors and employees; shall not permit any
liens to attach to such property by reason of the exercise of Purchaser's
rights under this Section 5.4(c); and shall not reveal or disclose any
information obtained from Seller or as a result of inspections concerning such
property to any Third Party (other than Purchaser's and Seller's
representatives), except in accordance with the terms set forth in Section
5.10. Purchaser will, and shall cause its authorized agents and
representatives to, maintain comprehensive general liability (occurrence)
insurance on terms and in amounts reasonably satisfactory to Seller and
workers' compensation insurance in statutory limits to the extent Purchaser or
any authorized agent or representative performs any physical inspection or
sampling at any Real Property in accordance with this Section 5.4(c). In each
case (other than with respect to worker's compensation insurance), such
policies shall insure Seller, Purchaser, Seller's property manager (if any),
and such other parties as Seller shall reasonably request, and Purchaser shall
deliver to Seller evidence of insurance verifying such coverage prior to entry
upon the Real Property. Purchaser shall also (i) promptly pay when due the
costs of all inspections and examinations done by Purchaser or on Purchaser's
behalf with regard to such Real Property; (ii) cause all such inspections to
be conducted in accordance with standards customarily employed in the industry
and in compliance with all Laws; (iii) upon termination of this Agreement
other than by reason of Seller's default, at Seller's written request,
promptly furnish to Seller copies of any Third Party studies, reports or test
results received by Purchaser regarding such Real Property in connection with
any such inspections; and (iv) restore such Real Property to the condition in
which it was found before any such entry upon the Real Property and inspection
or examination was undertaken. Purchaser shall not communicate with or contact
any tenant of Seller or any of Seller's vendors or consultants about the
Business or such Real Property without the prior written consent of Seller, in
Seller's reasonable discretion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no destructive testing or sampling of surface or subsurface
soils, surface water, groundwater, or any materials in, on or under any Real
Property, shall be conducted during any entry by Purchaser or any of
Purchaser's authorized agents or representatives upon such Real Property
without Seller's prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event Seller consents in writing to
any such testing or sampling, Purchaser will, and will cause its agents and
representatives to, conduct such activities in accordance with the terms and
limitations, if any, set forth in Seller's consent.

Section 5.5 Public Announcements.Subject to (a) the provisions of Section
7.3(b) with respect to communications and announcements to the Employees and
the employees of Purchaser and (b) each Party's disclosure obligations imposed
by Law (including any obligations under any Bankruptcy Laws or the rules of
any stock exchange on which the securities of each Party or any of its
Affiliates are listed), during the period from the date of this Agreement
until the Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, cooperate with the other Party in the development
and distribution of all news releases, other public information disclosures
and announcements relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any
of the Transactions; provided, however, that (x) Seller shall be permitted to
disclose the terms of this Agreement to any court or to any liquidator and
show appropriate figures in their administration records, accounts and returns
and (y) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be permitted, in its sole
discretion, to discuss all matters related to this Agreement nd the Ancillary
Agreements with the Pension Regulator of the United Kingdom and the Pension

Section 5.6 Further Actions.

  

  

(a) If a Party proposes prior to Closing a change in the terms or structure of
this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions that would
avoid costs and expenses or would otherwise be more efficient from a tax,
legal, commercial or other perspective, the Parties will consider and discuss
in good faith the proposed change and the equitable allocation of its benefits
and, if the Parties mutually agree on such proposed change, will reasonably
cooperate in amending the terms or structure of this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements or the Transactions, in each case, as necessary to effect such
change; provided, however, that the principle in respect of any equitable
allocation of benefits shall be that the benefits shall first be allocated
such that neither Party nor its Affiliates have any unreimbursed cost, loss or
liability but shall otherwise remain where they fall provided further that no
Party shall have any obligation to make any change the net of which effect
(after taking into account of any benefits allocation) is adverse (whether
from a tax, legal, commercial or other perspective) to such Party and its
Affiliates in such Party's reasonable determination. In addition and to the
extent that it does not involve any change in the terms or structure of this
Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions (whether
because this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements envisaged more than
one possible option in any respect or otherwise), Seller, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate and to procure that their respective Affiliates will cooperate with
Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing to enable Purchaser and Seller to put in place
a sale and acquisition structure which meets the Tax and commercial objectives
of Purchaser and Seller; provided, however, that Seller, Purchaser and their
respective Affiliates shall not be required to take any step pursuant to this
Section 5.6(a) which would give rise to an unreimbursed cost, loss or
liability of Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates which
would not otherwise have arisen; and provided, further, that the Party
requesting such assistance shall indemnify the other Party for any reasonable
out of pocket costs incurred with respect to such assistance.

  

  

(b) As soon as practicable after the Closing, Kodak shall instruct all
relevant outside counsel of the Seller Parties (i) that the ownership of
Business Registered IP has been assigned to Purchaser, (ii) to release to
Purchaser or Purchaser's counsel designated by Purchaser copies (which may be
electronic copies) of all documentation relating to the Business Registered IP
and prosecution thereof existing as of the Closing Date in the possession of
such outside counsel, and (iii) that Purchaser or Purchaser's counsel
designated by Purchaser may contact such outside counsel relative to
prosecution of the Transferred Intellectual Property at Purchaser's expense,
as applicable.

  

  

(c) From and after the Closing Date, each of the Parties shall execute and
deliver such documents and other papers and take such further actions as may
reasonably be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and give
effect to the Transactions, including the execution and delivery of such
assignments, deeds and other documents as may be necessary to transfer any
Transferred Assets as provided in this Agreement.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

(d) Tax Determination. Seller shall, and shall cause the Other Sellers to, use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts, at Purchaser's request, to
cooperate with Purchaser in Purchaser's efforts to obtain a written
confirmation from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs that the transactions
described in Schedule I do not constitute an "unauthorized employer payment"
(as such term is defined in Section 160(4) of the United Kingdom's Finance Act
of 2004).

  

  

Section 5.7 Seller Conduct of Business.During the period commencing on the
date of this Agreement and ending on the earlier to occur of the Closing and
the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, Seller
covenants that, subject to any limitation imposed as a result of being subject
to the Bankruptcy Cases and except as (a) Purchaser may approve (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (b) set forth in
Section 5.7 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (c) otherwise expressly
contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, the Settlement Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, (d) required by Law (including any applicable Bankruptcy
Law) or required or contemplated by or arising out of any Order of a
Bankruptcy Court, or (e) relates solely to Excluded Assets or Excluded
Liabilities, the Seller Parties (A) shall conduct the Business in the Ordinary
Course, (B) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in all material
respects the relationships and goodwill of the Business with its suppliers,
customers, distributors and other business relations, (C) use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the material tangible property included in the
Transferred Assets and the Material Real Property Improvements in satisfactory

(d) Purchaser and the Seller Parties acknowledge that the confidentiality
obligations set forth herein shall not extend to information, knowledge and
data that is publicly available or becomes publicly available through no act
or omission of the party owing a duty of confidentiality, or becomes available

confidentiality so long as such source is not, after reasonable inquiry, known
by such party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other
obligations of secrecy to the other party.

  

  

(e) In the event of a breach of the obligations hereunder by Purchaser, on the
one hand, or any Seller Party, on the other hand, Seller or Purchaser, as the

Ancillary Agreement or relates to any business or business segment of Seller
other than the Business, Purchaser shall, until the date that is 90 days after
the Closing Date (and thereafter only upon request of Seller), promptly
deliver such amount or instrument to the extent related to such other business
or business segment to the relevant Seller or any Other Seller (or any other
Affiliate of Seller), and (b) Seller or any of its Affiliates receives any
payment that is for the account of Purchaser according to the terms of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or relates to the Business, Seller shall,
and shall cause the Other Sellers to, until the date that is 90 days after the
Closing Date (and thereafter only upon request of Purchaser) promptly deliver
such amount or instrument to the extent related to the Business to Purchaser.
All amounts due and payable under this Section 5.11 shall be due and payable
by the applicable Party in immediately available funds, by wire transfer to
the account designated in writing by the relevant Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Party hereby undertakes to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to direct or forward all bills, invoices or like instruments to the
appropriate Party.

Section 5.12 Non-Assignable Assets.

  

  

(a) To the extent that any Seller Contract, Shared Contract or any other
Transferred Asset is not capable of being assigned (or, in the case of a
Shared Contract, partially assigned) to Purchaser on the date of this
Agreement (or, in the case of any Transferred Asset that is an asset provided
for in Section 7.1(d)(ii), transferred to a Purchaser Employer Plan) at the
Closing (or as soon as practicable after Closing) as contemplated by this
Agreement either under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable
Laws or the terms of any such Seller Contract, Shared Contract or Transferred
Asset (i) without the Consent of any Third Party or a Government Entity, or
consummating the Transactions without such Consent would result in a breach,
default, violation or contravention under any Seller Contract or Shared
Contract or (ii) without the formation or establishment of a Foreign
Acquisition Entity to purchase or receive, as applicable, the Transferred
Assets located in a particular jurisdiction (collectively, the "Non-Assignable
Assets"), this Agreement will not constitute an assignment thereof, or an
attempted assignment, unless and until any such Consent is obtained or Foreign
Acquisition Entity formed or established, as appropriate, including any
Consents obtained or Foreign Acquisition Entity is formed or established, as
appropriate, following the Closing. In the event that the sole reason that any
Non-Assignable Asset (other than any Non-Assignable Asset that is an asset
provided for in Section 7.1(d)(ii)) cannot be assigned to Purchaser is that a
Foreign Acquisition Entity has not been formed by Purchaser in an applicable
jurisdiction, then Seller shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to (i)
sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
purchase and assume, all of the equity interests of the Person in which such
Non-Assignable Assets are held, or (ii) transfer such Non-Assignable Assets to
an existing Subsidiary of Seller existing in the applicable jurisdiction and
sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
purchase and assume, all of the equity interests in such Subsidiary of Seller,
and, in both of the foregoing cases, such sale, conveyance, transfer,
assignment and delivery shall fully satisfy Seller's obligations with respect
to such Non-Assignable Assets hereunder and Seller shall have no further
liability with respect to such sold, conveyed, transferred, assigned and
delivered Person(s) thereafter. Until any such Consent is obtained or Foreign
Acquisition Entity is formed or established, as appropriate, Seller and
Purchaser will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in good
faith with each other to agree upon and implement a commercially reasonable
arrangement between Seller and Purchaser to provide Purchaser the
substantially similar interests, benefits and rights, and subject Purchaser to
the substantially similar obligations and Liabilities, under any such Non-
Assignable Assets (including any Tax obligations related to any such Non-
Assignable Assets) as the applicable Seller had immediately prior to the
Closing, including the actual economic benefit of such Non-Assignable Assets.
In the event that Transferred Assets that are assets provided for in Section
7.1(d)(ii) are prevented from transferring until any such Consent is obtained
or Foreign Acquisition Entity is formed or established, as appropriate, or
until a Purchaser Employee Plan is established and able to receive such
assets, Seller and Purchaser agree that they will cooperate in good faith to
put in place a commercially reasonable solution. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, in the event that all or substantially all of the
Transferred Assets (other than Transferred Assets that are assets provided for
in Section 7.1(d)(ii)) operated in a particular jurisdiction constitute Non-
Assignable Assets, (x) the Employees in such jurisdiction ("Deferred
Employees") shall transfer to Purchaser or one of its Affiliates in accordance
with Article VII on the date substantially all of such Non-Assignable Assets
are assigned to Purchaser (or, if earlier, the date on which a Deferred
Employee's employment automatically transfers to Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates as required by the Acquired Rights) (the "Deferred Employee
Transfer Date") and (y) if necessary to provide the services of such Deferred
Employees prior to the Deferred Employee Transfer Date, Seller and Purchaser
will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in good faith with
each other to agree upon and implement a commercially reasonable arrangement
between Seller and Purchaser to provide Purchaser with the benefit of the
services provided to the Business by the Deferred Employees. Purchaser shall
reimburse the relevant Seller Party in accordance with such agreed upon
arrangements and indemnify and hold each Seller Party harmless from and
against all Liabilities, incurred or asserted, as a result of any actions
taken pursuant to this Section 5.12. The Parties acknowledge that the fact
that any Transferred Asset constitutes a Non-Assignable Asset shall not (1)
constitute a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder, (2)
entitle Purchaser to terminate this Agreement or fail to consummate the
Transactions, (3) result in any reduction of the Purchase Price payable
hereunder or (4) otherwise result in any of Seller having any liability
whatsoever to Purchaser or its Affiliates. Any Non-Assignable Asset assigned
pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.12 shall, when assigned, constitute a
Transferred Asset hereunder from and after such date.

  

  

(b) For the purposes of this Agreement and all representations and warranties
of Seller contained herein, the relevant Seller and the Debtor Subsidiary
Sellers shall be deemed to have obtained all required Consents in respect of
the assignment of any Assigned 365 Debtor Contract if, and to the extent that,
pursuant to the Settlement and Sale Order, Seller and the Debtor Subsidiary
Sellers are authorized to assume and assign (or, in the case of a Shared
Contract, partially assign) to Purchaser such Assigned 365 Debtor Contract
pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and any applicable Cure Costs
have been satisfied as provided in Section 2.1(h).

Section 5.13 Post-Closing Assistance for Litigation.

  

  

(a) After the Closing, Purchaser shall, upon the request of Seller, use
commercially reasonable efforts to require the Transferred Employees to make
themselves reasonably available at reasonable times and cooperate in all
reasonable respects with Seller and its Subsidiaries in the preparation for,
and defense of, any lawsuit, arbitration or other Action (whether disclosed or
not disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule) filed or claimed against
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the respective agents, directors,
officers and employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries, whether currently
pending or asserted in the future, concerning the operation or conduct of the
Business prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that the obligations of
Purchaser hereunder shall extend only to the Transferred Employees who remain
employees of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries as of the date of Seller's request
and shall not apply to former employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries who
have been terminated prior to such date and shall not obligate Purchaser or
its Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any Transferred Employee.
Seller shall reimburse Purchaser and its Affiliates for their reasonable costs
(including allocated costs of employee time) of providing the services
pursuant to this Section 5.13(a).

  

  

(b) After the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, upon
the request of Purchaser, use commercially reasonable efforts to require their
employees that were not Transferred Employees to make themselves reasonably
available and cooperate in all reasonable respects with Purchaser and its
Affiliates in the preparation for, and defense of, any lawsuit, arbitration or
other Action filed or claimed against Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or any
of the respective agents, directors, officers and employees of any of the
foregoing, whether currently pending or asserted in the future, concerning the
operation or conduct of the Business prior to the Closing Date; provided,
however, that the obligations of Seller hereunder shall only extend to the
employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries as of the date of Purchaser's request
and shall not apply to former employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries that
have been terminated prior to such date and shall not obligate Seller or its
Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any such employee. Purchaser shall
reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for their reasonable costs (including
allocated costs of employee time) of providing the services pursuant to this
Section 5.13(b).

  

  

(c) After the Closing, Seller shall, upon the request of Purchaser and at
Purchaser's sole cost and expense, use reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser
documentation and reasonable assistance in asserting a defense in any lawsuit,
arbitration or other Action filed or claimed against Purchaser where such
defense arises from or is based upon a release, license, covenant not to sue
or other right in favor of Seller or its Affiliates that is primarily related
to the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the ownership, use,
function or value of any Transferred Asset or the operation of the Business,
but solely to the extent Purchaser, as a purchaser of the Transferred Assets
or otherwise as the successor-in-interest of Seller in respect of the
Transferred Assets, may benefit from any such release, license, covenant not
to sue or other right without impairing Seller's rights under any such
release, license, covenant not to sue or other right.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5.13,
(i) no Party shall have any obligation pursuant to this Section 5.13 in
connection with any litigation in which the interests of the Parties or their
respective Affiliates are adverse to one another and (ii) nothing herein shall
require any Party or any of its Subsidiaries or employees to disclose any
information to the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries if such disclosure
would jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or contravene
any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or agreement, it being understood that such
first Party shall cooperate in any reasonable efforts and requests for waivers
that would enable otherwise required disclosure to the other Party to occur
without so jeopardizing privilege or contravening such Law, duty or agreement.

Section 5.14 Insurance Matters.

  

  

(a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise provided in
Section 5.14(b), coverage of the Covered Assets and Persons (excluding those
in respect of the Non-Assignable Assets) under Seller Insurance Policies shall
cease as of the Closing and the Covered Assets and Persons will be deleted in
all respects as insured (or additional insured, as the case may be) under all
Seller Insurance Policies.

  

  

(b) After the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
maintain any Directors and Officers Liability insurance policies in place on the
date of this Agreement and or put in place between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date with respect to any Transferred Employee who was a
director or officer of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
Date, with respect to any actions or events occurring prior to the Closing
Date, for a period of six (6) years beginning on the Closing Date.

  

  

(c) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, maintain those workers' compensation
insurance policies in place on the date of this Agreement or put in place
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date with respect to the
Employees.

Section 5.15 Deposits, Guarantees and Other Credit Support of the Business.

  

  

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that in the course of conducting the Business,
Seller and its Affiliates may have entered into various arrangements in which
guarantees, credit support, letters of credit, bonds, cash deposits or similar
arrangements were issued by or on behalf of Seller or its Affiliates in order
to support or facilitate the Business (each, if and solely to the extent
relating to the Business, a "Seller Guarantee" and all such arrangements
collectively, the "Seller Guarantees"). These Seller Guarantees may also be
further supported by cash deposits, collateral assets or other support
arrangements under the DIP Facilities of Seller or its Affiliates or other
lines of credit ("Supporting Collateral"). Purchaser and Seller hereby agree
as follows:

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

Purchaser and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure (a)
the release of the Seller Guarantees set forth on Section 5.15 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule by the applicable counterparty concurrently with the
Closing, or otherwise as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter, and
(b) the release or return to Seller or its applicable Affiliate of all
Supporting Collateral as may be the case (it being understood that under no
circumstances shall Seller or Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates
be required to make any payment in connection with the release of any Seller
Guarantee);

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

with respect to each Seller Guarantee set forth on Section 5.15 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule for which Purchaser or Seller does not obtain a release
and the release or return of all Supporting Collateral, Purchaser and Seller
shall enter into a Hold Harmless Agreement with respect to each such Seller
Guarantee concurrently with the Closing; and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

Purchaser shall not amend, modify or renew any Contract subject to any Seller
Guarantee during the period following the Closing Date without the consent of
Seller in its sole discretion unless, pursuant to or prior to such amendment,
modification or renewal, Seller's and Seller's Affiliates continuing
obligation has been extinguished and neither Seller nor its Affiliates has any
continuing liability thereunder.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Section 5.16 Maintenance of Books and Records.After the Closing, Purchaser
shall preserve or cause to be preserved, until at least the seventh (7th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, all pre-Closing Date records to the extent
relating to the Business possessed or to be possessed by Purchaser or its
Affiliates. After the Closing Date and up until the seventh (7th) anniversary
of the Closing Date, upon any reasonable request from Seller or its
representatives, Purchaser shall, and/or shall cause the Person holding such
records to, provide Seller or its representatives with copies of such records;
provided that in each case Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for its reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with any such
request; provided, however, that nothing herein shall require Purchaser to
disclose any information to Seller (a) in connection with any litigation in
which the interests of the Parties or their respective Affiliates are adverse
to one another or (b) if such disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client
or other legal privilege which Purchaser or its Affiliates is entitled to
claim or contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or agreement (it being
understood that Purchaser shall cooperate in any reasonable efforts and
requests for waivers that would enable otherwise required disclosure to Seller
to occur without so jeopardizing privilege or contravening such Law, duty or
agreement). Such records shall be provided under this Section 5.16 for any
reasonable purpose, including to the extent reasonably required in connection
with accounting, Tax, litigation, federal securities disclosure or other
similar needs of Seller (other than claims between Seller and Purchaser or any
of their respective Affiliates under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) any and all such records may be
destroyed by Purchaser if Purchaser sends to Seller written notice of its
intent to destroy such records, specifying in reasonable detail the contents
of the records to be destroyed; such records may then be destroyed after the
30th day following such notice unless Seller notifies Purchaser that Seller
desires to obtain possession of such records, in which event Purchaser shall
transfer or cause to be transferred the records to Seller and Seller shall pay
all reasonable expenses of Purchaser in connection therewith and (y) Purchaser
shall not be required to provide Seller access to, or copies of, any Tax
records that relate to any Post-Closing Taxable Period.

Section 5.17 Transition Services; Day-One and Separation Planning.

  

  

(a) The Parties acknowledge that the Attachments attached to the form of
Transition Services Agreement contained in Exhibit D reflect a preliminary
list of Transition Services and are not in a final agreed form (such
preliminary attachments, collectively, the "General Scope of Services").
Accordingly, the Parties agree that, from and after the execution of this
Agreement, they will negotiate in good faith to finalize the Transition
Services Agreement and agree on final Attachments to the Transition Services
Agreement prior to the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, prior to
Closing, the Parties shall complete the Services Worksheet for the Transition
Services Agreement, and shall complete the Statement of Work (as defined in
the Transition Services Agreement) for each Transition Service to be provided
under the Transition Services Agreement, including without limitation filling
in the Kodak Transfer Price (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement)
for each such service, in accordance with the principles set forth on
Attachment A to the form of Transition Services Agreement attached to this
Agreement as Exhibit D. In addition, prior to the Closing, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith and agree upon a Reverse Transition Services
Agreement, which shall contemplate the provision of services and support from
the Business to Seller and its Affiliates (the "Reverse Transition Services
Agreement"), and shall complete a Statement of Work (to be defined in the
Reverse Transition Services Agreement) for each service to be provided under
the Reverse Transition Services Agreement, including filling in the Business
Transfer Price (to be defined in the Reverse Transition Services Agreement)
for each such service, in accordance with the principles set forth in this
Section 5.17(a). The Parties agree that all such cooperation and negotiation,
and the finalization of the Transition Services Agreement and the Reverse
Transition Services Agreement will be subject to the following general
principles and conditions:

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

subject to clause (ii) below, (A) the services to be provided under the
Transition Services Agreement (the "Transition Services") will include all
material services and support that have been provided by Seller or its
Affiliates to the Business prior to the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date, other than services contemplated to be excluded on Attachment A to the
form of Transition Services Agreement attached to this Agreement as Exhibit D
and (B) the services to be provided under the Reverse Transition Services
Agreement (the "Reverse Transition Services") will include all material
services and support that have been provided by the Transferred Employees to
Seller or its Affiliates prior to the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Transition Services and the Reverse
Transition Services will not necessarily be limited to the services described
in the General Scope of Services.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

the Transition Services and the Reverse Transition Services will not include
any service the provision of which, in Seller's or Purchaser's reasonable
opinion (as the case may be), would violate any Law;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

the Transition Services and Reverse Transition Services will include all
material services (other than services contemplated to be excluded on
Attachment A to the form of Transition Services Agreement attached to this
Agreement as Exhibit D) reasonably necessary to facilitate the uninterrupted
continuation of the Business, and the business of the applicable Affiliates of
Seller receiving services and support from the Business, and the Transition
Services will not include any service that is not reasonably necessary or
convenient, in Purchaser's reasonable opinion, to permit Purchaser to carry on
the Business after the Closing in a manner materially consistent with the
operation of the Business as at the Closing, and the Reverse Transition
Services will not include any service that is not reasonably necessary or
convenient, in Seller's reasonable opinion, to permit Seller and its
Affiliates to carry on their respective businesses after the Closing in a
manner materially consistent with the operation of such businesses as at the
Closing; and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iv)

  |  

the Reverse Transition Services Agreement shall be on the same terms and
conditions as the Transition Services Agreement (reversed as appropriate),
except to the extent inapplicable in the context of the Reverse Transition
Services Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(b) The Transition Services and the Reverse Transition Services shall be
provided in such manner and pursuant to such terms (including terms and
pricing) as are set forth in the Transition Services Agreement and the Reverse
Transition Services Agreement, respectively.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Closing, if the Seller Parties determine that a Consent (as
such term is defined in Section 2.2 of each of the Transition Services
Agreement and the Reverse Transition Services Agreement) can reasonably be
obtained without unreasonable effort or expense, the Seller Parties shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Consents from Third
Parties, including Third Party service providers, to the extent necessary to
perform and provide the services contemplated under the Transition Services
Agreement and the Reverse Transition Services Agreement.

  

  

(d) In the event of any dispute between the Parties in connection with the
finalization of the Transition Services Agreement or the Reverse Transition
Services Agreement, including the identification and specification of
Transition Services and Reverse Transition Services and completion of the
Attachments and Statements of Work to the Transition Services Agreement or the
Reverse Transition Services Agreement, each Party shall designate a senior
executive or representative reasonably acceptable to the other Party to handle
such dispute and the Parties shall cause such designee(s) to meet as promptly
as practicable and use their respective reasonable best efforts to resolve
such dispute within a reasonable period of time. If such individuals are
unable to resolve the disputes in a timely manner, the Parties shall cooperate
to subject the matters in dispute to a third party mediator or arbitrator
mutually acceptable to the Parties. The senior executives or representatives
designated by the Parties, or any third party designated by the Parties in
connection with the dispute, shall apply the principles set forth in this
Section 5.17, and in the Attachments to the form of Transition Services
Agreement attached to this Agreement as Exhibit D, in resolving any such
disputes.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

84  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

(e) For the purpose of allowing the Purchaser and its representatives to
prepare to consummate the Closing, receive transfer of the Transferred Assets
at Closing and operate the Business immediately upon Closing ("Day One
Readiness"), and for the purpose of allowing the Purchaser and its
representatives to design plans for, and to prepare for, the ultimate
separation of the Business from Seller and the Seller Parties (the
"Separation"), prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Seller
Parties to, upon advance notice and at no cost to Purchaser (i) provide
Purchaser and its authorized representatives reasonable access, during regular
business hours, to senior managers of the Business, functional heads of the
various business lines within the Business and subject matter leads
responsible for various aspects of the Business (collectively, the "Access
Employees"); provided that all meetings or other contact with any of the
Access Employees shall be first coordinated through Garry Hapeman or Mary
Arter (or their designees); provided that such requests for meetings or other
contact shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed, (ii) provide copies of
such books, records, reports, files and other information as reasonably
requested by Purchaser about the Business or that may be necessary or helpful
for Purchaser to prepare for Day One Readiness and/or to design and prepare
for Separation, and (iii) cooperate with Purchaser to develop plans and
timelines for Day-One Readiness and Separation. As soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall mutually agree on a
comprehensive plan for Day-One Readiness, which shall provide a structure and
design for the segregation of the Business from Seller and the Seller Parties
prior to Closing, the purpose of which is intended to ensure the uninterrupted
continuation of the Business at Closing and to enable Purchaser to consummate
the Closing, receive transfer of the Transferred Assets at Closing and operate
the Business immediately upon Closing (the "Day-One Plan"). Each Party shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to implement the tasks contemplated to
be taken by it in the Day-One Plan on the terms and conditions, and within the
scheduled time periods, outlined in the Day-One Plan; provided that the
Parties acknowledge that the time periods set forth in the Day-One Plan may
shift based on various factors that arise after the development of the Day-One
Plan.

  

  

(f) Without limiting the foregoing Sections 5.17(d) and 5.17(e), Purchaser may
from time to time prior to the Closing request that Seller take certain
actions related to Day-One Readiness and/or Separation that would not
otherwise be required to be taken by Seller prior to the Closing under this
Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement ("Day-One Actions"). Seller
will reasonably consider each such request in good faith, and Seller shall not
unreasonably withhold its agreement to perform any Day-One Actions. The
Parties shall cooperate in good faith to determine the nature, cost, payment
terms, duration and scope of such Day-One Actions, and shall enter into a
written statement of work ("SOW") with respect to such Day-One Actions. Each
such SOW shall become effective upon execution by the Parties, and shall be
deemed to be included in and governed by the Transition Services Agreement as
if the Transition Services Agreement were in effect as of the date of the SOW.
If the Parties are unable to mutually agree upon any specific terms of any SOW
for Day-One Actions, such dispute shall be subject to resolution in accordance
with the principles set forth in Section 5.17(d) of this Agreement.

  

  

(g) To the extent that as of the Closing Date, any of the actions,
deliverables or plans contemplated under the Day-One Plan have not been
accomplished, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to design one or more
workaround solutions so as to ensure the uninterrupted continuation of the
Business at Closing and enable Purchaser to consummate the Closing.

  

 

  

Section 5.18 Asset Transfers.Seller shall cause the Transferred Subsidiary to
transfer, assign and deliver to Seller and/or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing the assets set forth in Section 5.17(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule and shall cause the Transferred Subsidiary to terminate and settle as
of the Closing any Intercompany Contract to which the Transferred Subsidiary
is a party, in each case without cost or expense to the Transferred Subsidiary
and without increasing the Liabilities of the Transferred Subsidiary (except
as otherwise agreed in accordance with Section 5.30). For purposes of Article
III (Representations and Warranties of Seller), the representations and
warranties of Seller shall be deemed to be made as though the assets set forth
in Section 5.17(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule were transferred as of
the date of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 5.17(b).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

85  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 5.19 Delivery of Information.

  

  

(a) Current Business Information.

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

Each Seller Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or
cause to be delivered to Purchaser at the Closing all Current Business
Information.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

Seller shall at or prior to the date that all Transition Services have
concluded, deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser any Current Business
Information not provided pursuant to clause (i).

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(b) Historic Business Information. During the term of the Transition Services
Agreement:

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser Historic Business
Information with a Record Age of less than five years and that are reasonably
requested by Purchaser, provided that such Historic Business Information can
be identified using commercially reasonable means, and Purchaser shall
reimburse Seller for its reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such
delivery.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

The Parties shall confer in good faith in respect of any reasonable request
for Historic Business Information with a Record Age of five years or more.
Seller may, in its reasonable discretion, refuse any such request. If Seller
agrees to deliver the requested information, Seller shall, in its sole
discretion, determine the manner and timing of any such delivery, and
Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for its expenses incurred in connection with
such delivery.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

Before beginning any work to deliver requested information under this 5.19(b),
Seller shall provide Purchaser with an estimate of the expenses Seller
anticipates it will incur in fulfilling Purchaser's request for Historic
Business Information. Seller shall not proceed with any such work until
Purchaser has acknowledged receipt of the estimate and authorized Seller to
proceed with such work in writing. If after receiving Seller's estimate
Purchaser does not provide such written authorization, Seller will be excused
from any obligation to fulfill Purchaser's request.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(c) Nothing in this Agreement will obligate Seller to deliver or cause to be
delivered Business Information with a Record Age greater than seven (7) years.

  

  

(d) Cooperation. With respect to Current Business Information and Historic
Business Information stored in Shared Systems, after the date hereof, the
Parties will confer and determine in good faith how to transfer (or provide
access to transfer) such records to Purchaser, including determining which
Party is best positioned to extract such records after Closing and agreeing on
reasonable formats to be used for extracts of such records and reasonable
timeframes for delivery thereof by Seller to Purchaser in a manner that allows
Purchaser to operate the Business in the Ordinary Course. The Parties will
cooperate to ensure all such records are delivered to Purchaser at or prior to
the date that all Transition Services have concluded.

  

  

(e) Combined Records.

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and solely with
respect to Combined Records, Seller reserves the right to redact or withhold
from the delivery of any Combined Record otherwise required to be delivered
pursuant to this Section 5.19 any information (A) the disclosure of which to
Purchaser would cause Seller or any of its Affiliates to be in breach of a
written or legal obligation of confidentiality to a Third Party in respect of
such information (such information, "Third Party Confidential Information"),
or (B) Seller considers in good faith to be competitively sensitive in its
reasonable judgment (together with Third Party Confidential Information,
collectively, "Sensitive Information"). Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser
of any such determination.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

Seller shall, on a confidential basis, make such Combined Records that it
believes contains Sensitive Information available for examination, at
Purchaser's expense, by Purchaser's outside counsel such that Purchaser's
outside counsel may evaluate Seller's determination in respect of such
Combined Records. If Purchaser\'s outside counsel believes such a Combined
Record does not contain Sensitive Information, Seller and Purchaser shall
resolve such dispute through the dispute resolution process set forth in the
Transition Services Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

If Purchaser does not cause its outside counsel to review such Combined
Records, or if Purchaser's outside counsel agrees with Seller's determination:
(A) if Seller can withhold or redact Sensitive Information expending de
minimis effort and for de minimis cost, or if Purchaser otherwise agrees to a
method of removal or redaction of such Sensitive Information proposed by
Seller, then Seller shall deliver the Combined Records with such Sensitive
Information so redacted or removed; (B) if Seller cannot remove or redact such
Sensitive Information expending de minimis effort and for de minimis cost, (1)
Purchaser shall pay Seller's costs incurred in removing or redacting such
Sensitive Information, or (2) in the case of Third Party Confidential
Information, Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
secure the consent of the applicable Third Party or Third Parties (including
Government Entities as required by Law) to allow Seller to disclose such Third
Party Confidential Information.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iv)

  |  

If Purchaser is unwilling to pay Seller's costs incurred in removing or
redacting such Sensitive Information, or if Seller and Purchaser are unable to
secure the necessary consents to disclose such Third Party Confidential
Information, then Seller will be excused from any obligation to fulfill
Purchaser's request with respect to the affected Combined Records.

Person other than Purchaser and/or its Affiliates Manufacturing Line 293 in

faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on an equitable
allocation of the benefits resulting from the resolution of such claim.

Section 5.25 Real Property.This Section 5.25 is intended to specifically
describe the documentation and other matters related to the transfer,
separation and other occupancy rights to be provided to Purchaser with respect
to the Transferred Real Property, the Real Property subject to Real Property
Leases, the Shared Sites, the KEPS Plant, the Rochester Sites and the Harrow
Facility. It is understood and agreed that any Real Property owned or leased
by the Transferred Subsidiary will be transferred to Purchaser pursuant to the
transfer of the Transferred Subsidiary.

  

  

(a) Transferred Real Property. Each Transferred Real Property (i) is Real
Property that is owned by Seller or an Other Seller for use primarily in
connection with the Business and (ii) will be transferred by Seller to
Purchaser at the Closing pursuant to the applicable documents to be delivered
pursuant to Sections 2.4(e) and 2.5(b).

  

  

(b) Real Property Subject to Real Property Leases. Each Real Property Lease
(i) relates to Real Property that is leased by Seller or an Other Seller for
use primarily in connection with the Business and (ii) will be assigned by
Seller to Purchaser at the Closing pursuant to the applicable documents to be
delivered pursuant to Sections 2.4(e) and 2.5(b).

  

  

(c) Shared Sites.

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

With respect to each Shared Site, Seller or an Other Seller, on the one hand,
and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall enter into a Shared Site Agreement to
provide Purchaser with the right to use such Shared Site to operate the
Business in substantially the same manner as the Business was operated at such
Shared Site prior to Closing, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

To the extent that any Shared Site is required by applicable Law to be
physically separated in order to enter into a Shared Site Agreement, then
Seller shall (and shall cause the Other Sellers, as applicable, to) and
Purchaser shall cooperate promptly and in good faith to reasonably agree on a
separation plan for such property. Seller shall pay all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with any such physical separation.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

With respect to each Shared Site, from and after the date hereof and prior to
the Closing, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to determine if such
Shared Site should be excluded from the transactions contemplated hereunder.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(d) KEPS Plant.

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

The Parties acknowledge that the KEPS Plant is part of a Real Property that is
material to the Business and that the consideration paid by Purchaser
hereunder was calculated on the basis that the KEPS Plant will be subleased to
Purchaser or one or more Purchaser Assigns on or after the Closing. Applicable
Law or the relevant Real Property Lease prohibits the subletting of the KEPS
Plant to Purchaser or one or more Purchaser Assigns upon the Closing without
obtaining all Consents required therefor. Accordingly, the Parties are
intending to either (A) mutually agree on a sublease (on terms and conditions
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser) for the KEPS Plant to Purchaser, one or
more Purchaser Assigns or the Transferred Subsidiary at or prior to the
Closing or (B) enter into the KEPS Equipment Supply Agreement until such time
as Seller obtains all necessary Consents to sublease the KEPS Plant to
Purchaser. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall undertake to physically separate
the KEPS Plant to provide the Business with its own separate space therein.
All reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred with respect to such
physical separation shall be shared equally as between Seller and Purchaser.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

If the KEPS Plant cannot be subleased at Closing, then from and after the
Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the applicable Other Seller to (i)
operate and maintain the KEPS Plant in accordance with this Agreement,
including Section 5.7, as if this Agreement survived the Closing with respect
to the KEPS Plant and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary Consents and Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller with respect
thereto. Promptly after Seller's receipt of all such Consents, the Parties
shall execute, deliver and file all documents, and take all other actions
necessary, to consummate such sublease of the KEPS Plant.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

The Parties acknowledge and agree that all sublease documents shall provide,
among other things, that: (A) Purchaser shall have the right to exercise or
cause the exercise of any extension options provided for under the lease
applicable to the KEPS Plant if Purchaser also elects to extend such sublease;
and (B) the rental amount for the KEPS Plant, which shall be negotiated by the
Parties in good faith prior to Closing and shall be based on Seller's actual,
out-of-pocket costs and expenses related to the real estate costs attributable
to the Business at the KEPS Plant (it being expressly understood that any
utilities and other real estate costs of the Business will either (1) be
directly billed to Purchaser or (2) be included in the rent amount based on
Purchaser's appropriate share thereof). This Section 5.25(d) shall survive the
Closing.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(e) Rochester Sites. Seller shall grant to Purchaser the right to use the
Rochester Sites pursuant to the Rochester Leases at the Closing. The Rochester
Leases are in final agreed form in the form attached hereto as Exhibit HH and
shall be executed by Seller and Purchaser at the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that, prior to Closing, Purchaser obtains a fair
market analysis of gross rental amounts for the office space within the
Rochester, New York area that reflects that the rental stated in the form of
Rochester Leases is above fair market rent, the Parties shall negotiate in
good faith to reduce the rental amounts provided in the Rochester Leases to be
commensurate with such fair market rent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

91  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) Harrow Facility.

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

Seller shall use its good faith efforts to obtain the consent of Land
Securities to transfer the Harrow Facility to Purchaser or its assigns,
subject to the agreements between Seller and Land Securities. In addition,
Seller shall use its good faith efforts to obtain the consent of Land
Securities to allow Purchaser or its assigns to transfer or lease the Harrow
Facility through 2032, subject to the agreements between Seller and Land
Securities. If such consent is obtained, the Harrow Facility shall be
considered a Transferred Real Property and not an Excluded Real Property for
all purposes hereunder.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

If a Seller is unable to obtain Land Securities' consent to such transfer
prior to Closing, the Parties shall enter into the Harrow Lease at Closing and
Seller shall use its good faith efforts to obtain the consent of Land
Securities to permit Purchaser or its assigns, to be entitled to (A) assign
the Harrow Lease to any purchaser of the Business conducted thereat (or permit
a change of control of the tenant under the Harrow Lease) and (B) extend the
term of the Harrow Lease. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Harrow
Lease shall be excluded from sections 24 to 28 of the Landlord and Tenant Act
1954 (2 and 3 Eliz 2 c 56).

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

The Parties acknowledge and agree that the business understanding for the
Harrow Facility is that Purchaser shall have all benefits and burdens of the
ownership thereof, including: (A) the right to receive or retain any profits
obtained by any Seller Party or Purchaser upon the sale or transfer of the
Harrow Facility, together with any funds received under any overage agreement
or other uplift with respect to the Harrow Facility itself and any other real
property transferred to Land Securities pursuant to the agreements between
Seller and Land Securities; provided, however, in determining profits only
those reasonable costs and expenses incurred after the Closing with respect to
the Harrow Facility shall be deducted; (B) control over the transfer and/or
operation of the Harrow Facility (including any works (including demolition)
required prior to any sale and/or transfer); and (C) if and when possible, a
transfer of the freehold interest in the Harrow Facility (and the Real
Property associated therewith) to Purchaser for no additional consideration.
Accordingly, if the Harrow Lease is entered into at Closing (rather than a
transfer of the Harrow Facility to Purchaser), the Parties shall also enter
into a separate agreement at Closing to reflect the business understanding set
forth in the foregoing sentence.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(g) Real Property Used by Seller Post-Closing. The Seller Parties have
requested that, for a transitional period following the Closing, the
applicable Seller Party shall have the right to use a portion of each Real
Property set forth on Section 5.25(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (each,
a "Leaseback Site") in substantially the same manner as such Seller Party was
operating at such Leaseback Site prior to Closing, and Purchaser is willing to
provide such transitional use of the Leaseback Sites pursuant to the terms of
this Section 5.25(g).

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

With respect to each Leaseback Site, Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller,
on the other hand, shall enter into an agreement (each, a "Leaseback
Agreement") on the same terms and conditions as set forth in the Shared Site
Agreement Term Sheet, except: (A) Purchaser shall be the "Grantor" and such
Seller Party shall be the "Grantee"; (B) the size of the space to be used by
such Seller Party shall be reasonably agreed to by the Parties prior to
Closing, (C) the Rent payable by the applicable Seller Party to Purchaser
shall be equal to the product of (x) Purchaser's actual, out-of-pocket costs
and expenses related to the operation of such Leaseback Site and (y) such
Seller Party's proportionate share of the total size of such Leaseback Site,
which shall expressly include such Seller Party's proportionate share of any
vacant space in such Leaseback Site as of the Closing; (D) to the extent that
any Leaseback Site is required by applicable Law to be physically separated in
order to enter into such Leaseback Agreement, then Grantee shall pay all costs
and expenses incurred in connection therewith; (E) the section entitled
"Cooperation" shall be deleted in its entirety; (F) all other sections of the
Shared Site Agreement Term Sheet shall be deemed modified to remove any
provisions that are not applicable.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

To the extent that any Leaseback Site is required by applicable Law to be
physically separated in order to enter into any such Leaseback Agreement, then
Seller shall (and shall cause the Other Sellers, as applicable, to) and
Purchaser shall cooperate promptly and in good faith to reasonably agree on a
separation plan for such property. Seller shall pay all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with any such physical separation.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

In the event Seller does not obtain the necessary consents of Third Parties to
any such Leaseback Agreement, then Purchaser shall not be obligated to enter
into such Leaseback Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(h) Negotiation of Real Property Closing Documents. The Parties acknowledge
that the documents necessary to effectuate the intent of this Section 5.25
(the "Real Property Closing Documents"), including the Shared Site Agreements,
are not in a final agreed form (other than the Rochester Leases). Accordingly,
the Parties agree that, from and after the execution of this Agreement, they
will negotiate in good faith to reasonably agree on the Real Property Closing
Documents reasonably acceptable to the Parties prior to the Closing. With
respect to the Shared Site Agreements, the Parties agree that such
negotiation, and the use the Shared Sites by Purchaser, will be subject to the
terms and conditions set forth on Exhibit Q. In all cases, the Real Property
Closing Documents shall in no way expand the obligations of Purchaser beyond
those expressly set forth in this Agreement (including the Exhibits attached
hereto).

  

  

(i) Consents for Real Property Closing Documents. The Seller Parties shall
give all notices to, and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all
Consents from, all Third Parties necessary to authorize the applicable Seller
Party to enter into, execute and deliver the Real Property Closing Documents
and, in connection therewith, the Seller Parties shall request that the
applicable Third Party agree to any subsequent transfer of the applicable Real
Property Lease or Shared Site Agreement to a purchaser of the Business,
including through a change of control of Purchaser or its assigns. In the
event the Seller Parties are unable to obtain the necessary Consents to
authorize the execution and delivery of the Real Property Closing Documents

written request by providing written notice thereof to the other Party and
specifying in detail the basis for its objection (such notice, an "Dispute

Asset, as the case may be, in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence of this Section 5.26, then the Parties shall reasonably cooperate
with each other in the resolution of such dispute, and if such dispute is not

(a) After the date of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate
promptly and in good faith to finalize in definitive form each of the

agreement is attached to this Agreement as an Exhibit, the definitive form of
such Ancillary Agreement to be executed and delivered by the applicable
parties thereto at Closing shall be in such form as attached to this
Agreement, with only such ministerial additions, deletions and modifications
as necessary to complete any missing terms contemplated by the form to be
completed by the parties to the Ancillary Agreement or to correct any
scrivener's error in the form of Ancillary Agreement. With respect to each
Ancillary Agreement for which a summary of principal terms or term sheet is
attached to this Agreement as an Exhibit (each a "Term Sheet Agreement"), the
definitive form of such Ancillary Agreement to be executed and delivered by
the applicable parties at Closing shall be on the terms and conditions set
forth in such Exhibit and shall contain such other terms and conditions as are
reasonably agreed between the Parties or required by applicable Law. Section
5.25(h) shall further apply to the preparation and negotiation of any
Ancillary Agreements that are Real Property Closing Documents.

  

  

(b) After the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, at the
request of Purchaser or Seller, respectively, Seller or Purchaser,
respectively, shall discuss and negotiate in good faith with the requesting
Party the terms and conditions proposed by the requesting Party of any
commercial agreements (in addition to the Ancillary Agreements) for the supply
of goods or services between the Seller Parties and Purchaser necessary to
maintain the continuity of the operations of the Business and the Commercial
Imaging Business following the Closing as a result of the separation of the
Business and the Commercial Imaging Business pursuant to the Transactions
(collectively, the "Additional Commercial Agreements"). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Seller Parties and Purchaser acknowledge that
the foregoing obligation is an obligation to discuss and negotiate in good
faith and is not an obligation to enter into any proposed commercial agreement
or to agree to any particular terms and conditions of any proposed commercial
agreement.

  

  

(c) If the Parties are unable to reach agreement on a material term or
condition of a Term Sheet Agreement (to the extent not already set forth in
the Exhibit for such Term Sheet Agreement attached to this Agreement) or of an
Additional Commercial Agreement, then each Party shall designate a senior
executive or representative reasonably acceptable to the other Party to handle
such dispute and the Parties shall cause such designees to meet as promptly as
practicable and use their respective reasonable best efforts to resolve such
dispute within a reasonable period of time. Any Additional Commercial
Agreements shall be executed and delivered contemporaneously with the Closing,
together with the other Ancillary Agreements.

Section 5.30 Structure of Sale of the Transferred Subsidiary.

  

  

(a) Structure of Sale. The Parties acknowledge that as of the date hereof they
have agreed to structure the sale of the Business of the Transferred
Subsidiary to Purchaser as the sale of the stock in the Transferred Subsidiary
to Purchaser or one or more Purchaser Assigns but have not reached an
understanding on how to deal with the assets related to the printhead
refurbishment business and with the cash and cash items (in the total amount
of $57.4 million, as of March 31, 2013) currently owned by the Transferred
Subsidiary, which (notwithstanding Section 2.1(c)) are not part of the assets
of the Business and were not taken into account in determining the Purchase
Price for the Business (the "KWCL Cash"). The Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to determine the structure of the transfer to Purchaser of the Business
of the Transferred Subsidiary, including whether to structure it instead as a
transfer or lease of the assets and assumption of the liabilities of the
Transferred Subsidiary to and by Purchaser. The Parties acknowledge that the
assets of the Transferred Subsidiary (other than the KWCL Cash) are an
important part of the Business and shall be included in the transfer of the
Business hereunder to Purchaser. The Parties agree that Purchaser will not be
required to increase the Cash Price as a result of such structuring. The
Parties also agree that in the event the Transfer of the Transferred
Subsidiary is structured other than as a sale of the stock in the Transferred
Subsidiary to Purchaser or one or more Purchaser Assigns and, as a result,
Purchaser or such Purchaser Assign is to bear more Transfer Taxes (other than
Recoupable Transfer Taxes) ("Additional Transfer Taxes"), the Transferred
Subsidiary shall reimburse the Purchaser Assigns in RMB for the Additional
Transfer Taxes. The Parties further agree that in structuring this transfer,
Seller shall be entitled to retain the benefit of the KWCL Cash and that the
Purchase Price and the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule did not take the
printhead refurbishment assets and the KWCL Cash into account. If it is agreed
that the land and building that is part of the Business will be leased to the
Purchaser or one or more Purchaser Assigns, the Parties agree that the
purchase price allocated to KWCL and to Seller may be adjusted to reflect such
change, but that the overall Purchase Price will not change. To the extent
that it is agreed to structure the transfer of the Transferred Subsidiary
other than as a sale of the stock in the Transferred Subsidiary to Purchaser
or one or more Purchaser Assigns, subject to the foregoing provisions relating
to Transfer Taxes, the provisions of this Agreement with respect to the
transfer of the Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities will apply mutatis
mutandis to the transferred assets and assumed liabilities of the Transferred
Subsidiary, and the special provisions in Article VI and Section 6.5(b)
applicable only to the Transferred Subsidiary and Section 6.1(a) shall not
apply (and, instead, the other provisions of such Article VI shall apply).

  

  

(b) Tax Filings in the PRC. The Parties shall cooperate and negotiate in good
faith before the Closing Date commercially reasonable time frames for making
any applicable Tax payments to the Chinese Tax Authorities and for filing any
applicable Tax returns with the Chinese Tax Authorities with respect to the
Transferred Subsidiary.

Article VI 
 

  

  

TAX MATTERS

  

  

Section 6.1 Transfer Taxes.

  

  

(a) All applicable Transfer Taxes that are not Recoupable Transfer Taxes and
that may be imposed upon (or payable, collectible or incurred in connection
with) this Agreement, the Transactions or the execution of any of the
Ancillary Agreements (unless otherwise provided in the Ancillary Agreement)
shall be borne one-half by the Seller Parties, on the one hand, and one-half
by Purchaser, on the other hand.

  

  

(b) Any Recoupable Transfer Tax shall be borne solely by Purchaser and if such
Tax is required by applicable Law to be accounted for by a Seller Party,
Purchaser shall pay the amount of such Tax to such Seller Party on the later
of the day one Business Day before the last day on which the Seller Party can
account for that Tax to the Tax Authority without giving rise to a charge to
interest or penalties and five (5) Business Days after the relevant Seller
Party has provided to Purchaser all relevant invoices or other relevant
documentation which are required by applicable Law in order to claim a refund,
credit or recoupment in respect of such Recoupable Transfer Tax. If any such
invoices or documentation are to be provided by the relevant Seller Party,
Seller shall provide or cause the Seller Party to provide any such invoices
and documentation within the time period required by applicable Law.

  

  

(c) The Seller Parties and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate in good faith
to minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any
Transfer Taxes addressed in Sections 6.1(a) and (b) including taking any steps
reasonably necessary (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any
action that would impose any unreimbursed cost, loss or Liability on the
Seller Parties or transferring any additional assets or providing additional
services (other than assistance in dealing with a Tax Authority) which are not
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements) to ensure that,
where possible, the transfer of any parts of the Business are treated as a
transfer of a going concern for value added tax purposes. Each Transfer Tax
Return shall be prepared by the Party that has primary responsibility for
filing such Transfer Tax Return pursuant to the applicable Tax Laws. Any
Transfer Tax Returns prepared by either Purchaser or Seller Parties pursuant
to this Section 6.1(c) (along with such information as will enable the other
Party to review such Transfer Tax Returns) shall be provided to the relevant
Party at least 20 Business Days before such Transfer Tax Returns are due to be
filed or such shorter period as is reasonable after the end of the period to
which the Tax Return relates having regard to the date on which the Tax Return
is due to be filed (taking into account any extensions received from the
relevant Tax Authorities) if the other Party is or may be accountable for any
part of such Transfer Tax filed vis-a-vis the Party responsible for the
filing. Purchaser and the Seller Parties shall be entitled to comment on any
Transfer Tax Return prepared by the other Party prior to making any payment in
respect thereof, such comments to be provided at least 13 Business Days (or
such shorter period as is reasonable having regard to the date on which the
Tax Return is due to be filed) before such Transfer Tax Returns are due to be
filed, and in the event of disagreement on the relevant Tax Return between the
Parties, a mutually agreed upon independent internationally recognized
accounting firm will be retained to resolve solely any issue in dispute as
promptly as possible. To the extent there are still disagreements between the
Parties on the due date for filing the Tax Return, the Person responsible for
filing the Tax Return shall file it based on what it considers to be the
correct reporting, and if the determination of the independent accounting firm
(or any agreement between the Parties) is inconsistent with the filed Tax
Return, the Parties agree to file an amended return reflecting such
determination or agreement. If Purchaser pays any amount in respect of value
added tax to a Seller Party and the Tax Authority confirms that all or part of
it was not properly chargeable, the Seller Party must repay the amount or
relevant part of it to Purchaser. The Seller Party must make the repayment
promptly after the confirmation, unless it has already accounted to the Tax
Authority for the VAT. In those circumstances, the Seller Party must apply for
a refund of the VAT (plus any interest payable by the Tax Authority), use its
reasonable endeavours to obtain it as quickly as practicable, and pay to
Purchaser the amount of the refund and any interest less any tax on the Seller
Party in respect of such interest when and to the extent received from the Tax
Authority.

  

  

Section 6.2 Withholding Taxes.(a) To the extent that Purchaser is required
under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local, or non-U.S. Law to
deduct and withhold Taxes on any payment hereunder, Purchaser shall withhold
and deduct from the Cash Price such required Tax withholdings, and such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Persons in respect of which such deductions and withholdings
were made. Purchaser shall promptly remit any withheld amounts to the
appropriate Tax Authority and shall promptly provide Seller with a receipt or
some other form of reasonable evidence of such remittance. The Parties shall
use commercially reasonable efforts and shall cooperate in good faith to
determine and reduce the amount of withholding Taxes imposed on the
transaction, including the provision by Seller or Seller Parties to Purchaser
of any reasonable form necessary for that purpose. Seller shall promptly
provide Purchaser with any information reasonably requested by Purchaser in
order to determine the amount of tax (if any) required by Law to be withheld
by Purchaser or its Affiliates from the Purchase Price.

  

  

(b) No later than 45 days after the date hereof (provided that Seller has
complied with the last sentence of Section 6.2(a)), Purchaser shall provide
Seller with a reasonably detailed good faith estimate (the "Withholding Tax
Estimate") of all withholding Taxes required to be withheld from the Purchase
Price. Seller and Purchaser agree to consult and try to resolve in good faith
any disputes related to such estimate. For the avoidance of doubt, however,
the rights and obligations of the Parties pursuant to Section 6.2(a) shall not
be affected by the existence or amount of any inaccuracy in such estimate. In
case the Parties are unable to reach an understanding on the amount of
withholding tax, and there is a subsequent determination (as defined in
Section 1313 of the Code, or any other similar Law) that any amount of tax
should not have been withheld by Purchaser or its Affiliates, Purchaser shall
be responsible to indemnify the Seller Parties for any reasonable out of
pocket costs incurred by the Seller Parties in obtaining such determination
(but only to the extent of the amount of such costs allocable to the
withholding tax that was disputed between the Parties).

Section 6.3 Proration of Certain Taxes.

  

  

(a) All real and personal property Taxes or similar ad valorem Taxes (other
than Transfer Taxes) levied with respect to the Transferred Assets for any
taxable period that includes the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date
(a "Straddle Period"), whether imposed or assessed before or after the Closing
Date, shall be allocated ratably to the period that ends on and includes the
Closing Date (which shall be the responsibility of Seller), and the period
that begins after the Closing Date (which shall be the responsibility of
Purchaser) based on the number of days in the Straddle Period that are
included in each period. All other Taxes (other than Taxes allocated under
Section 6.1 and Taxes specially allocated under Sections 6.3(b) and (c)),
shall be determined on a closing of the books method, as through the taxable
period terminated at Closing, and allocated to Seller to the extent
attributable to a pre-Closing period and to Purchaser to the extent
attributable to a post-Closing period. Seller shall have the responsibility to
file and remit any Tax Returns with respect to any Pre-Closing Taxable Period
and Purchaser shall have the responsibility to file and remit any Tax Return
with respect to a Straddle Period and the Party responsible for filing such
Tax Return shall provide a copy of the Tax Return to the other Party for
approval at least 20 days in advance of the due date for the filing and
remitting of any Taxes due thereon if the other Party is or may be accountable
for any part of such Tax filed or remitted vis-a-vis the Party responsible for
the filing or remission in accordance with this Section 6.3(a). The Parties
shall not unreasonably withhold their approval with respect to any such
required Tax Returns.

  

  

(b) With respect to all invoices for accounts receivables issued by a Seller
Party prior to the Closing and all invoices for accounts payable received by a
Seller Party prior to the Closing, the Seller Party shall retain the legal
obligation to report and make any related payments to the relevant Tax
Authorities for the related value added Tax outputs and value added Tax
inputs. With respect to all such invoices for accounts receivable and invoices
for accounts payable that are transferred to or assumed by Purchaser pursuant
to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, the parties recognize that
Purchaser will be collecting the related value added Tax outputs from the
customers and making payment of the related value added Tax inputs to the
vendors. Accordingly, 30 days following the Closing, and every 30 days
thereafter, the parties shall determine the net amount received or net amount
paid by Purchaser in respect of such value added Tax outputs and value added
Tax inputs, and if there is a net amount received, Purchaser shall pay that
amount to Seller, and if there is a net amount paid, Seller shall pay that
amount to Purchaser. It is the intent of this Section 6.3(b) that neither
Seller nor Purchaser is economically benefitted or economically disadvantaged
as a result of the value added Tax components of accounts receivables and
account payables that relate to invoices issued prior to the Closing but which
are collected or satisfied following the Closing.

  

  

(c) The Parties will apply principles similar to those in Section 6.3(b) in
the case of any other similar Taxes (including sales Taxes) that are (i) the
legal obligation of a Seller Party but that are components of accounts
receivable or (ii) creditable or refundable to Seller but that are components
of accounts payable that are transferred to or assumed by Purchaser, in each
case, pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement and that would be
collected or satisfied following the Closing. To avoid double counting,
following the determination of the Closing Adjusted Working Capital and the
Reference Adjusted Working Capital under Section 2.6(f), such adjustments
shall be made to any payments made under 6.3(b) and 6.3(c) so as to take into
account the net cash effect of the embedded amounts of indirect Taxes (of the
type subject to netting under Sections 6.3(b) and 6.3(c)) which are included
in the calculation of the payment under Section 2.6(f).

  

  

Section 6.4 Allocation of the Purchase Price.

  

  

(a) For all purposes, the Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Seller
Parties in accordance with Section 6.4(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
(the "Purchase Price Allocation Schedule"), or as Purchaser and Seller may
otherwise reasonably agree.

  

  

(b) No later than 120 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare in
good faith and shall deliver to Seller a schedule, prepared consistently with
the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and the working capital adjustment,
allocating the Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities as of the Closing
Date to the Seller Parties and to the Transferred Assets and the Trademark
License Agreements (the "Initial Allocation"). Purchaser shall promptly
provide Seller with any reasonably requested information requested by Seller
for purposes of reviewing the Initial Allocation. Except as set forth below,
the Initial Allocation shall become final and be binding upon Purchaser and
the Seller Parties for all purposes of Tax reporting, provided, however, that
if Seller disagrees with the Initial Allocation and Seller notifies Purchaser
in writing of its disagreements within 60 days after having received the
Initial Allocation, such Initial Allocation shall not become final and Seller
and Purchaser agree to consult and resolve in good faith any disputed item. In
the event the Parties are unable to resolve any such dispute within 30 days
(or such other period as mutually agreed by the Parties) following the written
notice to Purchaser of Seller's objection, a mutually agreed upon independent
nationally recognized accounting firm will be retained to resolve solely any
issue in dispute as promptly as possible by deciding whether the valuation and
related allocation of Purchaser or Seller is more consistent with applicable
Law, and the determination of such firm shall be final with respect to such
disputed issues. Purchaser and Seller shall then be bound by the Initial
Allocation as adjusted to reflect the determination of such independent
accounting firm and shall bear equally all costs of the independent accounting
firm (the Initial Allocation, as finally determined under this Section 6.4(b),
the "Final Allocation").

  

  

(c) The Initial Allocation and the Final Allocation shall be prepared in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and any similar applicable foreign
law. Any Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated to the Seller Party whose
liability was assumed. The Initial Allocation and the Final Allocation shall
be adjusted to reflect any changes in the Purchase Price and the Assumed
Liabilities (including as a result of the payment of any indemnity or the
working capital adjustment) under the principles set forth above.
Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, if a different
allocation is required by the Bankruptcy Court, then the Initial Allocation
and Final Allocation shall be modified as necessary to be consistent with such
different allocation.

  

  

(d) Except as otherwise required by any determination (as defined under
Section 1313 of the Code or similar provision of applicable law), the Parties
agree (i) to be bound by the Final Allocation, and (ii) to act in accordance
with the allocations contained in such Final Allocation for all purposes
relating to Taxes and Transfer Taxes addressed in Section 6.1, including the
preparation and filing of any Tax Returns and paying any Tax due thereon. The
Parties acknowledge that some Transfer Tax Returns may be required to be filed
prior to the determination of the Final Allocation. Therefore, if any Transfer
Tax Return is required to be filed before the Final Allocation has been
determined, the Parties agree to prepare and file such Tax Return consistently
with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and to negotiate in good faith the
amount of the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities (if relevant) allocated
to each asset subject to Transfer Taxes. If, as of the due date for filing the
Transfer Tax Return, any disagreements exist between the Parties on the amount
that should be allocated to the relevant assets, the party responsible under
law to file such Tax Return shall prepare such Tax Return consistently with
what it considers to be the correct allocation, and to the extent that the
Final Allocation is inconsistent with such allocation, to thereafter file
amended Transfer Tax Returns consistent with the Final Allocation.

Section 6.5 Tax Indemnity.

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Article VI, (i) Seller shall be
liable for, and shall indemnify Purchaser and the Transferred Subsidiary
against and hold them harmless from, (A) all (I) Taxes of the Transferred
Subsidiary (including any such liability imposed on the Transferred Subsidiary
by virtue of being a member of an affiliated group that includes Seller and
any Taxes arising as a result of the separation from any such affiliated
group), and (II) Taxes of any kind relating to the Transferred Assets and the
conduct or operation of the Business, in each case, for all Tax periods or
portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, including any Straddle
Period for which Seller is allocated a tax liability, (B) Taxes of the Seller
Parties for any period that are not related to the Transferred Assets or the
conduct or operation of the Business, and (C) Transfer Taxes that are the
responsibility of the Seller Parties pursuant to Section 6.1 and (ii)
Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall indemnify Seller and the Other
Sellers against and hold them harmless from, (A) all (I) Taxes of the
Transferred Subsidiary and (II) Taxes relating to the Transferred Assets or
the conduct or operation of the Business, in each case, for all Tax periods or
portions thereof beginning after the Closing Date and (B) Transfer Taxes that
are the responsibility of Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.1. The apportionment
of Taxes for Straddle Periods shall be governed by Section 6.3. For the
avoidance of doubt, transactions outside the ordinary course of business that
occur on the Closing Date but after the Closing shall be treated for purposes
of this Section 6.5 as occurring on the day immediately following the Closing
Day. A Party shall not be required to pay the other Party an indemnity under
this Section to the extent of Losses to such other Party or any of its
Affiliates that were caused or increased by any action of such other Party or
any of its Affiliates.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, (i) the current
Taxes of the Transferred Subsidiary shall not be excluded from "Current
Liabilities", and the current Tax assets of the Transferred Subsidiary shall
not be excluded from "Current Assets", (ii) Seller and the Other Sellers shall
not be responsible for any liability, accrual or reserve for Taxes that are
Current Liabilities of the Transferred Subsidiary or Taxes that accrued after
December 31, 2012, except for any Taxes of the Transferred Subsidiary which
arise outside the ordinary course of business of such Transferred Subsidiary
between December 31, 2012 and the Closing Date and (iii) Section 6.3(b) shall
not apply to any value added taxes (and similar other taxes) of the
Transferred Subsidiary (for the avoidance of doubt, after Closing, the
Transferred Subsidiary and Purchaser shall be entitled to any value added tax
collected from the customers and responsible for any value added tax paid to
vendors, and shall be solely responsible to pay the Tax Authorities the value
added tax taken into account in Current Liabilities and retain any credit or
refund for value added taxes taken into account in Current Assets). For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.5(b) shall relieve Seller of its
obligation under Section 6.5(a) to indemnify Purchaser for any Taxes of a
Transferred Subsidiary for Taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or
before December 31, 2012 and that do not appear on the Balance Sheet of The
Transferred Subsidiary as of December 31, 2012 or for any Taxes of the
Transferred Subsidiary which arise outside the ordinary course of business of
such Transferred Subsidiary between December 31, 2012 and the Closing Date.
Likewise, Purchaser shall promptly pay Seller any amount of refund of Taxes
(or credit or offset against Taxes) in respect of Tax periods or portions
thereof ending on or before December 31, 2012 that is received by a
Transferred Subsidiary.

  

  

Section 6.6 Contests; Assistance and Cooperation.Purchaser and Seller agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Business, the
Transferred Assets and the Transferred Subsidiary (including access to books
and records, employees, contractors and representatives) as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns (including, if applicable, full
details of any capital goods to be transferred to Purchaser, the input VAT on
which could be subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of any
Law requiring adjustments to the deduction of input VAT on capital goods, the
dates and amounts of input VAT recovered in respect of these assets and the
relevant VAT correction periods), the making of any election related to Taxes,
the preparation for any audit by any Tax Authority, and the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax; provided,
however, that if such requested information is contained within a document
containing any unrelated information, only portions pertaining to such
relevant information shall be furnished. The requesting party shall pay the
other party any reasonable Third Party out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
other party in providing such assistance. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
herein shall give Purchaser or Seller the right to see any consolidated or
combined Tax Return that includes any Seller Party or Purchaser or any
information unrelated to the Business or the Transferred Assets or the
Transferred Subsidiary. After the Closing Date, each Party shall cooperate
fully with the other Party in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with
Tax Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns and payments in respect thereof
that may materially adversely affect the other Party.

  

  

Section 6.7 Termination of Tax Allocation Agreements.Any Tax allocation or
sharing agreement or similar arrangement, whether or not written, that may
have been entered into by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and the Transferred Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall be settled and/or
terminated as to the Transferred Subsidiary as of the day prior to the Closing
Date, and no payments which are owed by or to the Transferred Subsidiary
pursuant thereto shall be made thereafter. After the Closing Date, neither the
Transferred Subsidiary, on the one hand, nor Seller and its Subsidiaries
(excluding the Transferred Subsidiary), on the other hand, shall have any
further rights or liabilities thereunder with respect to the other party or
parties.

  

  

Section 6.8 No Tax Elections.Purchaser shall not make, and agrees to prevent
the Transferred Subsidiary from making, any election pursuant to Section
338(g) of the Code or any similar provision of non-U.S. Law with respect to
the Transferred Subsidiary without the written consent of Seller.

  

  

Section 6.9 Purchase Price Adjustment.The Parties agree that any indemnity
payment made under this Agreement and any payment made under Section 2.6 or
Section 2.7 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless
otherwise required by Law.

Article VII

  

EMPLOYMENT MATTERS

  

  

Section 7.1 Employment Obligations.

  

  

(a) Employment Terms.

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

Where and to the extent that the transfer of the Business will constitute the
transfer of an undertaking or business for the purposes of the Acquired Rights
or the Employees are employees of the Transferred Subsidiary, and in either
case the employment of the Employees will automatically transfer to Purchaser
or one of its Affiliates, the employment of such Employees shall not be
terminated upon the Closing and the rights, powers, duties, liabilities and
obligations of any Seller Party to or in respect of such employees in respect
of any contract of employment with such employees in force immediately before
the Closing shall be transferred to Purchaser and/or one of its Affiliates in
accordance with the Acquired Rights or local employment or other Laws
(including, if applicable, in accordance with the requirements of any
applicable works council or other employee body agreement).

   
---|--- 
 

  

    

(ii)

  |  

To the extent that Acquired Rights or the local employment or other Laws do
not provide for the automatic transfer of employees upon the transfer of a
business or part of a business as a going concern (or in any jurisdiction
where the Acquired Rights or local employment or other Laws do provide for the
automatic transfer of employees upon the transfer of a business or part of a
business as a going concern but for any reason any Employee does not transfer
automatically by operation of law or upon the transfer of the Transferred
Subsidiary), Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, within
a reasonable number of Business Days determined by the Parties in good faith
prior to the Closing Date (or within the period of time required by local
Law), offer employment in writing to each Employee, and Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall allow each such Employee no less than five (5) Business Days
(or the period of time required by local Law) to consider such offer and shall
notify Seller promptly (and in any event prior to Closing) whether each such
offer has been accepted, rejected, remains outstanding or has not yet been
issued because local Law requires otherwise. Each offer of employment made by
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates pursuant to this Section 7.1(a)(ii) shall
(1) be contingent on the Closing, (2) be contingent on such Employee entering
into restrictive covenants comparable to those restrictive covenants that are
in force immediately before the Closing between such Employee and any Seller
Party, (3) be made in a manner consistent with applicable Law and provide for
employment commencing on the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the Deferred
Employee Transfer Date), or, if such Employee is an STD Employee, on the later
of the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the Deferred Employee Transfer Date)
and the date that such Employee returns to active service in accordance with
the terms of such Employee's leave unless otherwise required by applicable Law
(such Closing Date, Deferred Employee Transfer Date or, with respect to an STD
Employee, date of return to active service or other date required by
applicable Law, the "Effective Hire Date") and (4) provide for employment on
the Minimum Terms and Conditions of Employment commencing on the Effective
Hire Date; provided, that this Section 7.1(a)(ii)(4) shall not apply to the
Selected Employees; and provided, further, that Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall have no obligation to offer employment to or hire any such STD Employee
who does not return to active service prior to the six (6) month anniversary
of the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the Deferred Employee Transfer Date)
unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Seller shall retain all
Liabilities related to any STD Employees unless and until such STD Employee
commences employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, at which time
such STD Employee shall be treated as a Transferred Employee.

   
---|--- 
 

  

    

(iii)

  |  

Purchaser and Seller shall each provide the other Party with information
reasonably requested to verify that offers of employment are in compliance
with Section 7.1(a)(ii) (to the extent that Purchaser is required to make
offers of employment under Section 7.1(a)(ii)). As often as the Parties deem
necessary in good faith, but in no case later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller, in consultation with, and subject to final
approval by, Purchaser, will update Sections 1.1(t)(i) and 1.1(t)(ii) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule to reflect changes prior to the Closing Date on
account of (i) new hires to fill the open positions set forth in Section
5.7(xiv) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (ii) attrition among the
Employees, (iii) minor changes intended to correct good faith errors or
omissions by Seller in determining which employees are Employees and (iv) any
other change as mutually agreed on in good faith by Seller and Purchaser. Five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide to the
Purchaser (x) a final version of Sections 1.1(t)(i) and 1.1(t)(ii) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule setting forth all of the Employees and (y) a list
of any Employee who is an STD Employee. For the avoidance of doubt, any action
or obligation to be taken by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection
with the Closing shall be with respect to the Employees set forth in the final
versions of Sections 1.1(t)(i) and 1.1(t)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule provided pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence; provided,
however, that where applicable local Laws preclude Purchaser from satisfying
its obligations under Section 7.1 upon Closing, Purchaser shall be entitled to
satisfy its obligations by such later date as required by applicable local
Laws.

   
---|--- 
 

  

    

(iv)

  |  

As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no case later
than thirty (30) Business Days before the Closing Date, Seller shall provide,
or cause to be provided, to Purchaser (i) any information, on an
individualized basis for each Employee (if, in the reasonable good faith
judgment of Purchaser, individualized information is required to satisfy
Purchaser's obligations under this Section 7.1), on the terms and conditions
of employment that is necessary for Purchaser to determine the Minimum Terms
and Conditions of Employment of the Transferred Employees and (ii) a list of
each Employee who participates in a Transferred Employee Plan, including
identification of such Transferred Employee Plan. As often as the Parties deem
necessary in good faith, but in no case later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller, in consultation with Purchaser, will
provide updated information described in this Section 7.1(a)(iv). Five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide to the Purchaser
a final version of the information described in this Section 7.1(a)(iv)
concerning all Employees on the final versions of Sections 1.1(t)(i) and
1.1(t)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

(v)

  |  

Except as may be required by applicable Law or this Article VII, as of the
Effective Hire Date and through the 12 month period following the Effective
Hire Date (such period, the "Continuation Period"), the employment of
Transferred Employees (other than the Selected Employees) shall be on the
Minimum Terms and Conditions of Employment; provided, however, that Purchaser
may in its sole discretion decide to provide certain Employees with more
favorable terms and conditions of employment than the Minimum Terms and
Conditions of Employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any
Employee who transfers in accordance with the Acquired Rights, Purchaser shall
maintain the terms and conditions of employment, compensation and benefits and
working conditions in accordance with the Acquired Rights to the extent
required by Law.

   
---|--- 
 

  

    

(vi)

  |  

The Parties agree to the rights and obligations set forth on Section
7.1(a)(vi) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule with respect to the Selected
Employees.

   
---|--- 
 

  

    

(vii)

  |  

Effective at Closing (or, if applicable, the Deferred Employee Transfer Date),
the Seller Parties shall waive all applicable non-competes and non-solicits as
to Purchaser concerning the Transferred Employees.

   
---|--- 
 

  

    

(viii)

  |  

Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, pay the Selected
Compensation Payments to each eligible Transferred Employee who, immediately
prior to the Closing Date, participated in and qualified for such Selected
Compensation Payments under the Seller Employee Plans listed on Section 1.1(k)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Such payment shall be made in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the applicable Seller Employee Plan listed on
Section 1.1(k) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Seller shall provide
Purchaser with true and correct copies of each Seller Employee Plan listed on
Section 1.1(k) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule prior to the Closing Date.

(b) Employee Benefits.

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

After the date of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate
promptly and in good faith in preparing the transition of the Transferred
Employees as applicable from coverage under Seller Employee Plans to coverage
under the Purchaser Employee Plans effective as of the Transferred Employee's
Effective Hire Date. Except as required by applicable Law and as otherwise
provided in this Article VII or in Section 5.12(a), as of the applicable
Effective Hire Date, the Transferred Employees shall cease to accrue further
benefits under the Seller Employee Plans (other than the Seller Employee Plans
maintained by the Transferred Subsidiary) and shall commence participation in
the Purchaser Employee Plans, subject to the terms and conditions of such
Purchaser Employee Plans.

   
---|--- 
 

  

    

(ii)

  |  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser or one
of its Affiliates shall, during the Continuation Period, maintain for the
benefit of each Transferred Employee a severance or termination arrangement no
less favorable than the severance or termination arrangement provided
immediately prior to the applicable Effective Hire Date to such Transferred
Employee by the Seller Party that previously employed such Transferred
Employee.

   
---|--- 
 

  

    

(iii)

  |  

Seller shall remain liable and retain responsibility for, and continue to pay
in accordance with the terms of the applicable plans, all medical, life
insurance and other welfare plan expenses and benefits for each Transferred
Employee with respect to claims incurred by such Transferred Employee (or his
or her covered dependents) on or prior to the applicable Effective Hire Date,
and shall remain liable for workers compensation claims (including medical,
disability, permanency and expense claims) incurred by any Transferred
Employee prior to the Effective Hire Date. Purchaser shall be liable and
responsible for all expenses and benefits with respect to medical, life
insurance and other welfare plan claims incurred by each Transferred Employee
(or his or her covered dependents) on or after the applicable Effective Hire
Date. For purposes of this Section 7.1(b)(iii), a claim is deemed incurred: in
the case of medical or dental benefits, when the services that are the subject
of the claim are performed; in the case of life insurance, when the death
occurs; in the case of accidental death and dismemberment or workers
compensation claims, when the event giving rise to the claim occurs; and in
the case of a claim that results in a hospital admission, on the date of
admission.

   
---|--- 
 

  

    

(iv)

  |  

Each Transferred Employee (and their eligible dependents, as applicable) shall
be eligible, effective as of the relevant Effective Hire Date and during the
Continuation Period, to participate in and accrue benefits under the Purchaser
Employee Plans on terms and conditions determined by Purchaser in accordance
with the Minimum Terms and Conditions of Employment (unless otherwise required
by applicable Law), as applicable. With respect to any Purchaser Employee Plan
that is a "welfare benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA
or would be considered a "welfare benefit plan" if it were subject to ERISA,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, (A) waive, to the extent
waived under the comparable Seller Employee Plan, any eligibility periods,
waiting periods, actively at work requirements and evidence of insurability or
pre-existing condition limitations with respect to participation and coverage
requirements and (B) make commercially reasonable efforts to cause such plans
to honor any deductibles, co-payments, co-insurance or out-of-pocket expenses
paid or incurred by any Transferred Employee (and his or her covered
dependents) under comparable Seller Employee Plans during the portion of the
applicable Purchaser Employee Plan year in which the applicable Effective Hire
Date occurs.

   
---|--- 
 

  

    

(v)

  |  

The Transferred Employees shall be given credit for all service with any of
the Seller Parties (and their respective predecessors), to the same extent as
such service was credited for such purposes by any Seller Party, under each
Purchaser Employee Plan in which such Transferred Employees are eligible to
participate, effective as of the applicable Effective Hire Date for all
purposes, including (A) eligibility to participate, eligibility for early
retirement, vesting and benefit accrual (including, but not limited to, long
service leave accruals in Australia, vacation and severance benefits);
provided, that such service credit shall not be given (1) for purposes of
benefit accrual under any Purchaser Employee Plan, other than a Transferred
Employee Plan, that is a defined benefit pension plan, except as otherwise
required by Law, or (2) to the extent that such service credit would result in
a duplication of benefits, and (B) to the extent applicable to any non-U.S.
Transferred Employees, seniority. For purposes of this paragraph a "pension
plan" means only a retirement or termination plan that meets the definition of
a "defined benefit pension plan" within the meaning of FAS87.

In the event that accrued and unused vacation days are not required by
applicable Law to be paid out upon termination by the Seller Parties,
Purchaser shall assume, honor and be responsible for any Liabilities in
respect of all unused vacation days that are due and owing to the Transferred
Employees (including, for the avoidance of doubt, both annual eligibility and
carryover vacation days) as of their applicable Effective Hire Date, and
Purchaser shall permit, or cause its relevant Affiliate to permit, the
Transferred Employees to use such vacation days during the year in which the
Closing occurs in accordance with Seller vacation policies in effect as of the
Closing Date. During the year following the year in which the Closing occurs,
each Transferred Employee (save where the Acquired Rights or other applicable
Law provide otherwise) will be entitled to vacation under Purchaser's vacation
policies on terms determined by Purchaser in accordance with the Minimum Terms
and Conditions of Employment (unless otherwise required by applicable Law), as
applicable; provided that, each Transferred Employee will be permitted to
carryover from the year in which the Closing occurs into the year immediately
following the year in which the Closing occurs (or, at Purchaser's election,
be paid out by Purchaser for) such number of unused vacation days that the
Transferred Employee would have been permitted to carryover under Seller's
vacation policy applicable to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to
the Closing.

(vii)

  |  

Seller shall be solely responsible for providing or discharging any and all
notifications, benefits and liabilities to the Transferred Employees and any
governmental authorities that are required by the WARN Act with respect to
relocations, plant closings or terminations of employment, if applicable, that
occur on or prior to the Closing (including all technical terminations of the
Transferred Employees resulting from the Closing as may be required under
applicable Law) and with respect to any Employee who does not become a
Transferred Employee regardless of the date of such termination, provided that
Purchaser has satisfied its obligations as set out in this Article VII, and
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for any and all such matters that occur
after the Closing. For purposes of this Section 7.1(b)(vii), a mass layoff
shall be deemed to occur after the Closing if the mass layoff would not have
occurred but for Purchaser's failure to offer to employ the Transferred
Employees in accordance with the terms of this Article VII; provided, that
Seller has timely provided Purchaser with all information necessary for
Purchaser to satisfy its obligations under this Article VII. The Parties shall
cooperate in preparing and distributing any notices that Purchaser may desire
to provide prior to the Closing in connection with actions by Purchaser after
the Closing that would result in a notice requirement under the WARN Act.

   
---|--- 
 

  

    

(viii)

  |  

Purchaser shall be solely responsible for satisfying the continuation coverage
requirements of COBRA, Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA and the regulations thereunder (and any liability arising
from the actions or inactions of Purchaser or its Affiliates with respect to
such coverage) for all Transferred Employees who are "MandA qualified
beneficiaries", as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9, after the Closing Date. Seller shall be solely responsible for
providing all Employees (and their dependents) with any notices required by
COBRA with respect to any qualifying events that occur on or prior to the
Closing Date and retain all obligations with respect to the continuation
coverage requirements of COBRA, Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and the regulations thereunder for all
Employees who do not become Transferred Employees; provided that the
Transferred Subsidiary and Purchaser shall be liable for all obligations under
COBRA in respect of current and former employees of the Transferred Subsidiary
whether arising before, on or after the Closing Date under any Seller Employee
Plans maintained by the Transferred Subsidiary.

(ix)

  |  

Neither Section 7.1(a) nor this Section 7.1(b) restricts the right of
Purchaser to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee after the
Closing or, except as expressly provided in Section 7.1(a) or this Section
7.1(b) or as required by applicable Law, to modify the terms and conditions of
employment applicable to any Transferred Employee after the Closing; provided
that, to the extent that Seller has timely provided Purchaser with all
information reasonably necessary for Purchaser to satisfy its obligations
under this Article VII, Purchaser shall be solely responsible for, and shall
indemnify and hold Seller harmless from all Liabilities related to, any such
termination or modification after the Closing (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any change in the terms or conditions of employment of an Employee who
will transfer in accordance with the Acquired Rights). In addition, nothing
contained in this Agreement, express or implied, shall (i) be construed to
establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
or (ii) give any Third Party any right to enforce the provisions of this
Article VII.

(c) Defined Contribution Pension Plans.

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

Effective as of the Closing Date, or as promptly thereafter as may be
administratively practicable, Purchaser shall cause a Purchaser Employee Plan
that is intended to be a U.S. tax-qualified defined contribution pension plan
(the "Purchaser U.S. Pension Replacement Plan") to accept the enrollment of
the Transferred Employees who participated in any of Seller's U.S. tax-
qualified defined contribution or defined benefit pension plans immediately
prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall take all reasonable steps necessary
to permit each Transferred Employee, if any, who shall receive an eligible
rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from any
of Seller's U.S. tax-qualified defined contribution or defined benefit pension
plans to rollover such eligible rollover distribution, including any
associated loan of cash as part of any lump sum distribution to the extent
permitted by the applicable Seller plan and applicable Law, into an account
under a Purchaser U.S. Pension Replacement Plan as of the Closing Date (or, if
applicable, the Deferred Employee Transfer Date), or as promptly thereafter as
may be administratively practicable.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

Effective as of the Closing Date, or as promptly thereafter as may be
administratively practicable, and except to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law, Purchaser shall cause Purchaser Employee Plans that are
"defined contribution pension plans" within the meaning of FAS87 to accept the
enrollment of any non-U.S. Transferred Employees who participated in any of
Seller's defined benefit pension plans in the jurisdictions with no
Transferred Employee Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date. In addition,
Purchaser shall take all steps that are commercially reasonable to cause one
or more analogous Purchaser Employee Plans to accept the enrollment of any
non-U.S. Transferred Employees who participated in any Seller Employee Plan
that is a "defined contribution pension plan" within the meaning of FAS87
immediately prior to the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the Deferred
Employee Transfer Date) effective as of the Closing Date, or as promptly
thereafter as may be administratively practicable, and, except where the
assets in respect of a non-U.S. Transferred Employee in such "defined
contribution pension plan" could be less than the Liabilities in respect of
such non-U.S. Transferred Employee, or to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law, Seller shall cause to be transferred from each such plan the
Liabilities and, as applicable, the assets for the account balances of those
non-U.S. Transferred Employees as promptly after the Closing Date as may be
administratively practicable.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(d) Defined Benefit Pension Plans.

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

Purchaser shall assume and be responsible in respect of each Transferred
Employee who participated in a plan that is a "defined benefit pension plan"
within the meaning of FAS87 as listed on Section 7.1(d)(i) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule for the Liabilities in relation to that plan (each such
plan, a "Transferred Employee Plan" and each such Transferred Employee, a
"Pension Plan Employee") on the Closing Date. Seller shall retain and be
responsible for the Liabilities in respect of each Transferred Employee under
every other plan that is a "defined benefit pension plan" within the meaning
of FAS87 and is not listed on Section 7.1(d)(i) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

To the extent provided in Section 7.1(d)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, Seller shall effect a transfer of assets from the Transferred
Employee Plans in respect of the Liability for each Pension Plan Employee in
such amounts as shall be reasonably determined by Seller's actuary and in
accordance with Section 7.1(d)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (or such
greater amounts as may be required by applicable Law) (the "Transfer Amount"),
and Purchaser shall cause a Purchaser Employee Plan to accept such assets.
Seller shall select the kind of assets to be transferred if there are
alternate forms of assets that may be transferred under local Law or existing
Contract, provided that such form is reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and
permitted under the Contract or rules governing the relevant Purchaser
Employee Plan. For purposes of this Section 7.1(d)(ii), the amount to be
transferred shall be adjusted to take into account benefit payments made from
the Transferred Employee Plans to the applicable Pension Plan Employees after
the Closing Date but prior to the date of transfer by Seller or its Affiliates
("Interim Pension Payments"). The Interim Pension Payments shall be reasonably
determined by the applicable plan's administrator in accordance with actuarial
advice and administrative practice. Any transfer of assets pursuant to this
Section 7.1(d)(ii) shall be effected as soon as practicable after the Closing,
but in any event within one (1) year after the Closing Date or, if later, the
earliest date that is administratively practicable as reasonably determined by
Seller; provided, however, that in no event shall such transfer take place
until the receipt of any approval required by any Government Entity.

Section 7.2 Assumed Employee Liabilities.

  

  

(a) Except as required by applicable Law, Seller Parties shall remain
responsible for paying, and shall indemnify Purchaser against, any Liabilities
concerning the Employees (including Transferred Employees) and former
Employees arising out of any act or omission of any Seller Party occurring
prior to and through the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the Deferred
Employee Transfer Date). In addition, for those Employees employed in Germany,
Brazil, Canada, Korea, Sweden, Austria, and Venezuela, except as required by
applicable Law, the Seller Parties shall remain responsible for paying, and
shall indemnify Purchaser against, any Liabilities concerning any Employee (A)
who refuses or objects to transfer to Purchaser in a jurisdiction where local
Laws provide the Employee with the right to refuse or object to transfer to
Purchaser or (B) who rejects an offer of employment with Purchaser (so long as
the offer of employment by Purchaser complies with the requirements of Section
7.1(a)(ii)). Purchaser shall assume and be responsible for any Liabilities
first arising out of or related to (I) any Transferred Employee's post-Closing
employment or termination of employment with Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates after his or her Effective Hire Date (including any claim for
severance, any statutory, contractual or common law termination pay, pay in
lieu of notice of termination and any other compensation or benefits to which
the applicable Transferred Employee may be entitled upon a termination of
employment under any Law, plan, policy, practice or agreement in effect at the
time of such termination of employment); (II) Purchaser's or any of its
Affiliates' failure to provide any required notice of continued employment or
to offer employment, as applicable, to any Employee pursuant to Section
7.1(a)(i) or (ii) (including where the process by which an offer is made is
not consistent with the requirements of applicable Law); (III) any claim for
termination of employment (including any claim or Liability for severance, any
statutory, contractual or common law termination pay, pay in lieu of notice of
termination and any other compensation or benefits to which the applicable
Employee may be entitled upon a termination of employment under any plan,
policy, practice or agreement) of any Employee (other than a Selected
Employee) who is not offered employment on the Minimum Terms and Conditions of
Employment by Purchaser and/or one of its Affiliates pursuant to Section
7.1(a)(ii); (IV) violation by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of any Law or
agreement, including any employee contracts, with respect to any Transferred
Employee; (V) any Purchaser Employee Plan or Transferred Employee Plan,
whether such Liabilities arise prior to, on or after the Closing; and (VI)
failure to assume any employment contracts with Employees who will transfer in
accordance with the Acquired Rights; provided, that Seller shall assume and be
responsible for any such claims and Liabilities discussed in this Section
7.2(a) if Seller has failed to timely provide Purchaser with all information
reasonably necessary for Purchaser to satisfy its obligations under this
Article VII.

  

  

(b) Except as otherwise set forth in this Article VII, Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and any of its Affiliates from and
against, and promptly pay Seller for, any Liabilities imposed on Seller or any
of its Affiliates resulting from the violation of the Acquired Rights or other
local Laws by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, but not limited to, any
failure to provide Seller and any of its Affiliates with any proposed measures
in relation to the treatment of Employees who will transfer in accordance with
the Acquired Rights), and Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Purchaser and any of its Affiliates from and against, and promptly pay
Purchaser for, any Liabilities imposed on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
resulting from the violation of the Acquired Rights or other local Laws by
Seller or its Affiliates. To the extent, due to the Acquired Rights or other
applicable local Laws or otherwise, Seller or any of its Affiliates incurs any
Liabilities sustained or incurred by the affected Person that would otherwise
be assumed by Purchaser under Section 7.2(a), Purchaser shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller or such Affiliate, as applicable, from and
against, and promptly pay Seller for, such Liability.

  

  

(c) If any Person other than a Transferred Employee claims that as a result of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement his contract of employment has
transferred to Purchaser pursuant to the Acquired Rights or otherwise, the
following process shall be followed:

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing within seven (7) days of becoming
aware of such claim ("Notification");

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

Purchaser may, at its option, within seven (7) days of "Notification" accept
such Person's claim and continue to employ them on terms similar to those
which would have applied had such Person transferred as a Transferred
Employee;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

within 21 days of Notification, provided Purchaser has not already confirmed
that it is prepared to accept such Person's claim, Seller may make, or may
procure a Third Party to make, an offer of employment to such Person (in which
case, Purchaser agrees at Seller\'s request to release such Person immediately
from its employment); and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iv)

  |  

if no such offer is made, or is made and not accepted, Seller agrees to
indemnify Purchaser against any Liabilities arising from the dismissal of such
Person (including the cost of providing salary and contractual benefits up to
and including the date of such dismissal) provided any dismissal takes effect
within 42 days of Notification (or, if applicable, within the period of time
required by local Law) and on the minimum notice which can lawfully be given.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(d) In the event that Purchaser's offer of employment to, or employment during
the Continuation Period of, a Transferred Employee in accordance with the
Minimum Terms and Conditions of Employment triggers any right to severance,
any statutory, contractual or common law termination pay, pay in lieu of
notice of termination or any other compensation or benefits to which a
Transferred Employee may be entitled upon a termination of employment under
any Law, plan, policy practice or agreement that covers such Transferred
Employee (collectively, "Severance Payments") that is payable by Seller or any
of its Affiliates, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller and its
Affiliates harmless from any such Liability that arises in connection with
such right; provided, that Purchaser shall have no such obligation to
indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from any such Liability
if Seller has failed to timely provide Purchaser with all information
reasonably necessary for Purchaser to satisfy its obligations under this
Article VII, and likewise, that Purchaser shall have no such obligation to
indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from any such Liability
if Seller has failed to timely provide Purchaser with all information
necessary for Purchaser to comply with local Laws setting forth information,
notice or consultation requirements with trade unions, works' councils,
employees and/or employee representative bodies in connection with the
Transactions as required by applicable local Law. To the extent that Purchaser
does have an obligation to indemnify Seller, Seller shall provide Purchaser
with a written notice not less than thirty (30) Business Days prior to the
date of payment (the "Severance Payment Date") of any Severance Payments
payable to the Transferred Employees, setting forth its good faith estimate of
the aggregate Severance Payments to be paid to the applicable Transferred
Employees as of the date of such notice (the "Estimated Severance Payment
Amount"). Purchaser shall deliver to Seller, not less than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Severance Payment Date, an amount in cash equal to the
Estimated Severance Payment Amount. Within ten (10) Business Days after the
Severance Payment Date, Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, in good
faith and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the "Severance Payment Statement")
setting forth and calculating in reasonable detail the aggregate Severance
Payments actually paid by Seller or any of its Affiliates (the "Actual
Severance Payment Amount") on the Severance Payment Date to the applicable
Transferred Employees as of the relevant date (accompanied by reasonable
support therefor). If: (a) the Actual Severance Payment Amount is greater than
the Estimated Severance Payment Amount, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller an
amount equal to such excess; (b) the Estimated Severance Payment Amount is
greater than the Actual Severance Payment Amount, then Seller shall pay to
Purchaser an amount equal to such excess; or (c) the Estimated Severance
Payment Amount is equal to the Actual Severance Payment Amount, then no
payment will be made by either Seller or Purchaser. Any such payment made
pursuant to this Section 7.2(d) shall be paid promptly (and in any event
within 15 Business Days) after the delivery by Seller to Purchaser of the
Severance Payment Statement, in cash in U.S. dollars, by wire transfer of
immediately available federal funds to such bank account as shall be
designated in writing by the recipient of such funds.

Section 7.3 Other Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Seller and Purchaser agree to cooperate to coordinate all employee-related
Tax withholdings and reporting for the year in which the Closing occurs.

  

  

(b) After the date of this Agreement, upon reasonable advance written notice,
Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and assist Purchaser and its
Affiliates in its communications with the Employees; provided that such
cooperation shall be conducted at Purchaser's expense and in such manner as
not to interfere with the normal operations of Sellers and its Affiliates. If
requested, Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with the Seller Parties in
respect of the development and distribution of any announcement and
communication to the employees of the Seller Parties, including Employees,
with respect to this Agreement or any of the Transactions; provided that such
cooperation shall be conducted at the Seller Parties' expense.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Closing (or, if applicable, the Deferred Employee Transfer
Date), (i) Seller and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to comply with any Law or other legal requirement (whether statutory or
pursuant to any written agreement with, or the constitution of, any works
council or other employee body), to consult with any Employees, a relevant
trade union, a relevant works council or any other employee representatives in
relation to the Transactions, including the obligation to inform and consult
with the Employees and their representatives pursuant to the Acquired Rights,
(ii) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide Seller with such information as Seller may reasonably request as is
necessary to effectuate clause (i), and (iii) the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all relevant information and
consultation with representatives of Employees who will transfer in accordance
with the Acquired Rights takes place in good time.

  

  

(d) Prior to the Closing (or, if applicable, the Deferred Employee Transfer
Date), Purchaser undertakes to keep the Employee Information in confidence
including the following actions:

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

Purchaser shall restrict the disclosure of the Employee Information only to
such of its respective employees, agents and advisors as is necessary for the
purposes of complying with its obligations pursuant to this Agreement (and/or
implementing the Transactions);

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

the Employee Information shall not be used except for the purposes of
complying with the obligations of Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement (and/or
implementing the Transactions) and shall be returned to Seller or destroyed,
at Seller's election, if this Agreement is terminated; and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such
additional obligations with respect to the confidential treatment of Employee
Information as may be reasonably required in any particular jurisdiction to
comply with any applicable data privacy Laws.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(e) Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with each other to provide
for an orderly transition of the Transferred Employees from Seller and the
Other Sellers to Purchaser and to minimize the disruption to the respective
businesses of the Parties resulting from the Transactions.

  

  

(f) To the extent required by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Seller
or Purchaser in order to give effect to the intentions of this Article VII,
Seller and Purchaser (or their respective Affiliates, as applicable), will
enter into mutually acceptable tripartite, employer substitution or similar
agreements to provide for the transfer of Employees to Purchaser and/or one of
its Affiliates.

  

  

(g) During the Non-Solicitation Period, without Seller's advance written
consent or as expressly permitted by this Agreement or as otherwise required
by applicable Law, Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates
to, either directly or indirectly, either individually or acting in concert
with another Person or Persons, solicit for employment or any similar
arrangement, or hire, or assist any other Person in hiring, or otherwise use
or solicit the services of (i) any of the employees of Seller or any of its
Affiliates, or (ii) any former employees of Seller or any of its Affiliates
until such time as the individual has not been employed by or provided
services to, as applicable, Seller or any of its Affiliates for a continuous
six (6) month period; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7.3(g)
shall prevent Purchaser from (x) conducting generalized employment searches,
including placing bona fide public advertisements, that are not specifically
targeted at such employees or former employees of Seller or any of its
Affiliates or (y) hiring such employees or former employees of Seller or any
of its Affiliates identified through such employment searches.

  

  

(h) During the Non-Solicitation Period, without Purchaser's advance written
consent, Seller shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, either
directly or indirectly, either individually or acting in concert with another
Person or Persons, solicit for employment or any similar arrangement, or hire,
or assist any other Person in hiring, or otherwise use or solicit the services
of (i) any of the employees of the Business, or (ii) any former employee of
the Business until such time as the individual has not been employed by or
provided services to the Business for a continuous six (6) month period;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7.3(h) shall prevent Seller
from (x) conducting generalized employment searches, including placing bona
fide public advertisements, that are not specifically targeted at such
employees or former employees of the Business, (y) hiring such employees or
former employees of the Business identified through such employment searches,
except that under no circumstances shall Seller hire any Selected Employee who
becomes employed by Purchaser prior to the 12 month anniversary of the Closing
without Purchaser's prior written consent unless such Person has been
terminated by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser without cause, as
determined by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser or (z) hiring or
continuing to employ individuals who are employees of the Business as of the
Closing Date but who do not become Transferred Employees.

  

  

(i) Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this Article VII with respect to Transferred Employees are included for the
sole benefit of Purchaser and Seller. Nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall (i) create any third party beneficiary or other
rights in any other Person, including any current or former employees of
Purchaser, Seller or their respective Affiliates, any participant in any
Purchaser Employee Plan or the Seller Employee Plan, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof or (ii) require Purchaser, Seller or any respective
Affiliate to continue any Purchaser Employee Plan or the Seller Employee Plan
or prevent or require or constitute or be construed as the amendment,
modification or termination thereof, except as specifically set forth herein.

Article X

 

  

  

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

Section 10.1 Survival.No representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement
(other than the Ancillary Agreements) shall survive beyond the Closing Date,
except for covenants and agreements that by their terms are to be satisfied
after the Closing Date, which covenants and agreements shall survive until
satisfied in accordance with their terms. No claim for indemnification may be
asserted against any Party for breach of any covenant or agreement contained
herein unless written notice of such claim is received by such Party
describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to
the subject matter of such claim on or prior to the date on which the covenant
or agreement on which such claim is based ceases to survive as set forth in
this Section 10.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim for
indemnification for which notice has been given prior to the date on which the
covenant or agreement on which such claim is based ceases to survive as set
forth in this Section 10.1 may be prosecuted to conclusion (and such Party
seeking indemnification shall be entitled to be indemnified for all Losses
related thereto, subject to the other limitations contained in this Article X)
notwithstanding the subsequent expiration of such period.

  

  

Section 10.2 Indemnification by Purchaser.From and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Seller Party, its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiary), and its directors,
officers, shareholders, partners, members, agents, representatives and
employees and their heirs, successors and permitted assigns, each in their
capacity as such (the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from, against and in
respect of any Losses, whether in respect of Third Party Claims, claims
between the parties hereto, or otherwise but excluding Indirect Losses
(subject to the limitations set forth herein, "Indemnified Losses"), arising
out of or related to (a) the breach of or default in the performance by
Purchaser of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement after Closing or (b) the Assumed
Liabilities.

  

  

Section 10.3 Indemnification by Seller.From and after the Closing, Seller
shall, jointly and severally, and each of the Other Sellers, severally and
solely with respect to its own actions, circumstances and breaches (and solely
to the extent such action, circumstance or breach is the cause of such
Indemnified Loss), shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser and
each of its Affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members,
agents, representatives and employees and their heirs, successors and
permitted assigns (the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties" and, together with the
Seller Indemnified Parties, the "Indemnified Parties") from, against and in
respect of any Indemnified Losses arising out of or related to (a) the breach
of or default in the performance by Seller of any covenant, agreement or
obligation to be performed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement after Closing
or (b) the Excluded Liabilities; provided, however, that from and after the
execution and delivery of any BFN Local Transfer Agreement following the
acceptance of the relevant BFN Irrevocable Offer, any Liabilities assumed by
Purchaser or its designated Foreign Acquisition Entity pursuant to such BFN
Local Transfer Agreement shall not be Excluded Liabilities for the purpose of
this Section 10.3.

  

  

Section 10.4 Indemnification Procedures.

  

  

(a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an indemnifying
party (an "Indemnifying Party") may have liability to any Indemnified Party
hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified
Party by a Third Party (a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall
promptly, but in no event more than 30 days following such Indemnified Party's
receipt of a Third Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of
such Third Party Claim (a "Claim Notice"); provided, however, that the failure
to give a Claim Notice within 30 days shall affect the rights of an
Indemnified Party hereunder only to the extent that such failure has a
prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall have 30 days (or such lesser number of days set forth in the Claim
Notice as may be required by court proceeding in the event of a litigated
matter) after receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the
Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such
Third Party Claim.

  

  

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the
sole power to direct and control such defense at its expense. Once the
Indemnifying Party has duly assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate
in any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing. The
Indemnified Party shall participate in any such defense at its expense unless
(i) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that representation
of the Indemnified Party's interests by the Indemnifying Party's counsel would
be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them
or (ii) the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim after
the Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently pursue a Third Party Claim it
has assumed, as provided in the first sentence of Section 10.4(c), in which
case the Indemnifying Party shall pay the expenses of the Indemnified Party's
counsel. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise
any Third Party Claim on a basis that would result in (i) the imposition of a
consent order, injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or
conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (ii) a finding or
admission of a violation of Law (except Tax Law) or violation of the rights of
any Person by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (iii) any
monetary liability of the Indemnified Party that will not be promptly paid or
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise, (ii) the Third Party
Claim seeks injunctive relief that would restrict the future activity or
conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (iii) after
assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps
necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within ten (10) days
after receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that
the Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right but not the obligation to assume its own defense; it being understood
that the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification for a Third Party Claim
shall not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third Party
Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third Party Claim without the
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Party controlling the defense of any
Third Party Claim shall, at the reasonable request of the non-controlling
party, inform the non-controlling party of the status of such Third Party
Claim.

  

  

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third Party Claim, including by
providing access to each other's relevant business records and other
documents, and employees; it being understood that the costs and expenses of
the Indemnified Party relating thereto shall be Losses.

  

  

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

Section 10.5 Adjustments to Losses.

  

  

(a) Insurance. In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any insurance
policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against
any other Person in each case relating to the Third Party Claim or the Direct
Claim, net of any actual costs, expenses or premiums incurred in connection
with securing or obtaining such proceeds, shall be deducted, except to the
extent that the adjustment itself would excuse, exclude or limit the coverage
of all or part of such Loss. In the event that an Indemnified Party has any
rights against a Third Party with respect to any occurrence, claim or loss
that results in a payment by an Indemnifying Party under this Article X, such
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to such rights to the extent of such
payment; provided that until the Indemnified Party recovers full payment of
the Loss related to any such Direct Claim, any and all claims of the
Indemnifying Party against any such Third Party on account of said indemnity
payment is hereby expressly made subordinate and subject in right of payment
to the Indemnified Party's rights against such Third Party. Without limiting
the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, each Indemnified Party
and Indemnifying Party shall duly execute upon request all instruments
reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the subrogation and subordination
rights detailed herein, and otherwise cooperate in the prosecution of such
claims.

  

  

(b) Taxes. Any amount of any Loss for which reimbursement or indemnification
is provided under Article VI (Tax Matters), Article VII (Employment Matters)
or this Article X shall be (i) decreased by any Tax benefit actually realized
as a decrease in Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate
thereof) as a result of the incurrence or payment of any such Loss (including
as a result of the facts, matters, events or circumstances giving rise to such
Losses), and (ii) increased by any Tax cost actually incurred as an increase
in Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof) as a
result of the receipt or accrual of the indemnification payment so that the
amount received by the Indemnified Party (or Affiliate) is the amount which it
would have received had the Tax cost not been incurred. For purposes of this
Section 10.5(b), the Seller Parties and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate
in good faith as to the amounts of any adjustments pursuant to (i) and (ii) of
the preceding sentence.

  

  

(c) Reimbursement. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a Third
Party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder
after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Article X, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the
Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the amount received from the
Third Party in respect thereof, less (ii) the full amount of Loss.

  

  

(d) Mitigation. Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any indemnifiable Loss. In the event an Indemnified Party
fails to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate an indemnifiable
Loss, the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability for any portion of such
Loss that reasonably would have been avoided had the Indemnified Party made
such efforts.

Article XI 
 

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

  

Section 11.1 Remedies.No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement by any Party will
operate as a waiver of such right, remedy, power or privilege, nor will any
single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege under this
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such right, remedy, power
or privilege or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

  

  

Section 11.2 No Third Party Beneficiaries.This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns and nothing herein, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.3 Consent to Amendments; Waivers.No Party shall be deemed to have
waived any provision of this Agreement or any of the other Ancillary
Agreements unless such waiver is in writing, and then such waiver shall be
limited to the circumstances set forth in such written waiver. This Agreement
shall not be amended, altered or qualified except by an instrument in writing
signed by all the parties hereto or thereto, as the case may be.

  

  

Section 11.4 Successors and Assigns.This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No Party may assign any of its rights
or delegate any of its obligations or novate any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior
written consent of the other Party (other than as provided in this Section
11.4). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, prior to Closing and following
written notice to Seller no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
effective date of the assignment and/or novation, Purchaser shall assign
and/or novate all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement,
effective at Closing, to one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries of Purchaser (each such entity, a "Purchaser Required Assign" and
such assignment and/or novation, a "Required Transfer") and shall cause the
Purchaser Required Assign to execute and deliver the Ancillary Agreements at
Closing; provided, that (a) a Required Transfer does not delay or impede the
consummation of the Transactions or impair the rights of any Seller Party
under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements, (b) a Required Transfer does
not result in additional Taxes being imposed on the Seller Parties or being
withheld from the Purchase Price payable hereunder and (c) each Purchaser
Required Assign shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations
under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Following the Required
Transfers, a Purchaser Required Assign shall not assign any of its rights or
delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement or novate any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise,
without the prior written consent of Seller, provided that a Purchaser
Required Assign may, following notice in writing to Seller no later than three
(3) Business Days prior to the effective date of the assignment, delegation or
novation, assign, delegate or novate all or some of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a
Purchaser Required Assign (each such entity a "Purchaser Permitted Assign" and
together with each Purchaser Required Assign, a "Purchaser Assign", and each
such assignment, delegation or novation a "Permitted Transfer"); provided,
further, that (x) all Purchaser Required Assigns remain jointly and severally
liable with such Purchaser Permitted Assignee for all obligations of the
Purchaser Required Assigns under this Agreement, (y) such Permitted Transfer
does not delay or impede the consummation of the Transactions or impair the
rights of any Seller Party under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements
and (z) such Permitted Transfer does not result in additional Taxes being
imposed on the Seller Parties or being withheld from the Purchase Price
payable hereunder. Any attempted or purported assignment in violation of this
Section 11.4 shall be null and void. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Section 11.4 to the contrary, any obligation of any Party to the other
Party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or
fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of such first Party, other than as a
result of a Required Transfer or a Permitted Transfer, shall be deemed to have
been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such Party. The Parties agree that,
notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Section 11.4 or in Section
5.6(a), Purchaser, rather than a Purchaser Assign, on Closing may enter into
the Trademark License Agreements (or thereafter assign, novate or otherwise
transfer the Trademark License Agreements to Purchaser or New Pension Plan or
an Affiliate of New Pension Plan) and satisfy such part of the Purchase Price
as is allocated to the Trademark License Agreements (in each case on its own
behalf) with the consent of Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

Section 11.5 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

.

  

(a) Any questions, claims, disputes, remedies or Actions arising from or
related to this Agreement, and any relief or remedies sought by any Parties,
shall be governed exclusively by the Laws of the State of New York applicable
to contracts made and to be performed in such state and without regard to the
rules of conflict of Laws of any other jurisdiction.

  

  

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Party: (i) agrees
that any claim, action or proceeding by such Party seeking any relief
whatsoever arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the
Transactions shall be brought only in the Bankruptcy Court, if brought prior
to the entry of a final decree closing the Bankruptcy Cases, and in the
Federal Courts in the Southern District of New York and the state courts of
the State of New York, County of New York (collectively, the "New York
Courts"), if brought after entry of a final decree closing the Bankruptcy
Cases, and shall not be brought, in each case, in any other court in the
United States of America; (ii) agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of the
Bankruptcy Court and the New York Courts, as applicable, pursuant to the
preceding clause (a) and this clause (b) for purposes of all legal proceedings
arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions;
(iii) waives and agrees not to assert any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of such Action brought in any such
court or any claim that any such Action brought in such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum; (iv) agrees that the mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such Action or proceeding in the manner provided
in Section 11.6 or any other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid
and sufficient service thereof; and (v) agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law.

  

  

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY (I)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 0.

Section 11.7 Exhibits; Seller Disclosure Schedules.

  

  

(a) The Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Exhibits attached hereto constitute
a part of this Agreement and are incorporated into this Agreement for all
purposes as if fully set forth herein.

  

  

(b) The disclosure of any matter in one section or subsection of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, shall not be deemed to be a disclosure for
any other section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure Schedule unless
either (i) (x) it is readily apparent on the face of such disclosure (and
without reference to the contents of any Contract or document or other
materials referenced in such disclosure) that such matter is pertinent to
another section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and (y) such
disclosure is only with respect to Article III, in which case such disclosure
shall only modify other disclosure with respect to Article III, or (ii) an
express cross-reference to such matter in such section or subsection of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule is contained in such other section or subsection of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule. The mere inclusion of any item in any section
or subsection of the Seller Disclosure Schedule as an exception to any
representation or warranty or otherwise shall not be deemed to constitute an
admission by Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, or to otherwise imply, that
any such item has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect or otherwise represents an exception or material fact, event or
circumstance for the purposes of this Agreement, or that such item meets or
exceeds a monetary or other threshold specified for disclosure in this
Agreement. The sections or subsections of the Seller Disclosure Schedule are
arranged in sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and
subsections of this Agreement. Matters disclosed in any section or subsection
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters that
are required by this Agreement to be disclosed therein. Such additional
matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature or impose any duty or obligation to
disclose any information beyond what is required by this Agreement, and
disclosure of such additional matters shall not affect, directly or
indirectly, the interpretation of this Agreement or the scope of the
disclosure obligations hereunder. The reference to any Contract or other
documents or materials in any section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to include all terms and conditions of, and schedules
and annexes to, such Contract or other document or materials that have been
made available to Seller and its representatives or Purchaser and its
representatives, as applicable. Headings inserted in the sections or
subsections of the Seller Disclosure Schedule are for convenience of reference
only and shall to no extent have the effect of amending or changing the
express terms of the sections or subsections as set forth in this Agreement.

affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may

unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
