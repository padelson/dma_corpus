W I T N E S S E T H :

 

WHEREAS, SpinCo is a wholly owned direct Subsidiary of the Company;

 

WHEREAS, on or prior to the Closing Date, and subject to Section 8.07(f)
below, and to the terms and conditions set forth in the Separation Agreement,
the Company will complete the Internal Reorganization, and following the
Internal Reorganization, the Direct Sale and the SpinCo Transfer and prior to
the Effective Time, and upon the terms and conditions set forth in
the Separation Agreement, the Company will, at its election, either (a)
distribute, without consideration, a number of shares of SpinCos common
stock, par value $0.01 per share ("SpinCo Common Stock"), as determined by
the Company Board but in no event constituting less than the Distribution
Share Minimum or more than the Distribution Share Maximum, to holders of the
Companys common stock, par value $0.06 per share ("Company Common Stock"),
by way of a _pro rata_ dividend (the "One-Step Spin-Off") or (b) consummate
an offer to exchange a number of shares of SpinCo Common Stock as determined
by the Company Board (but no more than the Distribution Share Maximum) for
currently outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock (the "Exchange
Offer") and, in the event that the number of shares of SpinCo Common
Stock for which the Companys stockholders subscribe in the Exchange Offer is
less than the Distribution Share Minimum the Company shall (and in the event
the Companys stockholders subscribe for more than the Distribution Share
Minimum but less than the Distribution Share Maximum, the Company may),
distribute on the Distribution Date immediately following the consummation of
the Exchange Offer, without consideration and _pro rata_ to holders of Company
Common Stock, a number of shares of SpinCo Common Stock as is determined by
the Company so that, following such distribution (and taking into account the
Exchange Offer), a number of shares of SpinCo Common Stock not less than the
Distribution Share Minimum nor more than the Distribution Share Maximum will
have been distributed (the "Clean-Up Spin-Off");

 

WHEREAS, the disposition by the Company of SpinCo Common Stock as set forth
above to the Companys stockholders, whether by way of the One-Step Spin-Off
or the Exchange Offer (followed by any Clean-Up Spin-Off, if necessary),
is referred to as the "Distribution";

WHEREAS, at the Effective Time, the parties hereto will effect the merger of
Merger Sub with and into SpinCo (the "Merger"), with SpinCo continuing as the
surviving corporation, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein; WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes,
the Internal Reorganization, the SpinCo Transfer, the Distribution and the
Merger will be treated as contemplated by the Tax Matters Agreement and,
accordingly, that (a) the SpinCo Transfer and the Distribution, taken
together, will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and that each of the Company and SpinCo will be a
"party to a reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code,
(b) the Distribution, as such, will qualify as (i) a distribution of the
SpinCo Common Stock to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Section 355(a)
of the Code and (ii) a "qualified stock disposition" within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.336-1(b)(6) by reason of the application of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.336-1(b)(5)(ii), such that an election
under Section 336(e) of the Code shall be made with respect to the
Distribution and (c) the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that each of Parent, Merger Sub and
SpinCo will be a "party to a reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(b) of the Code;

WHEREAS, Section 355(e) of the Code is intended to apply to the Distribution
by reason of the "acquisition" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the
Code) of a number of the shares of Parent Common Stock into which the Retained
Shares are converted pursuant to this Agreement as part of a plan (or series
of related transactions) as described in Section 355(e) of the Code that
includes the Distribution (taken together with the Merger);

 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Direct Sale Purchaser intend that, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the Direct Sale will be treated as a taxable
purchase and sale of the Direct Sale Assets;

WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend that the Company shall, in connection with
the Distribution, retain a number of shares of SpinCo Common Stock (the
"Retained Shares") such that the number of shares distributed to the Company
stockholders in the Distribution is not less than the Distribution Share
Minimum or more than the Distribution Share Maximum;

WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend this Agreement to be, and hereby adopt this
Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3;

The Merger

 

Section 2.01. _The Merger_. (a) At the Effective Time, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into SpinCo in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and SpinCo shall be the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Jones Day, 250
Vesey Street, New York, New

 



-17-  York, 10281 as soon as possible, but in any event no later than two Business
Days after the date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those
conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible,
waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or
at such other place or remotely by electronic transmission, at such other time
or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree.

 

(c) At the Closing, SpinCo and Merger Sub shall file a certificate of
merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate
of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such
later time as the parties may agree and as is specified in the certificate of
merger).

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of SpinCo
and Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware Law.

 

(e) At the Closing, each of the Company and Parent shall deliver to the
other a duly executed counterpart to the Shareholders Agreement.

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares_. (a) At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, SpinCo or the holders of SpinCo Common Stock, except as otherwise
provided in Section 2.02(b), each share of SpinCo Common Stock (all shares of
SpinCo Common Stock being collectively, the "Shares") outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive a
number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to the Exchange Ratio (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time,
all such shares of SpinCo Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.03(e), in each
case to be issued or paid, without interest. At the latest practicable time
prior to the Closing so as to allow the parties to calculate the Exchange
Ratio, Parent shall deliver to the Company a certificate, duly executed by an
executive officer of Parent, setting forth the number of Fully Diluted Parent
Shares as of the Closing, together with reasonable supporting documentation.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, SpinCo or the holders of SpinCo Common
Stock, each share of SpinCo Common Stock held by SpinCo as treasury stock or
owned by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and
no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, SpinCo or the holders of Merger Sub, each
share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



-18- Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall designate a nationally recognized commercial bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to Parent to act as agent (the "Exchange Agent")
for the benefit of the holders of Shares who exchange their Shares in
accordance with this Section 2.03. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance with
this Section 2.03 promptly after the Effective Time, book-entry shares
representing the Merger Consideration issuable to holders of Shares as of the
Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.02(a) (such book-entry shares of Parent
Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and other amounts payable in accordance
with Section 2.03(e), the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant
to irrevocable instructions from Parent, deliver the Merger Consideration out
of the Exchange Fund. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested
by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; provided that (i) no such
investment of or losses thereon shall relieve Parent from making the payments
required by this Section 2.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement, or affect the
amount payable in respect of the Shares, and following any losses Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent in the amount of any
such losses, and (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could
prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Any interest
or other income from such investments shall be paid to and become income of
Parent. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than as
specified in this Section 2.03(a).

 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to distribute the shares of Parent Common Stock into which
the Shares have been converted pursuant to the Merger, which, in the case of
Shares distributed in the Distribution, shall be distributed on the same basis
as Shares were distributed in the Distribution and to the Persons who
received Shares in the Distribution. Each holder of Shares shall be entitled
to receive in respect of the Shares held by such Person a book-entry
authorization representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Section 2.03(b)
(and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, as contemplated
by Section 2.03(e), and any dividends or distributions and other amounts
pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to
vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to Parent Common Stock
held by it from time to time hereunder, except as contemplated by Section
2.03(c).

 

(c) Subject to the following sentence, no dividends or other distributions
declared after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock shall
be paid with respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock that are not able to
be distributed by the Exchange Agent promptly after the Effective Time,
whether due to a legal impediment to such distribution or otherwise. Subject
to the effect of abandoned property, escheat, Tax or other Applicable Laws,
following the distribution of any such previously undistributed shares of
Parent Common Stock, there shall be paid to the record holder of such shares
of Parent Common Stock, without interest, (i) at the time of the
distribution, the amount of cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.03(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore

 



-19-  paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock; and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the distribution of
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and a payment date subsequent to the
distribution of such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(d) All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the exchange of SpinCo
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.03 (including any
cash paid pursuant to Section 2.03(c) or Section 2.03(e)) shall be deemed to
have been issued or paid, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of SpinCo Common Stock.

(e) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued on conversion
of SpinCo Common Stock, and such fractional share interests will not entitle
the owner thereof to vote, or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent.
All fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that a holder of shares of
SpinCo Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the
Merger shall be aggregated by the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall
cause the whole shares obtained thereby to be sold on behalf of such
holders of shares of SpinCo Common Stock that would otherwise be entitled to
receive such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger,
in the open market or otherwise, in each case at then-prevailing market
prices, and in no case later than five Business Days after the time of the
Distribution. The Exchange Agent shall make available the net proceeds
thereof, subject to the deduction of the amount of any withholding Taxes as
contemplated in Section 2.03(i) and brokerage charges, commissions and
conveyance and similar Taxes, on a _pro rata_ basis, without interest, as soon
as practicable to the holders of SpinCo Common Stock that would otherwise be
entitled to receive such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
the Merger.

(f) The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or
SpinCo Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or SpinCo Common Stock (other
than (i) issuance of stock by SpinCo in connection with the Separation or
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Separation Agreement
and (ii) any extraordinary cash dividends with respect to SpinCo Common Stock)
with a record date occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 2.03(f) shall be
construed to permit SpinCo, Parent or Merger Sub to take any action with
respect to its securities that otherwise is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including proceeds of any investment
thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares on the
date that is twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not theretofore
received shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Section 2.03
shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration to which
they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(a), any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section
2.03(e) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent
Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.03(c) (subject
to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law).

 



-20- (h) None of Parent, the Company, SpinCo, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for
any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund (or dividends or distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock) or other cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable
Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares
as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(i) Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of
the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Merger
Sub, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of SpinCo Common Stock in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

 

(j) From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of SpinCo
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares thereafter on the records of SpinCo.

 

Section 2.04. _Governance_. (a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent
Board to, take all necessary action to cause three individuals designated by
the Company (the "New Board Designees") to be appointed to the Parent Board as
of the Effective Time, including by increasing the size of the Parent Board
and appointing the New Board Designees to fill the resulting vacancies.

(b) Each of the New Board Designees shall qualify as an "independent
director" under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee of
the Parent Board (the "Committee"). In selecting the New Board Designees, the
Company shall consider in good faith the Committees director criteria for
election of independent directors to the Parent Board. If the Committee
determines, after consultation in good faith with the Company, that any
New Board Designee is not reasonably acceptable, the Company may propose
another individual as a New Board Designee, at which point the review and
consultation process will be repeated until three New Board Designees have
satisfied the requirements above.

(c) At the direction of the Company, (x) one New Board Designee selected by
the Company (the "Initial New Board Designee") shall be assigned to the class
of directors that is up for reelection at the first annual meeting of Parents
stockholders that occurs after the Effective Time, (y) one New Board
Designee selected by the Company shall be assigned to the

 



-21-  class of directors that is up for reelection at the second annual meeting of
Parents stockholders that occurs after the Effective Time and (z) one New
Board Designee selected by the Company shall be assigned to the class of
directors that is up for reelection at the third annual meeting of Parents
stockholders that occurs after the Effective Time.

 

(d) If the Effective Time occurs:

 

(i) after the date that is six months prior to the date of the 2019 annual
meeting of Parents stockholders (the "Parent 2019 Stockholders Meeting") and
prior to the date on which Parent commences mailing its proxy statement for
the Parent 2019 Stockholders Meeting (the "Parent 2019 Proxy Mailing Date"),
then Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent Board to, take all necessary
action to (i) nominate the Initial New Board Designee for election to the
Parent Board at the Parent 2019 Stockholders Meeting, (ii) recommend that
Parents stockholders vote in favor of the election of the Initial New Board
Designee to the Parent Board at the Parent 2019 Stockholder Meeting and (iii)
use no less rigorous efforts to support the election of the Initial New Board
Designee to the Parent Board at the Parent 2019 Stockholder Meeting than the
efforts used to support the election of each other nominee of the Parent Board
for election to the Parent Board at the Parent 2019 Stockholder Meeting; or

 

(ii) after the Parent 2019 Proxy Mailing Date and prior to the Parent 2019
Stockholder Meeting, then Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent Board to,
take all necessary action to cause the Initial New Board Designee to be re-
appointed to the Parent Board as of immediately following the Parent
2019 Stockholder Meeting (and to be re-assigned to the class of directors
that was elected at the Parent 2019 Stockholder Meeting).

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement, from and after the Effective Time, the rights set
forth in Section 2.04(d) shall inure solely to the benefit of, and shall
solely be enforceable by, the Initial New Board Designee, and shall neither
inure to the benefit or, nor be enforceable by, the Company or any other
Person.

this Agreement, the Separation Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

of the outstanding shares of SpinCo Common Stock is the only vote of the
holders of shares of SpinCo Common Stock necessary to adopt this Agreement or

obligations of SpinCo or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any SpinCo Securities.

 

Section 4.06. _Subsidiaries_. (a)Each Transferred Subsidiary is duly
organized, validly existing and (where applicable) in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each Transferred Subsidiary is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Tiger Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, all of the outstanding capital stock of or
other voting securities of, or ownership interests in, each Transferred
Subsidiary, will be owned by SpinCo (or, in the case of the Direct Sale
Transferred Subsidiaries, Direct Sale Purchaser), directly or

 



-25-  indirectly, free and clear of all Liens. Other than such capital stock of or

of, any capital stock or other voting securities of, or ownership interests
in, any Transferred Subsidiary (the items in clauses (i) through (iii) being
referred to collectively as the "Tiger Subsidiary Securities"). As of the
Effective Time, there will be no outstanding obligations of SpinCo or any of
the Transferred Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
of the Tiger Subsidiary Securities. Except for its interests in the
Transferred Subsidiaries and the Tiger JVs, as of the Effective Time, SpinCo
will not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interest in, any Person.

at the Effective Time will be, owned by SpinCo, Direct Sale Purchaser or one
of the Transferred Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of SpinCo as of the date of
this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of such respective
certificates of incorporation, bylaws, limited liability company agreements
or similar organizational documents made available to Parent prior to the date
of this Agreement, there are no outstanding options, warrants, convertible
debt, other convertible instruments or other commitments obligating any Tiger
JV to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, convertible
debt, other convertible instrument or other right, agreement, arrangement or

Section 4.07. _Financial Statements_. (a)Set forth on Section 4.07 of the
SpinCo Disclosure Schedule are copies of the unaudited balance sheets of the
Tiger Business as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, and the unaudited pre-tax
statements of income of the Tiger Business for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 (collectively, the "Tiger Unaudited
Financial Statements"). The Tiger Unaudited Financial Statements were derived
from the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
were prepared on a carve-out basis in accordance with GAAP, consistently
applied, subject to the absence of footnotes and income tax adjustments, as at
the date and for the period presented, and present fairly in all material
respects the financial position and pre-tax results of operations of the Tiger
Business as at the dates and for the periods presented (it being understood,
however, that the Tiger Business has not been operating historically as a
separate entity and, therefore, the Tiger Unaudited Financial Statements
reflect certain adjustments necessary to be presented on a carve-out basis).
From January 1, 2015 to the date of this Agreement, the Company has not
received written notice from the SEC or any other Governmental Authority
indicating that any of its accounting policies or practices, insofar as they
relate to the Tiger Business, are the subject of any review, inquiry,
investigation or challenge by the SEC or any other Governmental Authority.

 



-26- (b) When delivered pursuant to Section 6.05, the Audited
Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements, as applicable,
shall: (i) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied,
(ii) except as set forth on Section 6.05 of the SpinCo Disclosure Schedule,
present fairly in all material respects the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of the Tiger Business as at the dates and for the
periods presented (subject to year-end adjustments, in the case of
the Interim Financial Statements) (it being understood, however, that the
Tiger Business has not been operating historically as a separate entity and,
therefore, the Audited Financial Statements and the Interim Financial
Statements will reflect certain adjustments necessary to be presented on a
carve-out basis in accordance with GAAP and the rules and regulations of the
SEC), and (iii) have been prepared in conformity in all material respects to
the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to the annual and quarterly,
as applicable, financial statements of the Tiger Business required to be
included in the Registration Statements, the Proxy Statement and, if
applicable, the Schedule TO.

 

(c) As of December 31, 2017, the amount of Factored Customer Receivables
(as such term is defined in the Separation Agreement, provided that such
calculation is made as of December 31, 2017 instead of the Distribution
Effective Time) was $150,170,214, and the amount of Gross Factored Receivables
(as such term is defined in the Separation Agreement, provided that such
calculation is made as of December 31, 2017 instead of the Distribution
Effective Time) was $237,051,904.

 

(d) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act) with respect to the
Tiger Business. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
that material information relating to the Tiger Business is made known to
the Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
by others within the Tiger Business. Such disclosure controls and procedures
are effective in timely alerting the Companys principal executive officer and
principal financial officer to material information required to be included
in the Companys periodic and current reports required under the 1934 Act with
respect to the Tiger Business. __ For the avoidance of doubt, such disclosure
controls and procedures are maintained (and determinations of materiality for
purposes of such disclosure controls and procedures are made) on a Company-
wide basis and not separately with respect to the Tiger Business.

 

(e) Since January 1, 2015, with respect to the Tiger Business, the Company
and its Subsidiaries (including SpinCo and the Transferred Subsidiaries) have
established and maintained a system of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act) sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys financial
reporting and the preparation of the Company financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to the
Companys auditors and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information with respect to the Tiger
Business and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other 

 



-27-  employees who have a significant role in internal controls over financial
reporting with respect to the Tiger Business. The Company has made available
to Parent a summary of any such disclosure made by management to the
Companys auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2015. For the
avoidance of doubt, such internal controls over financial reporting are
maintained (and determinations of significant deficiencies,
material weaknesses and employees who have a significant role in internal
controls are made) on a Company-wide basis and not separately with respect to
the Tiger Business.

 

(f) Each of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer
of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company, as applicable) have made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the 1934 Act and Sections 302 and
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, and the statements
contained in any such certifications are complete and correct.

 

Section 4.08. _Registration Statement_. The information supplied by the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration

Registration Statement, at the time each Registration Statement is declared
or becomes effective, (b) with respect to the Parent Registration Statement,

mailed to stockholders of the Company, (c) with respect to the Proxy
Statement, at the time the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) is first mailed to the stockholders of Parent, (d) at the
time of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, (e) at the time the Schedule TO is
filed with the SEC (if applicable), or (f) at the Effective Time, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. All documents that the Company and SpinCo are responsible for
filing with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Separation Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements will comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
1933 Act and the 1934 Act.

SpinCo, governmental examination or investigation) pending against or, to the
knowledge of SpinCo, threatened against or affecting, the Company or any of

duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA)

Effect. No Action (other than routine claims for benefits) is pending against

Subsidiaries, nor, to Parents knowledge, any other party to a Parent Material

default under the provisions of such Parent Material Contract, and neither

Section 5.21. _Financing_. (a)Parent has delivered to the Company a true,
complete and fully executed copy of a commitment letter dated the date of
this Agreement (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto as in
effect on the date of this Agreement) (as it may be amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the "Parent Commitment Letter"), from Goldman Sachs
Bank USA (together with any other commitment parties or Affiliates thereof
from time to time party to the Parent Commitment Letter, the "Lenders") and
true, complete and fully executed copies of all associated fee letters dated
the date of this Agreement (except that such copies of such fee letters may be
redacted in a customary manner to remove fees, economic terms, "market flex"
provisions and other customarily redacted provisions set forth therein so long
as such redacted information does not contain terms relating to the
conditionality or availability of the Financing or the aggregate amount of
the financing) (as they may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
"Fee Letters"), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, among other things, the Lenders party thereto
have committed to Parent to provide Parent with debt financing in the amount
set forth therein (the debt financing contemplated by the Parent Commitment
Letter being referred to as the "Financing"). As of the date of this
Agreement, (x) the Parent Commitment Letter and the Fee Letters have not been
amended, waived or modified, and (y) the commitments contained in the Parent
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any
respect. As of the date of this Agreement, except for the Parent Commitment
Letter and, so long the provisions of the Fee Letters would not adversely
affect the amount or availability of the Financing on the Closing Date, the
Fee Letters, there are no side letters or other contracts, instruments or
other commitments, obligations or arrangements (whether written or oral) to
which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party containing
conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of the Financing.

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Parent Commitment Letter, in the
form so delivered, is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto (in each case, subject to the Bankruptcy Exceptions). As
of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would (i) constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or, to Parents knowledge, any other party thereto under any
term or condition of the Parent Commitment Letter, (ii) assuming satisfaction
of the conditions precedent set forth in Article IX of this Agreement,
constitute or result in a failure to satisfy a condition precedent set forth
in the Parent Commitment Letter, or (iii) to Parents knowledge and assuming
satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Article IX of this
Agreement, otherwise result in any portion of the Financing being unavailable
to Parent on the Closing Date. The proceeds of the Financing under the Parent
Commitment Letter (together with unrestricted cash on hand of Parent and its
Subsidiaries) will provide Parent and its Subsidiaries with financing
sufficient to pay the Direct 

 



-51-  Sale Purchase Price and to pay or reimburse all fees and expenses
contemplated to be paid by Parent or its Subsidiaries hereunder (collectively,
the "Financing Obligations");  _provided_ that between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall maintain
unrestricted cash in an amount that, together with the proceeds of the
Financing, would be sufficient to pay the Financing Obligations. As of the
date of this Agreement, other than as set forth in the Parent Commitment
Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, and assuming satisfaction of
the conditions precedent set forth in Article IX of this Agreement, Parent has
no reason to believe that any of the conditions precedent to the funding of
the Financing will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing
will not be fully available to Parent as set forth in the Parent Commitment
Letter.

 

Section 5.22. _Finders_ __ _Fees_. There is no investment banker, broker,
finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to

Company or any of its Affiliates.

received the opinion of Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC, financial advisor to Parent,

antitakeover plan or other similar device in effect, to which Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound. As of the Effective Time,

Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
not be required to provide or cause to be provided access to or disclose or
cause to be disclosed information where such access or disclosure would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege, contravene any Applicable Law or

the Company.

 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall
instruct its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions or negotiations with any Third Party and its

of the foregoing in this clause (iii), an "Adverse Recommendation Change"),
(iv) either fail to enforce, or grant any waiver or release under, any

of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries unless the Parent Board determines,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law, (v)
approve any transaction under, or any Person becoming an
"interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of Delaware Law, or (vi) enter
into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument
relating to an Acquisition Proposal or consummate any Acquisition Proposal.
It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions on Parent set forth in
this Section by any Subsidiary of Parent or any Representative of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section by Parent.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 7.04(a), at any time prior to the receipt
of the Parent Stockholder Approval:

(i) Parent, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (A)
engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party and its
Representatives that, subject to Parents compliance with Section 7.04(a), has
made after the date of this Agreement a _bona fide_ , written
Acquisition Proposal that the Parent Board reasonably determines is or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) furnish to such
Third Party or its Representatives non-public information relating to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (a copy of
which shall be provided for informational purposes only to the Company) with
such Third Party with terms that Parent determines in good faith are no less
favorable to Parent than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and
that include standstill obligations that Parent reasonably determines are
customary and expressly allow Parent to comply with its obligations under 

 



-61-  this Section 7.04; _provided_ that all such information (to the extent that
such information has not been previously provided or made available to the
Company) is provided or made available to the Company prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to
such Third Party; and

 

(ii) Subject to compliance with Section 7.04(a) and Section 7.04(d), the
Parent Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change (A) following receipt
of a Superior Proposal or (B) in response to an Intervening Event,

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) only if the
Parent Board determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Parent Board from
complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal so long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is
consistent with this Section 7.04; _provided_ that any such action taken
or statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to
be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Parent Board reaffirms the
Parent Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such
action.

 

(c) Parent shall advise the Company on a prompt basis of the status and
terms of any discussions and negotiations referred to in Section 7.04(b) with
the Third Party. In addition, Parent shall notify the Company promptly (but in
no event later than the next Business Day) after receipt by Parent (or any of
its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party that has made, is seeking to make or
would reasonably be expected to make, an Acquisition Proposal. Parent shall
provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party
making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed, on
a prompt basis, of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request and shall promptly (but in no event later than the next
Business Day after receipt) provide to the Company copies of all
correspondence and written materials sent or provided to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives that describes any
material terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal (as well as
written summaries of any oral communications addressing such matters). Any
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of Parents compliance with this Section
7.04(c).

 

(d) Further, the Parent Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation
Change, unless (i) if such Adverse Recommendation Change is to be taken in
circumstances involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) Parent promptly
provides written notice to the Company at least five Business Days before
taking such action of its intention to do so, containing (A) in the case of
any action intended to be taken in circumstances involving an Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, including the most
current version of the proposed agreement under which such Acquisition
Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the Third Party
making the Acquisition Proposal or (B) in the case of any action to be taken
in circumstances where

 



-62-  there has been an Intervening Event, a reasonably detailed description of
the underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons for taking, such action,
and (iii) the Company does not make, within five Business Days after its
receipt of that written notification, an offer that (A) in the case of any
action intended to be taken in circumstances involving an Acquisition
Proposal, is at least as favorable to the stockholders of Parent as such
Acquisition Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal shall
require a new written notification from Parent and will give rise to
an additional notice period under this Section 7.04(d) ending on the later of
(x) the expiration of the original five Business Day notice period and (y)
three Business Days following such new written notification) or (B) in the
case of any action to be taken in circumstances where there has been an
Intervening Event, obviates the need for taking such action. Parent agrees
that, during the five-Business Day period referred to in this Section 7.04(d)
(and three Business Day period in respect of a subsequent revised Acquisition
Proposal), Parent and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with
the Company and its Representatives regarding any revisions proposed by the
Company to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means
an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal for a majority of the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock or a majority of the consolidated assets of
Parent and its Subsidiaries on terms that the Parent Board determines by a
majority vote, after considering the advice of a financial advisor and
outside legal counsel and taking into account all the terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation (and expected timing
of consummation relative to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
are more favorable to Parents stockholders than as provided hereunder (taking
into account any proposal by the Company to amend the terms of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.04(d)), which the Parent Board determines is reasonably
likely to be consummated and for which financing, if a cash transaction
(whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be available by the Parent Board.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Intervening Event" means material
events or changes in circumstances (i) the existence or consequences of which
were not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, Parent as of or prior to the
date hereof and (ii) that do not relate to or involve any Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ that in no event shall any changes resulting from the
following constitute or be deemed to contribute to or otherwise be taken into
account in determining whether there has been an Intervening Event: (A)
changes (or proposed changes) in GAAP, the regulatory accounting requirements
applicable to any industry in which the Company, SpinCo or any of their
respective Subsidiaries operate or Applicable Law, in each case to the extent
affecting the Tiger Business, (B) changes in the financial, credit or
securities markets (including changes in prevailing interest rates, credit
availability and liquidity, currency exchange rates, price levels or trading
volumes in any securities market) or general economic or political conditions,
in each case to the extent affecting the Tiger Business, (C) changes or
conditions generally affecting the industry or segments thereof in which the
Company, SpinCo or any of their respective Subsidiaries operate, in each case
to the extent affecting the Tiger Business, (D) acts of war, sabotage or
terrorism or natural disasters, in each case to the extent affecting the Tiger
Business, (E) the announcement of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Separation Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (including the
Internal Reorganization, the SpinCo Transfer, the Direct Sale, the
Distribution and the Merger) or the 

 



-63-  identity of the parties hereto, including, in each case, with respect to
employees, customers, distributors, suppliers, financing sources, landlords,
licensors and licensees , (F) (1) any failure by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Tiger Business to
meet any internal or published budgets, projections, forecasts or predictions
of financial performance for any period or (2) any change in Parents or the
Companys stock price or trading volume (it being understood that the
underlying cause of, or factors contributing to, any such failure or change
referred to in clause (1) or (2) may be taken into account in determining
whether an Intervening Event has occurred, unless such underlying cause or
factor would otherwise be excepted by another clause of this definition), (G)
actions required or expressly contemplated by this Agreement to be taken by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, SpinCo or any of their respective
Affiliates, (H) actions taken by the Company, SpinCo or any of their
respective Affiliates at the written direction of, or with the written consent
of, Parent or (I) any stockholder or derivative litigation arising from or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(g) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party
and its Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any
such Third Party (together with its Representatives) that has executed a
confidentiality agreement within the 12-month period prior to the date hereof
and that is in possession of confidential information heretofore furnished by
or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other
materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that contains, reflects or
analyzes that information) to return or destroy all such information as
promptly as practicable. Parent represents and warrants to the Company that,
during the 12-month period prior to the date hereof, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries has granted any waiver or release under any standstill or
similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(h) Parent shall promptly inform its directors, officers and financial
advisors, and shall cause its Subsidiaries promptly to inform their
respective directors, officers and financial advisors, of the obligations
under this Section 7.04.

 

Section 7.05. _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 

Section 7.06. _Director and Officer Liability_. (a)For six years after the
Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and
former officers and directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries who
are Tiger Service Providers (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect of acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest
extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or provided under
the Companys or such Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation or bylaws in
effect on the date hereof.

 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations and each
Transferred Subsidiarys certificate of

 



-64-  incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation or any Transferred Subsidiary) regarding
elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors
and employees and advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the
intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the
date of this Agreement.

 

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.06.

 

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.06 shall be
in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of SpinCo or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with SpinCo or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries. These
rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 

Section 7.07. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as part
of the Merger Consideration to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
subject to official notice of issuance.

 

Section 7.08. _Employee Matters_. With respect to employee matters, the
parties hereto have made the agreements and covenants set forth in the
Employee Matters Agreement, which shall be binding on the parties hereto in
accordance with the terms thereof.

be disclosed information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege, contravene any Applicable Law or contravene any
confidentiality undertaking.

 

(b) Any information obtained pursuant to this Section 7.09 shall be subject
to the Confidentiality Agreement,  _provided_ that the term thereof shall be
deemed to extend through the second anniversary of this Agreement in respect

"control share acquisition," "business combination" or other form of
antitakeover Applicable Law shall become applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective boards of
directors shall use all reasonable efforts to grant such approvals and take
such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 7.11. _Defense of Litigation_. On a reasonably prompt basis,

compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any such Action arising
or resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or consent

parties to perform their respective obligations hereunder, or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby in a timely manner.

 

Section 7.12. _Release from Credit Support Instruments_. (a)Parent shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to secure

SpinCo and the Transferred Subsidiaries) from the Company Credit Support
Instruments, including those identified on Section 7.12 of the SpinCo
Disclosure Schedule, at or prior to the Closing Date, including effecting such

one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for each of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than SpinCo and the Transferred

performance obligations under any Company Credit Support Instrument from
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, (x) if requested by the Company, perform such obligations on behalf of the
Company; and (y) otherwise take such action as requested by the Company so as
to put the Company or its applicable Subsidiary in the same position as if
Parent, or such Affiliate of Parent, and not the Company or its applicable
Affiliate, had performed or was performing such obligations. All costs and
expenses incurred by any party in connection with the release or substitution
of such Company Credit Support Instruments shall be borne by Parent. From and
after the Closing, Parent shall indemnify the Company and its Subsidiaries
fully in respect of any and all liabilities, claims, losses, damages, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties (including reasonable
attorneys and consultants fees and expenses) incurred by such Person to the
extent arising from any Company Credit Support Instruments from and after the
Closing.

 



-66- (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the

(i) the Company may, in its sole discretion, take any action to terminate,
obtain release of or otherwise limit its liability under any and all
outstanding Company Credit Support Instruments and (ii) neither the Company
nor any of its applicable Affiliates will have any obligation to renew any
guarantees, letters of credit, comfort letters, bonds, sureties or other
credit support or assurances issued on behalf of any of SpinCo, the
Transferred Subsidiaries or the Tiger Business after the expiration thereof.

 

Section 7.13. _Faiveley Shareholders Agreement_. From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of (i) the receipt of the Parent Stockholder

Section 8.01. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a)Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Separation Agreement, the Company,

and implementation of the strategy for obtaining any and all necessary
antitrust consents or approvals. No party shall meet or engage in material
conversations with any Governmental Authority or representative of such
Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining any such consent,
authorization, order and approval unless, to the extent
reasonably practicable, it consults with the other party in advance and, to
the extent not precluded by Applicable Law or regulation, offers the other
party the opportunity to participate in such meeting or conversation. The
parties hereto shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to,
take, refrain from taking or cause to be taken any action that it is aware or
should reasonably be aware would have the effect of delaying, impairing or
impeding the receipt of any consent, authorization, order or approval of any
Governmental Authorities.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.01 to the contrary, Parent
shall not be required in connection with its efforts to obtain any antitrust

separate of assets or lines of business or taking any other action (or
otherwise agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with respect to any of its or
any of its Affiliates business, assets or properties or the Tiger Business in
connection with its efforts to obtain any antitrust consents or approvals.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.01 to the contrary, neither the
Company nor SpinCo shall be required, in connection with its efforts to obtain
any antitrust consents or approvals, to (x) litigate, appeal any such
litigation, or enter into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree,
stipulation or agreement with

 



-68-  any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby except that Parent and SpinCo shall be required to litigate, or appeal
any such litigation, to the extent reasonably directed to do so by Parent in
the Parents exercise of its authority pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)_,
(y) effect any disposition, licensing or holding separate of assets or lines
of business or taking any other action (or otherwise agreeing to do any of
the foregoing) with respect to any of its or any of its Affiliates business,

following clause, or (z) effect any disposition, licensing or holding
separate of assets or lines of business or taking any other action (or
otherwise agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with respect to the Tiger
Business that is not in any such case conditioned on the occurrence of the
Closing.

Distribution is effected in whole or in part as an exchange offer, the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, when and as required, a Schedule
TO and other filings pursuant to Rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act (collectively,
the "Schedule TO"). Each of the Company, SpinCo, Parent and Merger Sub shall
use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statements filed with
the SEC declared effective under the 1933 Act or become effective under the
1934 Act, as applicable, as promptly as practicable after such filing, and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to

following the date on which the SEC clears (whether orally or in writing) the
Proxy Statement and, if required by the SEC as a condition to the mailing of
the Proxy Statement, the Parent Registration Statement is declared effective.
Each of Parent and SpinCo and the Company shall also take any action required

Proxy Statement, the Registration Statements, the Schedule TO or any amendment
or supplement thereto shall be filed or mailed to stockholders without the
written consent of all of the parties hereto (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as required by
Applicable Law or in connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change
in accordance with Section 7.04; provided that neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall have any right to consent to the filing of the Schedule TO or any
amendment or supplement thereto to the extent the terms thereof are consistent
with Article 3 of the Separation Agreement.

(b) The Proxy Statement shall (i) state that the Parent Board has approved
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and approved the

after receiving oral or written notice of (i) the time when a Registration
Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement or a Registration Statement has been filed, (ii) the issuance of
any stop order, (iii) the suspension of the qualification for offering or

the Proxy Statement, a Registration Statement or the Schedule TO or SEC
comments thereon or requests by the SEC for additional information. Parent and
the Company shall promptly provide each other with copies of any written
communication from the SEC and convey to each other summaries of any oral
communications with the SEC, in each case, with respect to the Proxy
Statement, the Registration Statements or the Schedule TO and shall cooperate
to prepare appropriate responses thereto (and will provide each other with
copies of any such responses given to the SEC) and make such modifications to
the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statements and the Schedule TO as shall
be reasonably appropriate.

(d) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance
shall be discovered by a party hereto that should be set forth in an
amendment or a supplement to a Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement or
the Schedule TO so that any such document would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, such party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto and
the parties hereto shall cause an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information to be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Applicable Law, disseminated to stockholders.

 

(e) In connection with the filing of the Proxy Statement, the Registration
Statements, the Schedule TO and other SEC filings contemplated hereby, each
of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate with the other to prepare pro forma financial statements that comply
with the rules and regulations of the SEC to the extent required for such
filings, including the requirements of Regulation S-X and (ii) provide and
make reasonably available upon reasonable notice the senior management
employees of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to discuss the
materials prepared and delivered pursuant to this Section 8.02(e).

before issuing any press release, having any communication with the press
(whether or not for attribution), making any other public statement or
scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or analysts
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and,
except in respect of any public statement or press release as either Parent or
the Company may determine is required by Applicable Law or any listing
agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or association,
shall not issue any such press release or make any such other public statement
or schedule any such press conference or conference call before such
consultation.

Section 8.04. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized
to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of SpinCo or Merger Sub, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of SpinCo or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to
vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets of SpinCo acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 

Section 8.05. _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent
shall promptly notify the other of: 

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Tiger Business or Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on the date
of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant
to any Section of this Agreement or that relate to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 8.06. _Confidentiality_. Subject to Section 8.11(d), the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and shall
continue in full force and effect until the later of (a) the expiration of the
Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms and (b) the second
anniversary of the date hereof; provided, however, that, upon the Closing,
the confidentiality obligations of Parent contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate in respect of that portion of the Evaluation
Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) exclusively relating
to the Tiger Business. Parent and the Company agree that the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement are hereby amended by the preceding sentence and
Section 8.11(d).

 



-71- Section 8.07. _Tax Matters_. (a)This Agreement is intended to constitute
a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3 and the parties hereto hereby adopt it as such. From
and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each party
hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the Tax-Free Status of
the External Transactions, including causing each of the Distribution and the
Merger to qualify, and will not knowingly take any action, cause or permit
any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to
be taken, which action or failure to act could prevent the Tax-Free Status of
the External Transactions, including preventing the Distribution from
qualifying as a distribution to which Section 355(a) of the Code applies or
the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective Time, none of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent nor any of their respective Affiliates shall
knowingly take any action, cause or permit any action to be taken, fail to
take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or
failure to act could cause the Distribution to fail to qualify as a
distribution to which Section 355(a) of the Code applies or the Merger to fail
to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code or otherwise prevent the parties from achieving the Tax-Free Status of
the External Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the taking
of any action expressly required to be taken by, nor the failure to take any
action expressly prohibited by, this Agreement, the Separation Agreement, the
Tax Matters Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements shall be a breach of this
Section 8.07(a).

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts in order for (i) Parent to obtain the opinion of
Parent Tax Counsel (or, if Parent Tax Counsel is unwilling or unable to issue
the opinion, a written opinion of an Alternative Tax Counsel reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company), in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that, on the
basis of the facts and customary representations and assumptions set forth or
referred to in such opinion and the Tax Representation Letters and on the
assumption that the conclusion in clause (iii) of this Section 8.07(b) is
correct, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes the Merger will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that
each of Parent, Merger Sub and SpinCo will be a party to the reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code (the "Parent Merger Tax
Opinion"); (ii) the Company to obtain the opinion of Company Tax Counsel (or,
if Company Tax Counsel is unwilling or unable to issue the opinion, a written
opinion of an Alternative Tax Counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Company), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, dated as
of the Closing Date, to the effect that, on the basis of the facts and
customary representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such
opinion and the Tax Representation Letters and on the assumption that the
conclusion in clause (iii) of this Section 8.07(b) is correct, for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that each of Parent,
Merger Sub and SpinCo will be a party to the reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code (the "Company Merger Tax Opinion");
(iii) the Company to obtain the opinion of Company Tax Counsel (or a written
opinion of an Alternative Separation Opinion Tax Counsel in the event that
either (x)(I) the Ruling has been received but (II) Company Tax Counsel is
unwilling or unable to issue the opinion or (y)(I) the Ruling has not been
received and the transaction is required to be restructured pursuant to
Section 8.07(f) but (II) Company Tax Counsel is unwilling or unable to issue
the opinion with respect to such restructured transaction), in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the 

 



-72-  Company, dated as of the Closing Date, on the basis of the facts and
customary representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such
opinion and the Tax Representation Letters, as to the Tax-Free Status of the
External Transactions, including that for U.S. federal income Tax purposes,
(A) the SpinCo Transfer and Distribution, taken together, will constitute
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and each
of the Company and SpinCo will be a party to the reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code and (B) the Distribution, as such, will
qualify as a distribution of the SpinCo Common Stock to the Companys
shareholders pursuant to Section 355(a) of the Code (the "Company Separation
Tax Opinion" and, together with the Company Merger Tax Opinion, the "Company
RMT Tax Opinions"); and (iv) any Tax opinions required to be filed with the
SEC in connection with the filing of the Registration Statement to be timely
filed. In the event that any party becomes aware of any fact that may be
inconsistent with the Tax-Free Status of the External Transactions, such party
shall, as soon as practicable, notify the other parties of such fact.

 

(c) Parent, the Company and SpinCo, and others, if required, shall execute
and deliver to Company Tax Counsel, Parent Tax Counsel, an Alternative Tax
Counsel or an Alternative Separation Opinion Tax Counsel, as the case may be,
the Tax Representation Letters as of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) the date
for filing any Tax opinion required to be filed with the SEC in connection
with the filing of either of the Registration Statements; provided, however,
that (x) it shall not be a breach of this Section 8.07(c) if a Person is
unable to make a representation by reason of the fact that such Person does
not believe such representation to be accurate and (y) each of the Company and
Parent, respectively, shall be entitled to a reasonable amount of time to
provide the other party with written comments to the Tax Representation
Letters in support of the Company RMT Tax Opinions and the Parent Merger Tax
Opinion, respectively.

(d) Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall, or shall cause
SpinCo to, deliver to Parent (i) a certificate from SpinCo, dated as of the
Closing Date and prepared in accordance with Treasury Regulations sections
1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3), stating that equity interests in SpinCo are
not "United States real property interests," together with (ii) notice of such
certificate to the IRS in accordance with Treasury Regulations section
1.897-2(h) (which notice shall be mailed to the IRS by SpinCo following the
Closing in accordance with Treasury Regulations section 1.897-2(h)), in case
of clause (i) and (ii), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent.

 

(e) Section 3 of the Form of Tax Matters Agreement is hereby incorporated
in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein.

(f) In the event that the Ruling has not been obtained at the time that all
of the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than the Company Separation
Tax Opinion Condition) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible,
waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions or,
with respect to conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, are able to be satisfied at such time (the date on which such time
occurs, as mutually agreed in good faith by the parties, the "Restructuring
Commencement Date"), then (x) the Company shall distribute (and not retain)
such number of shares of SpinCo Common Stock as would permit the Company
Separation Tax Opinion to be issued without receipt of the Ruling, and (y) if
and to the extent consistent with the satisfaction of the Company Separation
Tax

 



-73-  Opinion Condition, the Company and Parent shall modify the Internal
Reorganization such that the amount of the Basis Adjustments (as defined in
the Form of Tax Matters Agreement) approximates as closely as reasonably
possible the amount of Basis Adjustments that would have resulted if the
Section 336(e) Elections (as defined in the Form of Tax Matters Agreement) had
been made (and the parties agree to negotiate in good faith any amendments to
this Agreement, the Separation Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement that are
necessary or appropriate as a result of the foregoing restructuring and/or
modification); _provided_ that, if Company Tax Counsel, after consulting
with Parent Tax Counsel, reasonably determines that the Ruling will be
obtained within 30 days following the Restructuring Commencement Date and
delivers to Parent a written notice to this effect, then the Restructuring
Commencement Date shall, on a single occasion, be postponed for 30 days.

(g) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement
shall not govern Tax matters (including any administrative, procedural and
related matters thereto), which shall be exclusively governed by the Tax
Matters Agreement.

 

Section 8.08. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each
party shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of SpinCo Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to SpinCo
Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by Article 2 of this Agreement by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act
with respect to SpinCo and will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the 1934 Act.

 

Section 8.09. _Control of other Party_ __ _s Business_. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give the Company or SpinCo, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct any of the operations of Parent or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct any of the operations of the Company, SpinCo, the Transferred
Subsidiaries or the Tiger Business prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing,
each of the Company, SpinCo, Parent and Merger Sub shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its own operations.

 

Section 8.10. _Further Actions_. (a)Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be

cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under Applicable Law to execute and deliver the Ancillary
Agreements and such other documents and other papers as may be required to
carry out the provisions of this Agreement and to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to the
Closing, (i) SpinCo shall not waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in the Separation Agreement without the prior written
consent of Parent; and (ii) any consent, approval, authorization or similar
action to be taken by SpinCo under the Separation Agreement shall be subject
to the prior written consent of Parent.

 



-74- (b) Subject to the applicable terms of the Separation Agreement, from
time to time after the Closing, without additional consideration, each party
hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, execute and deliver such
further instruments and take such other action as may be necessary or is
reasonably requested by another party hereto to make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Separation Agreement.

 

(c) Following the Closing, Parent shall take all action necessary to cause

sole cost and expense, to assist Parent in making any corrective changes of
ownership filings and records with all applicable patent, trademark, and
copyright offices and domain name registrars and other similar authorities
("Corrective Changes") as may be necessary to correct any break or discrepancy
in the chain of title for any material registered Tiger Intellectual Property
Rights, including executing and delivering any applicable documents to effect
any such Corrective Change. From and after the Closing, at Parents sole cost
and expense, Parent shall be responsible for recording, and upon Parents
reasonable request, the Company shall cooperate with SpinCo and the
Transferred Subsidiaries to record, the assignment of any applicable Tiger

Section 8.11. _Financing_. (a)Subject to Section 8.11(b)(ii), Parent
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to
take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange as promptly as reasonably practicable prior to the Closing (i) the
Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Parent Commitment
Letter (including any "market flex" provisions included in the Fee Letters) or
on such other terms that would not be prohibited by Section 8.11(b) or (ii) in
the event all or any portion of the Financing pursuant to the Parent
Commitment Letter becomes unavailable (other than as a result of the existence
of Parent Financing permitted pursuant to Section 8.11(b)(ii)), the
Alternative Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Alternative Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions included
in any fee letter relating thereto) or on such other terms as would not be
prohibited by Section 8.11(b)). Subject to Section 8.11(b)(ii), Parent shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to (A)
maintain the Parent Commitment Letter in effect until the earlier of the
initial funding of the Financing or the effectiveness of the Financing
Agreements (as defined below), (B) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing, on the terms and conditions contained in the Parent
Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions included in the Fee
Letters) or on such other terms that would not be prohibited by Section
8.11(b) (the "Financing Agreements"), and upon the effectiveness thereof,
maintain the Financing Agreements in effect until the initial funding of the
Financing, (C) comply with the obligations that are set forth in the Parent
Commitment Letter that are applicable to Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
and satisfy on a timely basis all conditions precedent to the availability of
the Financing set forth in the Parent Commitment Letter and the Financing
Agreements that are within its control, and (D) fully enforce the rights of
Parent under the Parent Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements. In the
event the Financing in the amounts set forth in the Parent Commitment Letter
or the Financing Agreements, or any portion thereof, becomes unavailable, or
it becomes reasonably likely that it may become unavailable, on

 



-75-  the terms and conditions contemplated in the Parent Commitment Letter
(including any "market flex" provisions included in the Fee Letters) or the
Financing Agreements (in each case, other than as a result of the existence
of Parent Financing permitted pursuant to Section 8.11(b)(ii)), Parent shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain
promptly alternative financing, from the same or alternative financing
sources, in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing
that is available, to allow Parent or its applicable Subsidiary to pay all of
the Financing Obligations (the "Alternative Financing") and which Alternative
Financing shall not contain conditions precedent to the funding thereof that
are less favorable to Parent than the conditions precedent with respect to the
Financing set forth in the Parent Commitment Letter and to obtain, and, when
obtained, to provide promptly to the Company a copy of, a new financing
commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing (the "Alternative
Commitment Letter") and to negotiate definitive agreements with respect
thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein (the "Alternative
Financing Agreements"); _provided_ that the terms of any Alternative Financing
must be (x) consistent with the Tax-Free Status, as reasonably determined by
the Company, and (y) subject to written approval by the Company, whose
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event any
Alternative Financing is obtained, any reference in this Agreement to
"Financing" shall include such Alternative Financing, any reference to "Parent
Commitment Letter" shall include the Alternative Commitment Letter with
respect to such Alternative Financing, any reference to "Lenders" shall
include the financial institutions providing such Alternative Financing, and
any reference to "Financing Agreements" shall include any definitive
agreements with respect to such Alternative Commitment Letter, and all
obligations of each party pursuant to this Section 8.11 shall be applicable
thereto to the same extent as such partys obligations, as the case may be,
with respect to the Financing.

 

(b) (i) Without limitation of the obligations of Parent under this
Agreement, Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice upon it or any
of its Subsidiaries obtaining knowledge of (w) any material breach (or
threatened material breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any material breach or default) by any party to the Parent
Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements; (x) any actual or threatened
withdrawal, repudiation or termination of the Financing by any of the
Lenders; (y) any material dispute or disagreement between or among any of the
parties to the Parent Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements relating
to, or otherwise potentially affecting, the amount or the availability of the
Financing on the Closing Date or satisfaction of the conditions thereunder;
and (z) any amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the Parent
Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements. Parent shall give the Company
prompt written notice if for any reason it believes in good faith that Parent
will not be able to timely obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the
terms and in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Parent
Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements (other than as a result of the
existence of Parent Financing permitted pursuant to Section 8.11(b)(ii)).
Parent shall keep the Company informed in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing, including by providing copies of then-
current drafts of the Financing Agreements and providing copies of all
definitive Financing Agreements, in each case, upon reasonable request (in
each, case, excluding any provisions related solely to fees, economic terms,
"market flex" provisions and other customarily redacted provisions set forth
therein so long as such redacted information does not contain terms relating
to the conditionality or availability of the Financing or the aggregate amount
of the financing). Subject to Section 8.11(b)(ii), Parent shall

 



-76-  not, without the prior written consent of the Company, amend, modify,
supplement, restate, substitute, replace, terminate, or agree to any waiver
under the Parent Commitment Letter in a manner that: (i) adds new or expands
upon the conditions precedent to the funding of the Financing as set forth in
the Parent Commitment Letter, (ii) would reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing provided for under the Parent Commitment Letter, (iii) would limit
the rights and remedies of Parent as against the Lenders or (iv) would
otherwise prevent, impair or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Separation Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, (x)
Parent may implement or exercise any of the "market flex" provisions exercised
by the Lenders in accordance with the Fee Letters as of the date hereof (or,
in respect of any Alternative Financing, in accordance with the "market flex"
provisions exercised by the Lenders in accordance with any fee letter relating
thereto) and (y) additional lenders and financing sources, and Affiliates
thereof, may be added (including in replacement of a Lender) to the Parent
Commitment Letter (or all or a portion of the commitments may be assigned to
new or existing lenders and financing sources) after the date hereof or
thereof and Parent may reallocate commitments or assign or re-assign titles
and roles to or among parties to the Parent Commitment Letter.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Section 8.11 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent shall have the right (i) to substitute
the proceeds of consummated equity offerings or debt offerings or incurrences
of debt for all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Parent
Commitment Letter by reducing commitments under the Parent Commitment Letter
by an amount not in excess of such proceeds, provided that (A) to the extent
any such equity or debt has a scheduled special or mandatory redemption right,
such right is not exercisable prior to the earliest of (x) the Closing Date,
(y) the termination of this Agreement and (z) the End Date and (B) the
conditions to the use of such proceeds shall be no more restrictive than the
conditions precedent to the availability of the Financing set forth in the
Parent Commitment Letter, or (ii) to substitute commitments in respect of
other financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the same or
alternative bona fide third party financing sources, provided that such
other financing (A) does not contain conditions precedent to the funding
thereof that are less favorable to Parent than the conditions precedent with
respect to the Financing set forth in the Parent Commitment Letter, (B) would
not reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Separation Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (including not having
conditions to the use of such proceeds more restrictive than the conditions
set forth in the Parent Commitment) and (C) would not adversely affect the
ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Parent
Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements (any such financing pursuant to
the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the "Parent Financing"), provided that the
proceeds from any such Parent Financing shall be held as unrestricted cash
until the earliest of (x) the Closing Date, (y) the termination of this
Agreement and (z) the End Date. For purposes of this Section 8.11, it being
understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Parent Financing may include
any offering of securities or incurrence of loans or any combination thereof.

 



-77- (c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall (and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to) use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to provide, the
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary, proper or

Financing or the Parent Financing, as applicable. Such cooperation shall

(ii) furnishing to Parent the Audited Financial Statements and the Interim

(iv) using reasonable best efforts to (A) obtain from the independent
accountants for the Tiger Business customary accountants comfort letters

named as an "Expert" in any materials relating to the Financing or the Parent
Financing, as applicable, and (B) cause the independent accountants for the
Tiger Business to provide customary assistance and cooperation in the
Financing or the Parent Financing, as applicable, including using reasonable
best efforts to cause such accountants to participate in a reasonable number
of drafting sessions and accounting due diligence sessions;

 

(v) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including one-on-one
meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters
or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Financing or the
Parent Financing, as applicable, and senior management and Representatives,
with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company, SpinCo and their
respective Subsidiaries), presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the
Financing or the Parent Financing, as applicable, at times and dates
reasonably acceptable to the Company, SpinCo and their respective
Subsidiaries;

with the Financing or the Parent Financing, as applicable, by providing

requested at least 10 Business Days prior to the anticipated closing of the
Financing or the Parent Financing, as applicable.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.11(c), no action

(iii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Parent or Merger Sub set forth in

been satisfied (other than (i) Section 9.01(a) and (ii) those conditions
which by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at the Closing; _provided_

(v) if (A) any Governmental Authority shall have issued any order, decree
or judgment in respect of the matters referenced in Section 9.01(e) or Section

(the "Termination Fee") within one Business Day after such termination.

(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated (x) by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i) (if the Parent Stockholder Approval has not

of Parent and (iii) within 12 months following the date of such termination,
Parent shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
recommended to its stockholders, any Acquisition Proposal or any Acquisition
Proposal shall have been consummated ( _provided_ that for purposes of this
clause (iii), each reference to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%"), then Parent shall pay to
the Company in immediately available funds, concurrently with the occurrence
of the applicable event described in clause (iii), the Termination Fee _less_
the amount of any Expenses reimbursed by Parent pursuant to Section 10.03(d).

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (x) Section 10.01(b)(i) or

of any order, decree or judgment in respect of the matters referenced in
Section 9.01(e) or Section 9.01(f)) and, at the time of such termination, one
or more of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 9.01(e),
Section 9.01(f) or Section 9.01(g) (if the Applicable Law relates to any of
the matters referenced in Section 9.01(e) or Section 9.01(f)) shall not have
been satisfied, but all conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 9.02
(other than those conditions which by their terms or nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing; _provided_ that any conditions not so satisfied are
capable of being satisfied promptly if the Closing were to occur) have been
satisfied or waived, (y) Section 10.01(d)(iii) (in respect of a breach of
Section 8.01 in connection with efforts to obtain antitrust approvals) or (z)
Section 10.01(d)(v), then Parent shall pay to the Company in immediately
available funds the Termination Fee within one Business Day after such
termination.

 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii),
Parent shall reimburse the Company and SpinCo and their respective Affiliates
(by wire transfer of immediately available funds), no later than two Business
Days after submission of written documentation therefor, for 100% of their
Expenses, up to an aggregate maximum reimbursement of $40 million.

 



-86- (e) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein (including in Section
8.11(e) and this Section 10.03), all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

 

(f) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that: (i) the agreements
contained in this Section 10.03 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement; and (ii) any Termination Fee
payable to the Company by Parent pursuant to Section 10.03(a), Section
10.03(b) or Section 10.03(c) is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages in an
amount that shall compensate the Company for the efforts and resources
expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance upon this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein, and for the liability suffered by reason
of the failure of such consummation, which amount would otherwise
be uncertain and incapable of accurate determination. If Parent fails to pay
any amount due to the Company pursuant to this Section 10.03 by the date
required hereby, it shall also pay any costs and expenses reasonably incurred
by the Company or SpinCo in connection with a legal action to enforce this
Agreement that results in a judgment against Parent, together with interest on
the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly announced prime
rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such fee, cost or expense was required
to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date.

(g) The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Parent be
required to pay more than one Termination Fee.

notices, requests and other communications shall be deemed received on the
date of receipt by the recipient thereof if received prior to 5:00 p.m. on a
Business Day. Otherwise, any such notice, request or communication shall be
deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day.

Section 11.02. _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.
The representations, warranties and covenants contained herein and in any
certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the
Effective Time, except for those covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement that by their terms are to be performed in whole or in part after
the Effective Time.

 

Section 11.03. _Amendments and Waivers_. (a)Any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only
if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by
each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided that any
amendments or waiver of this Section 11.03(a), Section 11.05(a), Section
11.06, Section 11.07, Section 11.08 or Section 11.14 (or any other provision
of this Agreement to the extent that a waiver of such provision would modify
the substance of any such Section) (collectively, the "Lender Provisions"), to
the extent adversely affecting any of the Lender Related Parties, shall not be
effective with respect to such affected Lender Related Parties unless such
affected Lender Related Parties provide their prior written consent to such
amendment or modification.

 



-88- (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single
or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

 

Section 11.04. _Disclosure Schedule_. The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Section of either the SpinCo Disclosure Schedule or
the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or,
as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other
representations, warranties and covenants of such party that are contained in
this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception
to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties and
covenants is reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed
therein to the Person to which such disclosure is being made. The mere
inclusion of an item in either the SpinCo Disclosure Schedule or the Parent
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not
be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Tiger Material Adverse Effect or Parent
Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

 

Section 11.05. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. (a) The provisions
of this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section
2.04(e) and Section 7.06, shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 2.04(e)
and Section 7.06, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lender Related Parties are third
party beneficiaries of the Lender Provisions.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto.

 

Section 11.06. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees all litigation, suits,
proceedings, or actions (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise) against any of the Lender Related Parties that may be based
upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any dispute relating to the Financing or the
Parent Financing, shall be exclusively governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to
the conflicts of law rules of such state.

 

Section 11.07. _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any
litigation, suit, proceeding, or action seeking to enforce any provision of,
or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by

 



-89-  any party or any of its Affiliates or against any party or any of its
Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court
shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such litigation, suit,
proceeding, or action and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such litigation, suit, proceeding, or action in any such court or
that any such litigation, suit, proceeding, or action brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such
litigation, suit, proceeding, or action may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on
such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party
hereto agrees (i) that it will not bring or support any litigation, suit,
proceeding, or action against any of the Lender Related Parties that may be
based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any dispute relating to the Financing or the
Parent Financing, in any forum other than the federal court located in the
Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York or, if the federal courts
shall not have subject matter jurisdiction, in the New York state court
located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York, (ii) to
submit and hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for
itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with
regard to any such litigation, suit, proceeding, or action against any of the
Lender Related Parties based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute relating to
the Financing or the Parent Financing, and (iii) to waive and hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any objection which such
party may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such litigation, suit,
proceeding, or action in any such court.

 

Section 11.08. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (INCLUDING AGAINST ANY LENDER RELATED PARTY OR IN RESPECT OF THE
FINANCING OR THE PARENT FINANCING).

 

Section 11.09. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.
Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral
or written agreement or other communication).

Section 11.10. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Separation
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 



-90- Section 11.11. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.12. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur, and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law, in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
(including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby) or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual
damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is
entitled at law or in equity. Each party agrees to waive any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. The
parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, while the Company may pursue both a grant of
specific performance of Parents and Merger Subs obligations pursuant to
this Agreement and the payment of the Termination Fee, the parties agree that
under no circumstances shall the Company or any Person be entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any Termination Fee, unless such grant of
specific performance is not complied with or does not result in the
consummation of the Merger and the Closing pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 11.13. _Limited Liability_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, no stockholder, director, officer, Affiliate, agent or
representative of any of the parties, in its capacity as such, shall have any
liability in respect of or relating to the covenants, obligations,
representations or warranties of such party under this Agreement or in
respect of any certificate delivered with respect hereto or thereto and, to
the fullest extent legally permissible, each of the parties, for itself and
its stockholders, directors, officers and Affiliates, waives and agrees not to
seek to assert or enforce any such liability that any such Person otherwise
might have pursuant to Applicable Law.

 

Section 11.14. _No Recourse to Lender Related Parties_. Without limiting
the rights of Parent under the Parent Commitment Letter or under any
definitive agreements with respect to any Financing or any Parent Financing,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Separation Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, each party hereto
irrevocably agrees that none of the Lender Related Parties shall have any
liability or obligation to

 



-91-  the Company or SpinCo, or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
or their Affiliates respective former, current or future stockholders,
managers, members, controlling persons, general or limited partners,
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
consultants or other agents or advisors, relating to this Agreement, the
Separation Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, the Separation
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, including any dispute relating to the Financing or the Parent
Financing, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in
equity, or otherwise under any legal or equitable theory.
