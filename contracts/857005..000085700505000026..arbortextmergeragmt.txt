accrued compensation and benefits, (D) deferred revenues, (E) deferred taxes,
and (F) Transaction Expenses.  (ii) The Excess Transaction Expenses, as so
certified by Arbortext, shall be a negative Closing Adjustment.  (iii) The

(90) days after the Closing Date, PTC will provide to the Stockholder
Representative a calculation of the Other Liabilities of Arbortext as of the
close of business on the day before the Closing Date. PTC will make available
all records and work papers used in calculating such amounts. If the
Stockholder Representative disagrees with PTC\'s calculation, the Stockholder
Representative may provide a written notice of proposed changes to such
calculation (a "Change Notice") to PTC within thirty (30) days after
the receipt of PTC\'s calculation (and in the event no Change Notice is
provided during such period, the Stockholder Representative will be deemed to
have agreed to and accepted such calculation as of the end of such period).
PTC shall promptly cooperate with the Stockholder Representative in providing
such information as he reasonably requests in connection with the review of
the calculation contemplated by this section, and the Stockholder
Representative\'s thirty (30) day period for reviewing such calculation shall
be extended as is reasonably necessary to enable him to review any such
additional information provided to him after the provision of the original
calculation. If the Stockholder Representative provides a Change Notice to
PTC within such period, the amount of Other Liabilities shall be finally
determined in accordance with Section 1.7(d).  (ii) If the amount of Other
Liabilities as finally determined is greater than the Pre-Closing Other
Liabilities, PTC shall be entitled to receive from the Escrow Funds (as a
Final Claim) an amount equal to the difference. If the amount of Other
Liabilities as finally determined is less than the Pre-Closing
Other Liabilities, PTC shall pay to the Stockholder Representative for the
benefit of the Securityholders an amount equal to the difference.  (d)
Resolution of Disputes. PTC and the Stockholder Representative will attempt
in good faith promptly to resolve any differences with respect to
the calculation under Section 1.7(c) that are raised within the applicable
period. If they are unable to resolve any differences within twenty (20) days
after delivery of the Change Notice, such remaining differences will be
submitted to an Independent Accountant for prompt determination. The
Independent Accountant will determine those matters in dispute and will
render a written report as to the disputed matters, which report shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant in respect of such report shall be paid one-half by
PTC and one-half by the Stockholder Representative.  1.8 Conversion of

Sections 1.9 through 1.12 and Section 8:  (a) Arbortext Stock. The

respect to the Shares and Options listed opposite such Designated
Individual\'s name on Schedule 1.9 shall be delivered to the Stockholder
Representative or held as part of the Escrow Funds, as the case may be,

Dissenters Rights. Shares of Arbortext Stock held as of the Effective Time by

demanded and perfected in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and not
effectively withdrawn or forfeited prior to the Effective Time (collectively,
the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into Merger Consideration,
but shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to
such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL. If a holder of Dissenting Shares
(a "Dissenting Stockholder") forfeits or withdraws his, her or its right to
appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then, (i) as of the occurrence of such event,
such holder\'s Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and
shall be converted into and represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Arbortext Stock pursuant
to Section 1.8, and (ii) promptly following the occurrence of such event, PTC
or the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to such Dissenting Stockholder a
payment representing the Merger Consideration to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 1.8.  1.11 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed
Certificates. In the event any certificate representing Arbortext Stock shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, PTC shall issue the respective Merger
Consideration in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate only
following delivery by the holder thereof of an affidavit of that fact and
such indemnities against any claim that may be made against PTC or its
transfer agent with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed as are customarily requested by institutional transfer
agents.  1.12 Tax Withholding. PTC, Arbortext or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Arbortext Stock or Purchase Rights such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of
Arbortext Stock or Purchase Rights, as the case may be, in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.  1.13 Further Actions. If, at any
time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable

all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Arbortext
and Merger Sub, the officers and directors from time to time of the Surviving
Corporation are fully authorized in the name of Arbortext and Merger Sub, as

consistently with past practices. Since the Interim Balance Sheet Date, no

jurisdictions where it is or has been required to so file, and no claim has
ever been made by any taxing authority in any other jurisdiction that
Arbortext is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Arbortext

applicable laws relating to the payment, collecting, or withholding of Taxes
and the remittance thereof to the relevant Government Entity.  (b) There
are no Liens with respect to Taxes upon any of the assets or properties of
Arbortext or any Subsidiary, other than Permitted Liens with respect to
Taxes.  (c) No audit or other similar examination is currently pending with
respect to any Tax Return of Arbortext or any Subsidiary and neither
Arbortext nor any Subsidiary has received any written communication from any
taxing authority which has caused or should reasonably have caused it to
believe that an audit is forthcoming. No deficiency for any Taxes has been
asserted, proposed, or threatened in writing (or, to the Knowledge of
Arbortext, orally) against Arbortext or any Subsidiary, which deficiency has
not been paid in full. No issue relating to Taxes of Arbortext or any
Subsidiary has been finally resolved in favor of any taxing authority in a
completed Tax audit or examination of Arbortext or any Subsidiary that, by
application of the same principles, Arbortext reasonably expects to result in
the assertion by any taxing authority of a deficiency for Taxes of Arbortext
or any Subsidiary for any other period.  (d) Section 2.10(d) of the
Arbortext Disclosure Schedule lists all United States federal, state and
local, and all foreign income Tax Returns filed with respect to Arbortext and
each Subsidiary for taxable periods ended on or after December 31, 1999, and
indicates those Tax Returns that have been audited or subject to similar
examination by a taxing authority and those Tax Returns that currently are
the subject of audit or such examination. There are no
outstanding agreements, waivers or arrangements extending the statutory
period of limitation (or any other period during which any Tax can be
assessed) applicable to any claim for, or the period for the collection or
assessment of, Taxes due from or with respect to Arbortext or any Subsidiary
for any taxable period, and no power of attorney granted by or with respect
to Arbortext or any Subsidiary relating to Taxes is currently in force.
Arbortext has delivered or otherwise made available to PTC true, complete and
correct copies of all Tax Returns, audit reports, and statements of
deficiencies for each of the last three taxable years filed by or issued to
or with respect to Arbortext and any Subsidiary (or, insofar as such items
relate to Arbortext or any Subsidiary, by or to any affiliated, consolidated,
combined, or unitary group of which Arbortext or any Subsidiary was then a
member).  (e) The unpaid Taxes of Arbortext and any Subsidiary for all
taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending (i) on or before the Interim
Balance Sheet Date did not, as of such date, exceed the reserve for tax
liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the
Interim Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereof) and (ii) on or
before the Effective Date will not, as of the Effective Date, exceed that
reserve as adjusted to reflect the ordinary operations of Arbortext and its
Subsidiaries after the Interim Balance Sheet Date and through the Effective
Date in accordance with the past customs and practice of Arbortext and its
Subsidiaries in filing its Tax Returns.  (f) Neither Arbortext nor any
Subsidiary is a "consenting corporation" within the meaning of former Section
341(f) of the Code, and no consent to the application of former Section
341(f)(2) of the Code (or any predecessor provision) has been made or filed
by or with respect to Arbortext or any Subsidiary or any of their respective
assets or properties. Neither Arbortext nor any Subsidiary has agreed, nor is
it required, to make any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision of applicable state, local, or foreign law) by reason of a
change in accounting method or otherwise. Neither Arbortext nor any
Subsidiary has used the installment method under Section 453 of the Code (or
any similar provision of applicable state, local or foreign law) to defer any
material income to any taxable period ending after the Effective Date. There
is no limitation on the utilization by Arbortext or any Subsidiary of its net
operating losses, built-in losses, tax credits or other similar items under
Section 382, 383, or 384 of the Code (or any similar provision of applicable
state, local, or foreign law) (other than any such limitation arising as a
result of the consummation of the Arbortext Stock purchase as contemplated by
this Agreement).  (g) Neither Arbortext nor any Subsidiary has ever been (i)
a member of any affiliated group filing or required to file a consolidated,
combined, or unitary Tax Return (other than any such group of which Arbortext
is the common parent) or (ii) a party to or bound by, nor does it have or has
it ever had any obligation under, any Tax sharing agreement or similar
contract or arrangement. Neither Arbortext nor any Subsidiary has any
liability for the Taxes of any other Person under U.S. Treasury Regulation
ss.1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of applicable federal, state, local, or
foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.  (h)
Neither Arbortext nor any Subsidiary has distributed to its stockholders or
security holders stock or securities of a controlled corporation in
a transaction to which Section 355 of the Code applies (i) in the two years
before the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could
otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) that includes the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor was Arbortext or any
Subsidiary the subject of any such distribution pursuant to any transaction
with respect to which Arbortext or any Subsidiary has agreed to or is
otherwise obligated to indemnify any person for any Tax resulting from or
attributable to such transaction.  (i) Arbortext is not and has not been
during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the
Code, a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.  (j) Section 2.10(j) of the Disclosure
Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of all outstanding Arbortext
Stock that is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (within the meaning
of Section 83 of the Code), states the date of grant or issuance of such
restricted Arbortext Stock, the fair market value of the Arbortext Stock on
the date of grant, and the amount paid, if any, by such holder for such
restricted Arbortext Stock, and indicates whether Arbortext has received from
the holder of such restricted Arbortext Stock a copy of an election under
Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to suc grant or issuance.  (k) No
U.S. Form 8832 has been filed electing treatment as other than an association
taxable as a corporation for any Subsidiary, and all Subsidiaries are treated
as corporations for U.S. and non-U.S. Tax purposes. No Subsidiary organized
in a jurisdiction outside the United States has made an election to
be treated as a domestic corporation pursuant to Section 897(i) of the Code.
No Subsidiary (other than Advent 3B2 Inc. or Arbortext International Inc.)
conducts any trade or business within the United States or holds an
investment in any United States property (within the meaning of Section 956
of the Code) or any United States real property interest (within the meaning
of Section 897 of the Code).  2.11 Compliance with Laws; Permits.  (a)
Neither Arbortext nor any Subsidiary is or has been in violation of
any order, judgment, injunction, award or decree binding upon it, nor of
any federal, state, local or foreign law, ordinance or regulation
(including, without limitation, laws, regulations or ordinances relating to
environmental matters, employment practices, occupational safety, Tax,
import/export or corrupt practices) of any governmental or regulatory body
applicable to its business or assets, except for any such violations that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Arbortext nor any Subsidiary has received any written (or, to
Arbortext\'s Knowledge, oral) notice or communication from any Governmental
Entity of any such violation or noncompliance, and there has been no
citation, fine or penalty imposed or asserted against Arbortext or any
Subsidiary for any such violation of such laws, regulations or
ordinances.  (b) Arbortext and each Subsidiary has in full force and effect,
and is in compliance in all material respects with, all licenses, permits and
other approvals ("Permits") of any Governmental Entity required for the
conduct of the business of Arbortext and each Subsidiary as presently
conducted. No proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of Arbortext,
threatened to revoke or limit any such Permit.  2.12 Actions and
Proceedings. There is no outstanding order, judgment, injunction, award or
decree of any court, Governmental Entity or arbitration tribunal against or
involving Arbortext or any Subsidiary, any of their respective assets or
properties, or any of their respective directors or officers in their
capacities as such. There is no action, suit or claim, legal, administrative
or arbitration proceeding, or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of
Arbortext, threatened against or involving Arbortext or any Subsidiary, any
of their respective assets or properties or any of their respective directors
or officers in their capacities as such or that in any manner challenges or
seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. To Arbortext\'s Knowledge, there is no fact, event or
circumstance that reasonably could be expected to give rise to any suit,
action, claim, investigation or proceeding that individually or in
the aggregate would have a material adverse effect upon the
transactions contemplated hereby or a Material Adverse Effect.  2.13

Arbortext Disclosure Schedule (which may be by cross-reference to Section
2.16(b) or 2.19(a)). Arbortext has delivered or made available to PTC true
and complete copies of all Material Contracts and all amendments, waivers or
other modifications thereto or, in the case of oral Material Contracts,
complete and accurate descriptions. All of the Material Contracts are valid,
in full force and effect, and binding upon Arbortext or the respective
Subsidiary and, to Arbortext\'s Knowledge, on the other party(ies) thereto.
No written (or, to Arbortext\'s Knowledge, oral) notice of termination or
amendment of any Material Contract has been given to Arbortext or any
Subsidiary by any other party thereto. Arbortext or the respective Subsidiary
and each other party thereto has paid in full or, to Arbortext\'s Knowledge,
accrued all amounts now due from it under each Material Contract and has
satisfied in full or provided for all of its liabilities and obligations
thereunder that are presently required to be satisfied or provided for, and
is not in default under any of them, nor has any event occurred or does any
condition exist that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
default by Arbortext or any Subsidiary or, to Arbortext\'s Knowledge, any
such other party thereunder.  2.14 Real Estate. Neither Arbortext nor any
Subsidiary owns any real property or any buildings or other structures or has
any options or any contractual obligations to purchase or acquire any
interest in real property. All leasehold interests of Arbortext and each
Subsidiary are set forth in Section 2.13(a)(xiv) of the Arbortext Disclosure

common law landlord\'s liens and superior rights of lenders to landlords.
With respect such leasehold interests: (a) there are no disputes, oral
agreements or forbearance programs in effect as to the lease or sublease; (b)
neither Arbortext nor or any Subsidiary has assigned, transferred, conveyed,
mortgaged, deeded in trust or encumbered any interest in the leasehold or

and each Subsidiary, are in good operating condition and repair, reasonable
wear and tear excepted, and have been the subject of normal maintenance
consistently performed, and Arbortext has not received any notice, whether
written, oral or otherwise, that any of such property is in violation of any
existing law or any building, zoning, health, safety or other ordinance, code
or regulation.  2.16 Proprietary Rights.  (a) As used in this Agreement,
"Proprietary Rights" means, collectively, all (i) U.S. and foreign, whether
registered or unregistered, patents, trademarks, trade names, trade dress,
service marks, copyrights, and applications therefor, (ii) computer software
programs or applications (in both source code and object code form), (iii)
industrial models, inventions, invention disclosures, author\'s rights,
designs, utility models, inventor rights, schematics, technology, (iv) trade
secrets, know-how, and other intangible information or material, and
(v) confidential information and any other proprietary data or information of
any nature or form.  (b) Section 2.16(b)(i) and (ii), respectively of the
Arbortext Disclosure Schedule set forth a true, accurate and complete list
of:  (i) all Proprietary Rights owned, licensed, used, or operated under
by Arbortext and/or any Subsidiary and that are material to the business
of Arbortext and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted and as contemplated
to be conducted (the "Arbortext Intellectual Property"), specifying whether
such Proprietary Rights are exclusive or non-exclusive to Arbortext and
its Subsidiaries and including identifying information of all U.S. federal,
state and non-U.S. registrations of such Arbortext Intellectual Property
or applications for registration thereof, provided that, the items listed
in clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of the definition of "Proprietary Rights"
shall not be required to be listed in the Arbortext Disclosure
Schedule;  (ii) all licenses, sublicenses, and royalty, escrow, maintenance,
support and other agreements to which Arbortext and/or any Subsidiary is a
party and pursuant to which Arbortext, any Subsidiary or any other person is
authorized to use, license the use of, distribute or exercise any other
rights with respect to any (A) Arbortext Intellectual Property, or (B) third
party Proprietary Rights that are incorporated in or used by, any Arbortext
products or services, or form a part of any Arbortext Intellectual Property
(collectively, the "Arbortext Licenses"); including but not limited to any
licenses granted by Arbortext or any Subsidiary to modify, distribute,
integrate or bundle any Arbortext software products or software developed or
licensed exclusively by Arbortext ("Arbortext OEM/Reseller Licenses");
provided, however, that customer contracts granting only a non-exclusive,
internal-use, end-user license to object code need not be listed in Section
2.16(b)(ii) of the Arbortext Disclosure Schedule. Section 2.16(b)(i) of the
Arbortext Disclosure Schedule also accurately and completely identifies any
Arbortext OEM/Reseller Licenses (1) which are exclusive in a territory
specifying in what territory they are exclusive and/or (2) under which the
third party licensee holds in its possession inventory of Arbortext
software products, specifying the products held in inventory by name and
version number and stating the number of copies of each such version held in
inventory as of the Interim Balance Sheet Date.  (c) Arbortext or its
Subsidiaries owns, is licensed to use, or otherwise has the full legal right
to use all of the Arbortext Intellectual Property, free and clear of any Lien
(whether arising by contract or by operation of law). Arbortext and each of
its Subsidiaries owns, possesses or otherwise has the right to use all
Arbortext Intellectual Property and, to the Knowledge of Arbortext, all other
Proprietary Rights necessary or required for the conduct of the business of
Arbortext or such Subsidiary, as applicable, as currently conducted and as
contemplated to be conducted, including the development, marketing and
distribution of the existing and currently planned products of Arbortext and
each Subsidiary. Except for the Arbortext Licenses, there are no outstanding
rights or options (whether or not currently exercisable), licenses or
agreements of any kind relating to the Arbortext Intellectual
Property. Except under the Arbortext Licenses, neither Arbortext nor any
Subsidiary is obligated to pay any royalties or other compensation (other
than market rate fees for standard software licenses that are generally
commercially available), to any third party in respect of its ownership, use
or license of any Arbortext Intellectual Property. There has been no breach
or violation by Arbortext or any Subsidiary of, and to the Knowledge of
Arbortext, there is no breach or violation by any other party to, any
Arbortext License.  (d) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Arbortext and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not impair the rights of PTC or the Surviving Corporation to use, practice,
operate under, license, sublicense, dispose of, or bring suit for
infringement of any of the Arbortext Intellectual Property to the same extent
that Arbortext and each Subsidiary would have been able to had the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred and without the
payment of any additional amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees,
royalties or payments that Arbortext or any Subsidiary would otherwise be
required to pay.  (e) Neither the business of Arbortext or any Subsidiary,
as currently conducted, nor the services, products or support delivered by
Arbortext or any Subsidiary to its customers, nor, to the Knowledge of
Arbortext, Arbortext\'s or any Subsidiary\'s use of third party products or
services, infringe, constitute the misappropriation of, or conflict with, any
Proprietary Rights of any third party (including without limitation due to
the use of any third party software without a valid license or without
complying with the restrictions and terms of a valid license). Arbortext has
no Knowledge of any claim, and neither Arbortext nor any Subsidiary has ever
received any written (or, to the Knowledge of Arbortext, oral) notice or
other communication of any claim from, any person asserting that the business
of Arbortext or any Subsidiary, as currently conducted and/or as contemplated
to be conducted, or any of the services, products or support delivered by
Arbortext or any Subsidiary to its customers, or any use by Arbortext or any
Subsidiary of any third party products or services, infringe or may infringe,
constitute the misappropriation of, or conflict with, any Proprietary Rights
of another person. Arbortext has no Knowledge of any existing or threatened
infringement, misappropriation, or competing claim by any third party
regarding the right to use or ownership of any Arbortext Intellectual
Property.  (f) Section 2.16(f) of the Arbortext Disclosure Schedule lists
any software (regardless whether in object or source code form or whether
only forming part of a software application or only part of a function or
procedure in a software application) that (i) has been incorporated or
embedded into, or distributed with, any Arbortext software products and (ii)
was not developed by employees of Arbortext or any Subsidiary in the course
of their employment for Arbortext or any Subsidiary. No consultants,
contractors, or other third parties (other than employees of Arbortext or any
Subsidiary in the course of their employment) have contributed to, or
participated in any respect in the development of, the Arbortext Intellectual
Property (excluding any Intellectual Property underlying third party
commercially available software, non-exclusively licensed to Arbortext for
its internal operations, and which is not embedded or incorporated in, or
used by Arbortext to support or design, its software products).  (g) Neither
Arbortext nor any Subsidiary is subject to any "open source" or "copyleft"
obligations or otherwise required to make any public disclosure or general
availability of source code either used, acquired for use or developed by
Arbortext or any Subsidiary. Neither Arbortext nor any Subsidiary uses
any software that contains, or is derived in any manner (in whole or in part)
from, any software that is distributed as free software, open source software
(e.g., Linux) or similar licensing or distribution models (collectively,
"Open Source Software"), including software licensed or distributed under any
of the following licenses or distribution models, or licenses or distribution
models similar to any of the following: (i) GNU\'s General Public License
(GPL) or Lesser/Library GPL (LGPL); (ii) the Artistic License (e.g., PERL);
(iii) the Mozilla Public License; (iv) the Netscape Public License; (v) the
Sun Community Source License (SCSL); or (vi) the Sun Industry Standards
License (SISL). Arbortext and its Subsidiaries (and their respective
consultants, affiliates, and agents) have not incorporated, bundled, or
distributed any Open Source Software into or with any of Arbortext\'s or its
Subsidiaries\' software products in such a manner as to cause or require,
under the terms of the applicable open source license agreement for such Open
Source Software, (A) all or any portion of such software product (other than
original Open Source Software) to be treated as Open Source Software under
the terms of such open source license or (B) the source code of such software
product (other than the original Open Source Software) to be distributed or
provided to licensees in connection with the licensing or distribution of
such software product. Neither Arbortext nor any Subsidiary has incorporated
in, or included with, any Arbortext software products, or otherwise delivered
to any customers, any software or any derivative of any software which both
(A) Arbortext or any of its Subsidiaries created and/or delivered to a
customer in the course of performing consulting, implementation, maintenance
or other services and (B) in which such customer has any ownership or other
rights other than a nonexclusive license from Arbortext or a Subsidiary
(regardless whether such rights were assigned to or vested in such
customer).  (h) To Arbortext\'s Knowledge, there are no defects in the
filing or prosecution of any of the patent applications and patents included
within the Arbortext Intellectual Property that could reasonably be expected
to cause either the invalidity of any such patent or any patent that may
issue from any such patent application, or cause a patent not to issue from
any such patent application. All patents or patent applications that are
filed or registered with any governmental body and included within the
Arbortext Intellectual Property are, to Arbortext\'s Knowledge, subsisting
and valid, and as to issued patents, neither Arbortext, nor anyone in privity
with Arbortext, has taken any action that would render such patents
unenforceable.  (i) Arbortext and its Subsidiaries have implemented policies
and procedures reasonably designed to establish and preserve the ownership of
the Arbortext Intellectual Property, including the protection of trade
secrets and other confidential information. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, all employees, consultants and independent contractors of
Arbortext or any Subsidiary who are or were involved in, or who have
contributed to, the creation or development of any Arbortext Intellectual
Property or have otherwise had access to confidential or proprietary
information of Arbortext or the applicable Subsidiary have executed and
delivered to Arbortext or any Subsidiary legally binding confidentiality and
assignment of inventions agreements in form and substance substantially
identical to the form of the Confidentiality and Inventions Agreement
included in Section 2.16(i) of the Arbortext Disclosure Schedule. Copies of
such agreements have been delivered to PTC, and all of such agreements are in
full force and effect. Neither Arbortext or any Subsidiary is aware of any
violation of the confidentiality of any trade secrets or proprietary
information comprising Arbortext Intellectual Property. Neither Arbortext or
any Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of Arbortext, the employees, consultants,
or independent contractors of Arbortext or any Subsidiary have any agreements
or arrangements with any former employers relating to
confidential information or trade secrets of such employers that would
interfere with the activities of Arbortext or any Subsidiary. To the
Knowledge of Arbortext, the activities of the employees, consultants, or
independent contractors of Arbortext or any Subsidiary on behalf of the
business of Arbortext or any Subsidiary as currently conducted and
contemplated to be conducted do not violate any agreements or arrangements
which such employees have with former employers or any other third person. To
Arbortext\'s Knowledge, no current or former employee, officer, director,
stockholder, consultant or independent contractor of Arbortext or any
Subsidiary has any right, claim or interest in or with respect to any of the
Arbortext Intellectual Property.  2.17 Title to Assets; Liens. Arbortext and
each Subsidiary owns outright and has good title to, or, in the case of
leased properties and assets, has valid leasehold interests in, all of its
assets and properties, including, without limitation, all of the assets and
properties reflected on the Interim Balance Sheet and all other assets and
properties that are reasonably necessary for the conduct of its business as
presently conducted, free and clear of any Lien, except for (a) assets and
properties disposed of, or subject to purchase or sales orders, in the
ordinary course of business since the date of the Interim Balance Sheet and
(b) liens or other encumbrances securing the claims of materialmen, carriers,
landlords and like persons, or for Taxes, all of which are not yet due and
payable ("Permitted Liens"). At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
will own all right, title and interest thereto, free and clear of Liens
except Permitted Liens.  2.18 Customers; Warranties.  (a) Section 2.18 of
the Arbortext Disclosure Schedule sets forth the thirty (30) customers who
accounted for the largest sales of Arbortext and its Subsidiaries for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 (the "Key Customers"). The relationships
between Arbortext and any Subsidiary and the Key Customers are generally good
commercial working relationships. Except at the request of Arbortext or any
Subsidiary, no Key Customer has cancelled or otherwise terminated its
relationship with Arbortext or such Subsidiary (including pursuant to the
expiration of any license or maintenance contract without renewal). Neither
Arbortext nor any Subsidiary has received notice, whether written or, to the
Knowledge of Arbortext, oral, that any Key Customer intends to terminate,
cancel or decrease materially or limit its usage of the products of Arbortext
or such Subsidiary. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, Arbortext
recognized at least 90% of the amount of revenue that would have
been recognizable in respect of software maintenance contracts coming due for
renewal in that year if all such contracts had then been renewed, and
Arbortext has no Knowledge of any facts, circumstances or events that would
cause such renewal rate to materially change from that in 2004.  (b) No
commercially released product manufactured, sold (whether directly
or indirectly, including through any reseller, channel partner or
distributor), licensed, leased, or delivered by Arbortext or any Subsidiary
is subject to any guaranty, warranty, or other indemnity other than (i)
standard terms and conditions of sale or license as set forth in Section
2.18(b) of the Arbortext Disclosure Schedule, (ii) in a Material Contract
listed in Section 2.13 of the Arbortext Disclosure Schedule, or (iii) the
exposure under which does not exceed $100,000 individually or in the
aggregate for any series of related transactions. All products manufactured,
sold (whether directly or indirectly, including through any reseller, channel
partner or distributor), licensed, leased and delivered by Arbortext or any
Subsidiary have been in conformity in all material respects with all
applicable contractual commitments and expressed and implied warranties, and
no liability for any warranty claims exists for the repair or replacement
thereof or otherwise. Arbortext and its Subsidiaries collectively did not
experience a Return Rate in excess of five percent (5%) of their consolidated
license revenue during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, and Arbortext
has no Knowledge of any facts, circumstances or events that would cause the
Return Rate for fiscal 2005 to change materially from that in 2004.  (c)
Neither Arbortext nor any Subsidiary has granted any pricing or other terms
to any customer with respect to any products or services that required
or will require any discount, pricing terms or other terms granted by
Arbortext or any Subsidiary to any other customer be made more favorable for
such other customer by reason of any Most Favored Customer Provision.  2.19
Employee Benefit Plans.  (a) Section 2.19 of the Arbortext Disclosure
Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of all Employee Benefit Plans
(as defined below) currently maintained or contributed to by Arbortext or any
ERISA Affiliate (as defined below), or pursuant to which Arbortext or any
Subsidiary has any Liability. For purposes of this Agreement, "Employee
Benefit Plan" means (i) any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA")), (ii) any "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA), and (iii) any other written or oral plan, program,
agreement or arrangement providing employee benefits or compensation,
including without limitation salary, wages, insurance coverage, severance
benefits, disability benefits, deferred compensation, bonuses, stock options,
stock purchase, phantom stock, stock appreciation or other forms of incentive
compensation or post-retirement or post-termination compensation, in each
case relating to any current or former director, officer,
employee, consultant, member, partner, independent contractor or agent of
Arbortext or any ERISA Affiliate that is currently maintained or contributed
to by Arbortext or any ERISA Affiliate or pursuant to which Arbortext or any
Subsidiary has any Liability. For purposes of this Agreement, "ERISA
Affiliate" means (i) any corporation included with Arbortext in a controlled
group of corporations within the meaning of Section 414(b) of the Code; (ii)
any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) that is under common
control with Arbortext within the meaning of Section 414(c) of the Code;
(iii) any member of an affiliated service group of which Arbortext is a
member within the meaning of Section 414(m) of the Code; or (iv) any other
person or entity treated as aggregated with Arbortext under Section 414(o) of
the Code.  (b) Arbortext has provided or otherwise made available to PTC
current, accurate and complete copies of (i) each Employee Benefit Plan that
has been reduced to writing and all amendments thereto, (ii) a summary of the
material terms of each Employee Benefit Plan that has not been reduced to
writing, including all amendments thereto, (iii) the summary plan description
for each Employee Benefit Plan subject to Title I of ERISA, and in the case
of each other Employee Benefit Plan, any similar employee summary (including
but not limited to any employee handbook description), (iv) for each Employee
Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, the
most recent determination letter or exemption determination issued by the
IRS, (v) for each Employee Benefit Plan with respect to which a Form 5500
series annual report/return is required to be filed, the most recently filed
such annual report/return and annual report/return for the two preceding
years, together with all schedules and exhibits, and (vi) all insurance
contracts, administrative services contracts, trust agreements, investment
management agreements or similar agreements maintained in connection with any
Employee Benefit Plan. No employee benefit handbook or similar employee
communication relating to any Employee Benefit Plan nor any written
communication of benefits under such Employee Benefit Plan describes the
Employee Benefit Plan in a manner materially inconsistent with the documents
and summary plan descriptions relating to such Employee Benefit Plan that
have been delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence.  (c) There is no
entity (other than Arbortext and its Subsidiaries) that together with
Arbortext would be treated as a single-employer within the meaning of Section

Employee Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code is so qualified. Each Employee Benefit Plan has been administered
in all material respects in accordance with the terms of such plan and the
provisions of any and all statutes, orders or governmental rules
or regulations, including without limitation ERISA and the Code, and nothing
has been done or not done with respect to any Plan that could result in
any liability on the part of Arbortext under Title I of ERISA or Chapter 43
of the Code; provided, however, that with respect to acts or omissions of
third parties, the foregoing representation shall be to the Knowledge of
Arbortext. All reports, forms and notices required to be filed with respect
to each Employee Benefit Plan, including without limitation Form 5500 series
annual reports/returns and PBGC Form 1s, have been timely filed. All
contributions, premiums and other amounts due to or in connection with each
Employee Benefit Plan under the terms of the Employee Benefit Plan or
applicable law have been timely made, and provision has been made in the
Interim Balance Sheet for such contributions, premiums and other amounts that
were due as of the Interim Balance Sheet Date but were attributable to
service before such date. Each employee stock option designated as an
incentive stock option (or ISO) on Attachment 2.2(b) to Section 2.2 of the
Arbortext Disclosure Schedule meets the requirements for treatment as an
incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code.  (e) No Employee
Benefit Plan is or has been subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code.  (f) All claims for welfare benefits incurred by participants and
beneficiaries on or before the Closing Date are or will be fully covered by
fully-funded or paid-up third-party insurance policies or programs, and no
insured arrangement involves any retrospective premium, minimum premium, or
similar arrangement with any of Arbortext\'s or any Subsidiary\'s insurers.
Except for continuation of health coverage to the extent required under
Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 et seq. of ERISA ("COBRA"), or
applicable state and foreign laws, there are no obligations under any
Employee Benefit Plan providing welfare benefits after termination of
employment.  (g) Except for individual employment agreements, each Employee
Benefit Plan can be amended, modified or terminated without advance notice to
or consent by any employee, former employee or beneficiary, and without
liability for any payment or penalty, except as required by law.  (h)

in Section 413(c) of the Code, or any plan that has two or more
contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063(a) of ERISA, (iii) welfare benefit fund
within the meaning of Section 419(e) of the Code, or (iv) voluntary
employees\' beneficiary association, within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code.  (i) No employee of, consultant to, or other provider of
services to Arbortext, or any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliates will be
entitled to any additional benefit or the acceleration of the payment or
vesting of any benefit under any Employee Benefit Plan by reason of the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  (j) None of Arbortext, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has
any "leased employees" within the meaning of Section 414(n) of the Code or
any independent contractors or other individuals who provide employee-type
services but who are not recognized by Arbortext or any Subsidiary as
employees of Arbortext or such Subsidiary.  (k) Neither Arbortext nor any
Subsidiary is a party to any contract or agreement, plan, or arrangement,
including, without limitation, the consummation of the transactions or other
events contemplated by this Agreement, concerning any person that,
individually or collectively with other similar agreements, and taking into
account any transactions or payments contemplated by this Agreement, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to the payment of any amount that would
not be deductible by Arbortext or such Subsidiary by reason of Section 280G
of the Code. Neither Arbortext nor any Subsidiary has any obligation to make
any reimbursement or other payment to any such person with respect to any Tax
imposed under Section 4999 of the Code. None of the Employee Benefit
Plans, in form or in operation, is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code.  (l) With
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan maintained for employees outside of the
United States (each a "Foreign Plan"): (i) each Foreign Plan covers
only employees of a single company who regularly perform services in a single
country and no other employees, (ii) each Foreign Plan and the manner in
which it has been administered satisfies all applicable laws, (iii) all
contributions to each Foreign Plan required through the Effective Date have
been and will be made by Arbortext or its Subsidiaries, (iv) each Foreign
Plan is either fully funded (or fully insured) based upon generally accepted
local actuarial and accounting practices and procedures or adequate accruals
for each Foreign Plan have been made in Arbortext\'s financial statements,
and (v) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not by itself create or otherwise result in any liability with respect
to any Foreign Plan.  2.20 Employment Matters.  (a) Section 2.20 of the
Arbortext Disclosure Schedule lists the name, title and date of hire of (i)

Tax Returns or Tax Statement. The Stockholder Representative shall provide
PTC with a written description of proposed changes to such Tax Returns or Tax
Statements and a description of the items in the Tax Returns or the Tax
Statements that he intends to dispute within ten (10) days following the
delivery to him of such documents. In the event that the Stockholder
Representative does not provide such written description within the ten (10)
day period specified in the preceding sentence, he shall be deemed to have
accepted and agreed to such Tax Returns or Tax Statements in the
form provided. PTC and the Stockholder Representative agree to consult with
each other and to resolve in good faith any timely-raised issue arising as a
result of the review of such Tax Returns or the Tax Statement to permit the
filing of such Tax Returns as promptly as possible. In the event the parties
are unable to resolve any dispute within ten (10) days following the delivery
of written notice to PTC by the Stockholder Representative of disputed items,
the Stockholder Representative and PTC shall jointly request an
Independent Accountant to resolve any issue in dispute no later than five
business days prior to the due date of such Tax Return, in order that such
Tax Return may be timely filed. If the Independent Accountant is unable to
make a determination with respect to any disputed issue within five (5)
business days before the due date (including extensions) for the filing of
the Tax Return in question, then PTC and the Surviving Corporation may file
such Tax Return on the due date (including extensions) therefor without such
determination having been made and without the consent of the Stockholder
Representative; provided, however, that such Tax Return shall incorporate
such changes as have at the time of such filing been agreed to by the parties
pursuant to this Section 4.6(a). Notwithstanding the filing of such Tax
Return, the Independent Accountant shall make a final determination with
respect to any disputed issue, and the amount of Taxes that are allocated to
the Securityholders pursuant to this Section 4.6 shall be as determined by
the Independent Accountant. The filing of such Tax Return prior to the final
determination of any disputed item and the position taken on such Tax Return
with respect to any disputed item shall not be a factor in the determination
by the Independent Accountant of the amount of Taxes that are allocated to
the Securityholders pursuant to this Section 4.6. The Stockholder
Representative and PTC shall each bear one-half of the
Independent Accountant\'s fees and expenses, and the determination of the
Independent Accountant shall be binding on all parties.  (b) The
Securityholders shall reimburse PTC and the Surviving Corporation
in accordance with Section 8.2 for all Taxes of Arbortext with respect to (i)
the Pre-Closing Periods and (ii) the portion of the Straddle Periods ending
on the Effective Date, except to the extent such Taxes were included as
Other Liabilities in the calculation of the Closing Adjustment under
Section 1.7(c)(ii), in each case within fifteen (15) days after payment by
PTC, the Surviving Corporation, or Arbortext of such Taxes. For purposes of
this section, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis
and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax that relates
to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Effective Date shall (i)
in the case of the Taxes other than Taxes based on or related to income or
receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the taxable period ending on the Effective Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire taxable period; and (ii) in the
case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be deemed equal
to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on
the Effective Date. Any Tax credits relating to a Straddle Period shall be
taken into account as though the relevant taxable period ended at the
Effective Date.  (c) Nothing in this Section 4.6 shall excuse the
Securityholders from their responsibility for their share, as determined in
accordance with this Section 4.6, of any such Taxes if the amount of Taxes as
ultimately determined (on audit or otherwise) for the periods covered by such
Tax Returns exceeds the amount determined under this Section 4.6.  (d) Each
of PTC, the Surviving Corporation, the Stockholder Representative, and the
Securityholders shall cooperate fully and in good faith, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any other party to this Agreement, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section and any audit, litigation,
or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of Arbortext. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other party\'s request)
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to
the preparation of any such Tax Return or to any such audit, litigation, or
other proceeding. Each Securityholder and the Stockholder Representative
shall (i) retain all books and records in his, her or its possession with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to Arbortext relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Effective Date until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by PTC or the Surviving
Corporation, any extension thereof) of the applicable taxable periods, and
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority, and (ii) give to PTC and the Surviving Corporation reasonable
written notice before transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
and records and, if PTC or the Surviving Corporation so requests, the
Stockholder Representative or such Securityholder shall allow PTC or the
Surviving Corporation to take possession of such books and records.  (e)
All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, and other
such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by the Securityholders when
due, and the Securityholders will, at no expense to PTC or the Surviving
Corporation, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration,
and other Taxes and fees, and, if, required by applicable law, PTC and the
Surviving Corporation will, and will cause their affiliates to, join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.  (f) To the
extent permitted under applicable law, the parties hereto agree to treat the
payment of consideration with respect to Options pursuant to
Sections 1.8(b)(i) (to which the provisions of Section 1.9(d) do not apply)
and 1.8(b)(ii) of this Agreement as being allocable to the portion of the
Effective Date after the Effective Time and, accordingly, that any federal
income tax deduction related to such payment shall be reflected on the
Arbortext\'s federal income Tax Return for the taxable period beginning on
the day after the Effective Date (and in a consistent manner on any
applicable state or local income Tax Returns).  4.7 Continuing Obligation
to Inform. From time to time before the Closing, Arbortext will deliver or
cause to be delivered to PTC all information coming to Arbortext\'s
attention, or concerning events occurring, after the date hereof that would
render any statement, representation or warranty in this Agreement or any
information contained in the Arbortext Disclosure Schedule inaccurate
or incomplete in any material respect if made as of such later date; provided
that none of such supplemental information shall constitute an amendment of
any statement, representation or warranty in this Agreement or any Schedule,
Exhibit or document furnished pursuant hereto.  4.8 Exclusivity. Neither
Arbortext nor any of its directors, Stockholders, officers, employees, agents
or affiliates (collectively, "Related Parties") shall, directly or
indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate, encourage or otherwise facilitate offers
or proposals from, or engage in or continue any discussions or negotiations
with, any other party (other than PTC) for (i) the sale or other disposition
of all or any portion of the equity interests or (outside the ordinary course
of business) the assets of Arbortext or any Subsidiary or the merger,
consolidation or other combination of Arbortext, any Subsidiary or
their respective businesses or assets with any other person or entity or (ii)
the issuance to any person (other than pursuant to Section 4.1(b)(iv)) of
shares or Purchase Rights that give or would give the holder thereof the
direct or indirect beneficial ownership of any issued and outstanding
Arbortext Stock, or (b) provide or offer to provide any information to any
other party or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate
in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other person to do
or seek any of the foregoing. Arbortext agrees to notify PTC promptly of any
such proposal or offer, or any inquiry or contact with respect thereto
received by Arbortext or any Related Party. In the event Arbortext or any of
the Related Parties takes or omits any action in contravention of this
Section 4.8, Arbortext shall, within ten (10) Business days after written
demand therefor by PTC, pay to PTC as liquidated damages and as reimbursement
for the expenses and losses incurred and estimated to be incurred by PTC in
connection with this Agreement the amount of $5,000,000 in cash or by
certified or bank cashier\'s check or wire transfer.  4.9 Transaction
Expenses. PTC and Arbortext shall each bear their own costs incurred in
connection herewith; provided that, if the Merger is
consummated, Arbortext\'s Transaction Expenses shall not exceed $500,000 in
the aggregate (all of which shall have been charged at customary rates and
supported by detailed invoices). The foregoing shall not limit the right of
the Securityholders to pay for any Transaction Expenses in excess of $500,000
("Excess Transaction Expenses"), and the Stockholder Representative, on
behalf of the Securityholders, shall promptly pay and discharge all such
Excess Transaction Expenses not included within the Closing Adjustments as
they come due. PTC shall be entitled to treat any Excess Transaction Expenses
not paid by the Stockholder Representative as Losses recoverable under
Section 8.  4.10 Public Announcements and Confidentiality.  (a) Any press
release or public announcement before the Closing by Arbortext or any of its
Related Parties with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall require the prior approval of PTC,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that a
party shall not be prevented from making such disclosure as it shall have
been advised by counsel is required by law.  (b) The terms of this
Agreement and all information furnished to either party or any of its Related
Parties by the other party or any of its Related Parties, and all analyses,
compilations, data, studies or other documents prepared by or for either
party containing or based in whole or in part on any such
furnished information or reflecting its review of, or interest in, the
transaction shall continue to be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement dated February 16, 2005 between PTC and Arbortext (the
"MNDA").  4.11 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.  (a) All rights
to indemnification by Arbortext existing at the Effective Time in favor of
each person who is now or has been prior to the date hereof or who becomes
prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of Arbortext or
any Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Persons") shall survive the Merger, and PTC
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue such rights in full force
and effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time and to perform, in a
timely manner, its obligations with respect thereto. Nothing contained herein
shall make PTC, Merger Sub, Arbortext or the Surviving Corporation an
insurer, a co-insurer or an excess insurer in respect of any insurance
policies which may provide coverage for Liabilities subject to such
indemnification, nor shall this Section 4.11 relieve the obligations of any
insurer in respect thereto. Each Indemnified Person is intended to be a third
party beneficiary of this Section 4.11. This Section 4.11 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of PTC and the Surviving Corporation.  (b) Arbortext
shall, before the Closing Date, purchase tail liability insurance covering
those persons who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, are covered
by Arbortext\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy for a
period of three (3) years after the expiration date of such policy on terms
substantially the same as those of Arbortext\'s present directors\'
and officers\' liability insurance policy; provided, however, that in no
event will Arbortext be required to pay in excess of 300% of the annual
premium most recently paid by Arbortext for such coverage; provided further,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event such coverage is not
available (or is only available for an amount in excess of 300% of the annual
premium most recently paid by Arbortext for such coverage), Arbortext shall
nevertheless use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such coverage
as may be obtained for such 300% amount.  4.12 Employee Benefits.  (a) As
of the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in any written employment
agreement with Arbortext or its Subsidiaries, PTC shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, to (i) initially maintain the
Employee Benefit Plans (other than equity-based benefits) maintained
by Arbortext or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
with respect to employees of Arbortext or its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time who continue employment with the Surviving Corporation
or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation ("Continuing Employees"), and
(ii) within one year following the Effective Time, provide such Continuing
Employees with the employee benefits provided by PTC to similarly situated
employees of PTC under PTC\'s employee benefits plans. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Continuing Employee to
employment with PTC, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. Subject to any written agreement between a Continuing Employee
and PTC, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
the employment of a Continuing Employee shall be terminable by the employer
"at will" with no further liability to the Continuing Employee other than as
expressly provided under the employer\'s employee benefit plans.  (b) With
respect to employee benefit plans, if any, of PTC, the Surviving Corporation,
or any of their respective Subsidiaries that provide group medical, dental,
or prescription drug coverage in which Continuing Employees become eligible
to participate after the Effective Time (the "PTC Group Health Plans"), PTC
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Subsidiaries to: (i) waive any exclusions for pre-existing
conditions under such PTC Group Health Plan that would result in a lack of
coverage for any condition for which the applicable Continuing Employee would
have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding Employee Benefit Plan
in which such Continuing Employee was an active participant immediately prior
to his or her transfer to the PTC Plan if such Continuing Employee can
provide proof of coverage under the corresponding plan of either Arbortext,
its Subsidiaries, or another employer\'s plan; (ii) waive any coverage
waiting period under such PTC Group Health Plan to the extent that such
period exceeds the corresponding waiting period under the corresponding
Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee was an active
participant immediately prior to his or her transfer to the PTC Group Health
Plan (after taking into account any prior service with Arbortext or
its Subsidiaries credited under such Employee Benefit Plan for purposes
of satisfying such waiting period); and (iii) provide each Continuing
Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid by such
Continuing Employee prior to his or her transfer to the PTC Group Health Plan
(to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Employee
Benefit Plan prior to such transfer) in satisfying any applicable deductible
or out-of-pocket requirements under such PTC Group Health Plan for the plan
year that includes such transfer; provided that, such Continuing Employee
shall be responsible for any applicable co-payments required to be made under
such PTC Group Health Plan. Covered Employees not currently covered by any
group health plan of Arbortext or its Subsidiaries may, subject to any
eligibility requirements, enroll in any PTC Group Health Plan extended to the
Continuing Employees during the next open enrollment period.  (c)
Continuing Employees shall receive credit for past service with Arbortext and
its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate in any
defined contribution retirement plans extended by PTC, the Surviving
Corporation, or their respective Subsidiaries to the Continuing Employees,
but the Continuing Employees shall not receive credit for any other purposes.
The terms and conditions of any such defined contribution retirement plan
shall be determined by PTC, the Surviving Corporation, or their respective
Subsidiaries.  (d) Continuing Employees shall receive credit for past
service with Arbortext and its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to
participate in any severance plan extended by PTC, the Surviving Corporation,
or their respective Subsidiaries to the Continuing Employees, but the
Continuing Employees shall not receive credit for any other purposes. The
terms and conditions of any such severance plan shall be determined by PTC,
the Surviving Corporation, or their respective Subsidiaries.  (e) Any
vacation days, sick days, or other paid time off that is accrued but unused
by current or former employees of Arbortext or its Subsidiaries (determined
immediately prior to the Effective Date) under the plans,
programs, arrangements, or policies of Arbortext or its Subsidiaries that,
under the terms thereof or applicable law, may be "banked," "rolled over" to
a subsequent plan year, or are otherwise deemed vested or that constitute a
binding obligation of the employer shall be paid out by Arbortext and its
Subsidiaries in cash (subject to applicable withholding) prior to the
Effective Time. The Continuing Employees will continue to accrue vacation
days or other paid time off under the plans, programs, arrangements, or
policies of Arbortext or its Subsidiaries until September 30, 2005. Accrued
but unused vacation days or other paid time off under the plans, programs,
arrangements, or policies of Arbortext or its Subsidiaries shall be subject
to amendment, suspension, termination, or forfeiture at December 31, 2005, as
determined by PTC. It is the intention of PTC to transition the Continuing
Employees to the paid time off policies applicable to PTC employees generally
after September 30, 2005, for which purpose the Continuing Employees shall
receive credit for past service with Arbortext and its Subsidiaries.  (f)
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.12, nothing in this Agreement
shall require PTC, the Surviving Corporation, or their
respective Subsidiaries to provide any particular type or level of
compensation or employee benefits, nor shall anything limit the right of PTC,
the Surviving Corporation, or their respective Subsidiaries to amend,
suspend, or terminate any employee benefit plan at any time.  4.13
Termination of Options. Arbortext\'s Board of Directors shall take
such actions and provide such notices as are required under the Arbortext
Option Plans to (a) require that no Options may be exercised after the fifth
(5th) business day after the date hereof and (b) cause all Options that will
be unvested and unexercisable at the Effective Time to terminate and cease to
be outstanding at the Effective Time, in accordance with Section 1.8(b)
hereof.  4.14 Delivery of Monthly Financial Statements. As promptly as
possible following the last day of each month after the date hereof until the
Closing Date, and in any event within fifteen (15) days after the end of each
such month, Arbortext shall deliver to PTC the consolidated balance sheet
of Arbortext and the Subsidiaries and the related statements of operations
and cash flows for the one-month period then ended, all certified by the
chief financial officer of Arbortext to the effect that such monthly
financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied with prior periods and fairly present the financial condition of
Arbortext and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and for the period
covered thereby.  4.15 Employee Benefit Plans. Arbortext shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) file all Forms 5500 Annual
Report/Return of Employee Benefit Plan (together, if applicable, with any
audited financial statements and schedules) ("Form 5500") required to be
filed with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan of Arbortext or any
Subsidiary as of the date immediately prior to the Effective Time, including
all Forms 5500 due for the plan year ended December 31, 2004 (determined
without regard to any filing extension), (b) pay all Taxes owed by Arbortext
or any Subsidiary as of the date immediately prior to the Effective Time as a
result of any failure to timely file any Form 5500 for any Employee Benefit
Plan of Arbortext or any Subsidiary, and pay any penalties, fees, interest,
or other amounts owed to the US Department of Labor, and (c) pay all accrued
vacation under Arbortext\'s former vacation policy as reflected in
the Financial Statements.  4.16 Subsidiary Employee Agreements. Arbortext
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Subsidiary to enter
into employment agreements with each of its respective employees
substantially in the form previously provided or made available to
PTC.  4.17 280G Approval.  (a) As promptly as practicable following the
date hereof, Arbortext shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a
binding agreement (a "280G Agreement") from any person who, if stockholder
approval meeting the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and
Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1 is not obtained before the Closing
Date, is reasonably expected to receive an Excess Parachute Payment in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The 280G
Agreement shall provide that such person agrees to forego and waive
without payment that portion of his or her compensation that, if not so
waived and cancelled, would result in such person receiving an Excess
Parachute Payment if such stockholder approval is not obtained. The
determination of the person or persons who shall be asked to execute a 280G
Agreement and the form of the 280G Agreement shall be subject to PTC\'s
approval, and no amendment or supplement to such documents shall be made by
Arbortext without PTC\'s approval.  (b) As promptly as practicable following
the date hereof, Arbortext shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain,
before the Closing Date, approval of its stockholders meeting the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and Treasury Regulations
Section 1.280G-1 of any payments that, absent such stockholder approval,
would result in the payment of an Excess Parachute Payment. The stockholder
consent form on which such stockholder approval shall be sought, and the form
of disclosure statement that will accompany such consent form, shall be
subject to PTC\'s approval, and no amendment or supplement to such documents
shall be made by Arbortext without PTC\'s approval.  (c) Arbortext shall, no
later than 14 days before the Closing Date, provide PTC with a copy of the
calculations showing the amount of any Excess Parachute Payment that would be
received in the absence of stockholder approval meeting the requirements of
Section 280G(b)(5) and applicable Treasury regulations, together with all
historical compensation information required to calculate the amount of any
Excess Parachute Payment.  SECTION 5  CONDITIONS TO EACH PARTY\'S

hereto (including the Arbortext Disclosure Schedule) or any certificate or
other instrument delivered by Arbortext or any Subsidiary pursuant to
Sections 1.7, 4.14, or 6 hereto;  (b) the incidence of any liability for (i)
any Tax of Arbortext or any Subsidiary with respect to any taxable period (or
portion thereof, determined in a manner consistent with Section 4.6(b)
hereof) ending on or before the Effective Date, except to the extent such Tax
is included as an Other Liability in the calculation of the Closing
Adjustment under Section 1.7(c)(ii), (ii) any Tax resulting from or
attributable to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) any Transfer Taxes, or (iv) the unpaid Taxes of any person
other than Arbortext or any Subsidiary under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Each claim for Losses
described in clause (a) of this Section 8.2 (to the extent that such claim
relates to the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.10
or the covenants set forth in Section 4.6, 4.1(a)(iii) or 4.1(b)(x)) or in
this clause (b) of this Section 8.2 is referred to herein as a "Tax Claim"
and collectively as the "Tax Claims;"  (c) any claim related to the matters
identified in Section 2.16(e)(1) of the Arbortext Disclosure Schedule;
and  (d) to the extent the stockholder vote described in Section 4.17 is
not obtained and there is a resulting Excess Parachute Payment; provided that
the respective Loss shall be the amount of such Excess Parachute Payment
multiplied by PTC\'s deemed effective tax rate of thirty-nine percent
(39%).  8.3 Notice and Opportunity to Defend.  (a) Notice of Claims.
Promptly after receipt by an PTC Indemnitee of notice of any complaint by a
third party or the commencement of any action or proceeding by a third party
(each, a "Third-Party Claim") that may result in a Loss with respect to which
such PTC Indemnitee may claim indemnification under this Section 8, the PTC
Indemnitee shall give written notice (a "Third-Party Demand") to the
Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Securityholders obligated
to provide indemnification under this Section 8 (each, an "Indemnifying
Party") and to the Escrow Agent. In the event any PTC Indemnitee seeks
indemnification pursuant to this Section 8 other than in connection with a
Third-Party Claim, such PTC Indemnitee shall send a written notice of the
respective Loss, or of any circumstance that with the lapse of time and/or
the occurrence of any other event or circumstance, may give rise to a Loss
(together with any Third-Party Demand, a "Demand") to the Stockholder
Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties and to the Escrow Agent.
Any Demand delivered pursuant to this Section 8.3(a) shall (i) describe the
basis for such Demand in reasonable detail and (ii) indicate the amount
(reasonably estimated, if appropriate) of the Loss that has been or may be
suffered by the PTC Indemnitee. No delay or failure to give any such notice
by any PTC Indemnitee shall relieve any Indemnifying Party from any
obligation hereunder or otherwise prejudice any claim capable of being made
against the Escrow Funds (provided that such Demand is made before the Claims
Termination Date), except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced thereby.  (b) Response to a Demand. The Stockholder
Representative may reply to a Demand by written notice given to the PTC
Indemnitee making such Demand and to the Escrow Agent, which notice shall
state whether the Stockholder Representative agrees or disagrees that such
PTC Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement for all or
any part of the claim asserted in such Demand and agrees or disagrees with
respect to the amount of indemnifiable Losses asserted in such Demand, and
which specifies the nature and the amount of any such dispute (a "Contest
Notice"). If, within twenty (20) days after receipt of the Demand (the
"Contest Notice Period"), the Stockholder Representative does not deliver a
Contest Notice in compliance with the foregoing or gives a notice to the PTC
Indemnitee making such Demand that the Demand is undisputed in whole or in
part, the Indemnifying Party(ies) shall thereupon pay to the PTC Indemnitee
making such Demand the amount of the undisputed portion of the
Losses asserted in such Demand (which amount shall be satisfied solely from
the Escrow Funds available under the Escrow Agreement), and the Escrow Agent
shall disburse such amount from the Escrow Funds to such PTC Indemnitee. Any
portion of any Demand that is disputed in a Contest Notice properly delivered
within the applicable Contest Notice Period shall be considered a "Disputed
Claim" and shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution
provisions of Section 8.3(c).  (c) Disputed Claims. The parties hereto
shall make a reasonable good faith effort to resolve their differences with
respect to any Disputed Claim for a period of twenty (20) days following the
receipt of any timely Contest Notice from the Stockholder Representative. Any
portion of such Disputed Claim that is resolved by the parties during such
period shall cease to be a Disputed Claim, and shall either be paid by the
Indemnifying Party(ies) out of the Escrow Funds as set forth in Section
8.3(b) hereof or shall be dismissed, in accordance with the resolution
reached by the parties. To the extent that, at the end of such twenty
(20)-day period, the parties have failed to reach a written agreement with
respect to any portion of the Disputed Claim, the provisions of
Section 10.4(b) shall apply.  (d) Defense of Third Party Claims.  (i) The
Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Party(ies), may
elect to compromise or defend, and control the defense of, any Third-
Party Claim at its own expense and by counsel who shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the PTC Indemnitee(s). If the Stockholder Representative
elects to compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim, he shall within twenty
(20) days after receipt of the respective Third-Party Demand (or sooner, if
the nature or procedural posture of the Third-Party Claim so requires) notify
the PTC Indemnitee(s) making such Demand of his intent to do so, and such PTC
Indemnitee(s) shall reasonably cooperate upon the request and at the expense
of the Stockholder Representative in the compromise of, or defense against,
such Third-Party Claim. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Stockholder
Representative may not agree to any compromise or settlement to which the PTC
Indemnitee(s) has not consented in writing, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld. If the Stockholder Representative elects not to
compromise or defend the Third-Party Claim, or fails to notify the PTC
Indemnitee(s) of its election as herein provided, or fails to diligently
defend or seek to compromise such Third-Party Claim after electing to assume
such defense or compromise, the PTC Indemnitee(s) may, in the exercise of its
reasonable discretion, pay, compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim. In
any event, (y) the PTC Indemnitee(s) may participate in (but shall not have
the right to control), at its own expense, the defense of any Third-Party
Claim by the Stockholder Representative and (z) the PTC Indemnitee(s) shall
have the right to retain or resume control of any Third-Party Claim if it
reasonably determines that the amount of any Loss related to such claim would
exceed the amount of the then-remaining Escrow Funds (reduced by the amount
of any outstanding Disputed Claims). In the event the Stockholder
Representative elects to defend and/or settle a Third-Party Claim arising
with respect to the matters described in Section 8.2(c), the costs of such
defense and settlement incurred by the Stockholder Representative, to
the extent related to such matters, shall be payable from the Escrow
Funds.  (ii) The Stockholder Representative shall use reasonable efforts to
keep the PTC Indemnitee(s) advised of the status of any Third Party Claim
that he has elected to control pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 8.3(d)
any Loss related to which would constitute a Tax Claim (including any Tax
audits, examinations, appeals, litigation, or other similar proceedings).
The Stockholder Representative shall furnish to the PTC Indemnitee(s) copies
of any inquiries or requests for information from any taxing authority
relating to such Tax Claim, and shall notify the PTC Indemnitee(s) in advance
of any other written communication (i.e., communications not relating to
inquiries or requests for information covered above) proposed to be submitted
by the Stockholder Representative to the taxing authority relating to such
Tax Claim. The PTC Indemnitee(s) shall notify the Stockholder Representative
in writing as to which inquiries or information requests, or which other
proposed written communications, it desires to monitor and, with respect to
such matters, the Stockholder Representative shall submit for the PTC
Indemnitee(s)\'s review the information proposed to be provided to a taxing
authority in response to such inquiries or requests, or in such other written
communications. The PTC Indemnitee(s) shall have the right to consult with
the Stockholder Representative regarding any such response. The Stockholder
Representative shall promptly furnish to the PTC Indemnitee(s) a copy of any
notice of proposed adjustment, revenue agent\'s report, or similar report or
notice of deficiency received with respect to any such Tax Claim.  (iii)
Any prepayment, bond, or other security required to be paid with respect to
any claim for which a Demand is made hereunder in order to commence
or continue any action to defend or compromise such claim shall be treated at
the time of payment as an undisputed Loss under this Section 8, subject to
immediate payment of indemnification therefor from the Escrow Funds;
provided, however, that any portion of such amount that is recovered upon a
successful defense or compromise of the underlying Asserted Liability shall
be returned to the Escrow Funds for distribution pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, subject to setoff by the PTC Indemnitee(s) against any other claim
that is or would be a Final Claim under the Escrow Agreement.  8.4
Limitations on Indemnification. The indemnification provided by Section 8.2
shall, except with respect to any claim against any party arising from
fraud or intentional misstatements, be subject to the following
limitations:  (a) No indemnification shall be payable pursuant to clause (i)
of Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(c) with respect to any Loss (other than a
Loss resulting from fraud or intentional misrepresentation) unless such Loss
shall exceed $20,000 (the "Minimum Claim Size") and then unless the total of
all Losses indemnifiable pursuant to clause (i) of Section 8.2(a) or Section
8.2(c) that exceed the Minimum Claim Size exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Basket
Amount"), whereupon indemnification will be payable for the entire amount of
such Losses that exceed the Minimum Claim Size, subject to the further
provisions of this Agreement. In determining whether a Loss exceeds the
Minimum Claim Size, (x) all costs, expenses, interest, penalties and other
amounts, including attorneys fees, in connection with the investigation,
defense and settlement may be included, and (y) all Losses that result from
the same or a substantially related breach, claim or liability shall be
aggregated and deemed to be a single Loss. In connection with any claim for
indemnification under this Agreement, the PTC Indemnitee shall provide the
Stockholder Representative with written notice of all claims included in the
Basket Amount.  (b) No indemnification shall be payable pursuant to Section
8.2 with respect to any claim not made before 5:00 p.m. Boston, Massachusetts
time on the Claims Termination Date.  (c) All indemnification claims made
by an PTC Indemnitee under Section 8.2 shall be satisfied solely from the
Escrow Funds held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.  SECTION 9 
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER  9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be
terminated at any time before the Effective Time as follows:  (a) by PTC or
Arbortext if, without fault of the terminating party, the Closing shall not
have occurred on or before October 4, 2005, which date may be extended by
mutual agreement of the parties (the "Closing Deadline");  (b) by Arbortext
upon written notice to PTC if PTC has materially breached any representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein and has not cured such breach within
ten (10) Business Days of receipt of written notice from Arbortext or by the
Closing Date, if earlier;  (c) by PTC upon written notice to Arbortext if
Arbortext has materially breached any representation, warranty or covenant
contained herein and has not cured such breach within ten (10) Business Days
of receipt of written notice from PTC or by the Closing Date, if
earlier;  (d) by either PTC or Arbortext if any court of competent
jurisdiction or governmental body shall have issued an order, decree or
ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger, and such order, decree or ruling shall have become
final and nonappealable; or  (e) at any time with the written consent of PTC
and Arbortext.  9.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Section 9.1, it shall forthwith be void and have no
effect, without liability or obligation as a result of such termination on
the part of any party, its directors, officers or stockholders, except that
the provisions of this Section 9.2, Section 4.9 relating to Transaction
Expenses, and Section 4.10 relating to publicity and confidentiality shall
survive termination. Nothing contained herein shall relieve any party from
liability for any breach of this Agreement occurring before such
termination.  9.3 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended only by
an instrument signed by each party hereto, and any provision hereof may be
waived only by an instrument signed by each party benefited by such
provision.  SECTION 10  MISCELLANEOUS  10.1 Notices. Any notice or other

Schedules and Exhibits hereto), the Escrow Agreement and any collateral
agreements executed in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, written or oral, with respect thereto other
than the MNDA, including without limitation the Memorandum of
Understanding.  10.3 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, exclusive of
its choice of law rules.  10.4 Dispute Resolution.  (a) Submission to
Jurisdiction. Subject to Section 10.4(b), each party hereby irrevocably
submits to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting
in Wilmington, Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and agrees that all
claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
any such court. Each party hereby waives any defense of inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond,
surety or other security that might be required of the other party with
respect thereto.  (b) Dispute Resolution Procedures. Except to the extent of
any resolution procedure provided for any Dispute under any other section of
this Agreement, any dispute, controversy or claim between any PTC Indemnitee,
on the one hand, and Arbortext, any Securityholder, or the Stockholder
Representative, on the other hand (a "Dispute"), with respect to any
provision of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall be resolved in
accordance with the procedures described in this Section 10.4(b). The parties
shall establish an internal hierarchy to facilitate resolution of any Dispute
as set forth below:  (i) The parties shall first attempt to resolve any
Dispute between themselves. If they are unable to do so within a reasonable
period not to exceed sixty (60) days, such Dispute shall be submitted to
mandatory and binding arbitration at the election of either PTC or the
Stockholder Representative. Except as otherwise provided in this Section
10.4(b), the arbitration shall be pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA Rules") then
pertaining and shall be governed by the United States Arbitration Act, 9
U.S.C. Sections 1-16. A panel of three (3) arbitrators (the "Arbitration
Panel") shall preside over any Dispute(s). The Arbitration Panel shall be
appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules. The Optional Rules for Emergency
Measures of Protection of the AAA shall apply if a party believes it needs
emergency relief before constitution of the Arbitration Panel. Any award(s)
of the Arbitration Panel shall include Findings of Fact and Conclusions of
Law and shall be a Reasoned Award, all as defined by the AAA Rules.
Any award(s) of the Arbitration Panel shall be subject to the
confidentiality provisions of this Agreement. The award(s) rendered by the
Arbitration Panel in accordance with this provision shall be final and
judgment may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law in any
court having jurisdiction.  (ii) The place of arbitration shall be at the
office of the American Arbitration Association in Wilmington, Delaware. The
parties expressly covenant and agree to be bound by the decision of the
Arbitration Panel and to accept any such decision as the final determination
of the matter in dispute. Any decision, award and/or judgment rendered by the
Arbitration Panel may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.
The expenses and fees of the Arbitration Panel shall be borne as set forth in
the award of the Arbitration Panel. Each party shall bear its own legal fees
and expenses and all other fees and expenses incurred by it in connection
with any Dispute.  (iii) The Arbitration Panel shall be bound to apply the
substantive law of the State of Delaware. Arbitration of a Dispute involving
the application of the terms of this Agreement shall be decided by the
Arbitration Panel in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement.  (iv) The parties stipulate that the provisions of this Section
10.4(b) shall be a complete defense to any action or proceeding instituted in
any federal, state or local court or before any administrative tribunal with
respect to any controversy or dispute arising out of this Agreement. The
procedures specified in this Section 10.4(b) shall be the sole and exclusive
procedures for the resolution of a Dispute; provided, however, that a party,
without prejudice to the above procedures, may seek a preliminary injunction
or other provisional judicial relief, if in its sole judgment such action is
necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status quo.  10.5
Specific Performance and Other Remedies. Each party hereby acknowledges that
the rights of each party to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby are special, unique and of extraordinary character and that, in the
event that either party violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant
or agreement made by it herein, the non-breaching party may be without an
adequate remedy at law. In the event that either party violates or fails or
refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by such party herein, the
non-breaching party may, subject to the terms hereof and in addition to any
remedy at law for damages or other relief, institute and prosecute an action
in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce specific performance of
such covenant or agreement or seek any other equitable relief. Such right to
specific performance shall be available notwithstanding any other remedy for
breach provided for in this Agreement, at law, or in equity, and if any such
alternative remedy is available, a party shall have the right to elect
between them.  10.6 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
legal representatives.  10.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, including by facsimile, each
of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. Each
counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof each signed by less than
all, but together signed by all of, the parties hereto.  10.8 Exhibits and
Schedules. The Exhibits and Schedules (including the Arbortext Disclosure
Schedule) are a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. All
references herein to Sections, subsections, clauses, Exhibits and Schedules
shall be deemed references to such parts of this Agreement, unless the
context shall otherwise require. The inclusion of information in
the Schedules hereto shall not be construed as an admission that such
information is material to Arbortext. In addition, matters reflected in the
Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement
to be reflected in such Schedules. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature.  10.9 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for
reference only, and shall not affect the interpretation of this
Agreement.  10.10 Severability. Nothing contained herein shall be construed
to require the commission of any act contrary to law. Should there be any
conflict between any provisions hereof and any present or future statute,
law, ordinance, regulation, or other pronouncement having the force of law,
the latter shall prevail, but the provision of this Agreement affected
thereby shall be curtailed and limited only to the extent necessary to bring
it within the requirements of the law, and the remaining provisions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.  10.11 Stockholder
Representative.  (a) In order to efficiently administer the provisions of
this Agreement, including the defense and/or settlement of any claims for
which the Securityholders may be required to indemnify any PTC Indemnitee
pursuant to Section 8 hereof, Promod Haque has been appointed to act as the
Stockholder Representative as more fully described in this Section 10.11. The
Stockholder Representative shall have the authority, functions, powers,
obligations and liabilities set out in this Agreement and the same shall
continue in effect following the Effective Time.  (b) Arbortext hereby
irrevocably appoints the Stockholder Representative as its agent and
attorney-in-fact, and authorizes the Stockholder Representative on its behalf
(and the adoption of this Agreement by the Stockholders shall constitute the
ratification of such appointment and authority on behalf of
the Securityholders), to: (i) take all action permitted in connection with
the implementation of those provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement that require or permit action by the Stockholder Representative,
(ii) take all action permitted in connection with the defense and/or
settlement of any and all claims for which the Securityholders may be
required to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 8 hereof (including
rejecting, contesting, settling and resolving any such claims) and any claims
that may be made against the Escrow Funds under the Escrow Agreement, (iii)
review and take action with respect to Tax Returns and the Tax Statement
pursuant to Section 4.6 hereof, (iv) give and receive all notices and service
of process required or permitted to be given or received by the
Securityholders or the Stockholder Representative under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, and (v) take any and all such additional action as is
contemplated to be taken by or on behalf of the Securityholders by the terms
of this Agreement or of the Escrow Agreement.  (c) The Stockholder
Representative shall have the power to designate his successor hereunder. In
the event that the Stockholder Representative resigns from such position or
is unable to continue in such position without having designated a successor,
Securityholders holding among them the rights to receive at least a majority
of the amount then remaining in the Escrow Funds to be distributed to the
Securityholders (the "Majority Holders") shall promptly appoint another
representative to fill such vacancy, and such substituted representative
shall be deemed to be the Stockholder Representative for all purposes of this
Agreement; provided that a resigning Stockholder Representative shall
continue to perform his duties and obligations until his successor
is appointed and has become a party to this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. In the absence of such appointment, the Stockholder Representative
or PTC may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
a successor Stockholder Representative, and the costs, expenses and
reasonable attorneys\' fees incurred in connection with such proceeding shall
be paid by the Securityholders. The Stockholder Representative may be removed
at any time upon the written consent of the Majority Holders with concurrent
written notice to PTC; provided however, that a successor Stockholder
Representative must be concurrently appointed and become a party to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.  (d) All decisions, actions,
agreements, and instructions by the Stockholder Representative, including any
consent, waiver, or agreement between the Stockholder Representative and any
PTC Indemnitee relating to the defense or settlement of any claim for which
the Securityholders may be required to provide indemnification pursuant to
Section 8 hereof, and all notices provided to and/or legal process served
upon the Stockholder Representative in accordance with this Agreement shall
be deemed to be provided to and/or served upon the Securityholders and shall
be conclusive and binding upon the Securityholders, and no Securityholder nor
anyone claiming through a Securityholder shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same nor, except in the case of
fraud or willful breach of this Agreement by the Stockholder Representative,
any cause of action against the Stockholder Representative therefor. By
virtue of their approval of this Agreement and the Merger, the Stockholders
hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify the
Stockholders Representative for, and hold him harmless against, any loss,
liability or expense incurred in good faith and without gross negligence or
bad faith on the part of the Stockholders Representative and arising out of
or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties
hereunder.  (e) The Stockholder Representative is authorized to act on
behalf of the Securityholders notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement
among the Securityholders. Any person may conclusively and absolutely rely,
without inquiry, upon any actions of the Stockholder Representative as the
acts of the Securityholders in all matters referred to in this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement. In taking any actions as Stockholder Representative,
the Stockholder Representative may rely conclusively, without any further
inquiry or investigation, upon any certification or confirmation, oral or
written, given by any person he reasonably believes to be authorized
thereunto.  (f) PTC and each other PTC Indemnitee shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the Stockholder
Representative as to all matters described herein, including in connection
with the defense or settlement of any claims for indemnification pursuant to
Section 8 hereof or any other actions required or permitted to be taken by
the Stockholder Representative hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement and
shall have no duty to inquire into the authority of any person reasonably
believed by them to be the Stockholder Representative, and no party hereunder
shall have any cause of action against PTC or any such other person for any
action taken by it in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of any such
person.  (g) The provisions of this Section 10.11 are independent and
severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be
enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Securityholder
may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Remedies available at law for any breach of the provisions of this Section
10.11 will be inadequate; therefore, PTC and each other PTC Indemnitee shall
be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the
necessity of proving damages or posting any bond if such person brings an
action or proceeding to enforce the provisions of this Section 10.11.  (h)
The Stockholder Representative may employ and obtain the advice of
legal counsel, accountants and other professional advisors and incur such
other reasonable expenses on behalf of the Securityholders in connection with
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement as the Stockholder Representative, in
his sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable in the performance of his
or her duties as the Stockholder Representative. The fees and expenses
incurred by the Stockholder Representative may be paid from the Stockholder
Representative Funds, but not from any part of the Escrow Funds.  (i) The
Stockholder Representative represents and warrants to PTC and Arbortext that
he has all requisite capacity and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform his obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, this Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Stockholder Representative and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by each other party
hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder
Representative, enforceable against the Stockholder Representative in
accordance with its terms.   [The rest of this page intentionally
