ARTICLE III  CONSIDERATION



Section 3.1. Purchase Price. As consideration for the sale to the Purchaser
Parent of the Purchased Assets, at the Closing, the Purchaser Parent shall (a)
pay to the Seller Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an
amount in cash equal to the Cash Purchase Price, less the Escrow Amount
(as defined below), and (b) issue to Seller Parent duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares representing the Stock Purchase
Price, free and clear of any Liens and deliver to Seller Parent share
certificates therefor. The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment
pursuant to Section 3.3 below. Following the Closing, Purchaser Parent shall,
at Seller Parents instruction and upon submission by Seller Parent of all
necessary documentation, facilitate the transfer of the shares representing
the Stock Purchase Price to Seller Parents shareholders.



Section 3.2. Escrow Amount. At the Closing, the Purchaser Parent shall deposit
$15,000,000 of the Cash Purchase Price (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") into an
Escrow Account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") for a period of nine (9) months
following the Closing Date, pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_  (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ ") as security for the indemnification obligations of Sellers
pursuant to Section 9.2(a). The Escrow Amount shall be distributed from the
Escrow Account pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement.



Section 3.3. Post Closing Adjustments to Purchase Price.



(a) _Net Asset Value Post-Closing Adjustment_.



(i) _Post-Closing Determination_. Within ten (10) days after the Closing
Date, Seller Parent shall deliver to Purchaser Parent true and correct copies
of all financial books and records of the Sellers necessary for Purchaser
Parent to prepare a balance sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date for
purposes of calculating the Net Asset Value as of the Closing Date (the " _Net
Asset Value at Closing_ "). Within forty (40) days after receipt of such
materials from the Seller Parent, the Purchaser Parent and its auditors shall
prepare a balance sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing
Balance Sheet_ ") consistent with the manner of computation of the Base Net
Asset Value and in conformance with GAAP for the purposes of determining the
Net Asset Value at Closing and any resulting adjustments to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(ii)  



 

11  (the " _Net Asset Value Post Closing Adjustment_ "); provided, that, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that, for purposes of determining the Net Asset
Value at Closing, the Parties shall disregard any increase in the accounts
receivable of the Sellers between January 31, 2005 and the Closing Date
resulting from a decrease in the amount of receivables sold by the Sellers
between January 31, 2005 and the Closing Date. The Purchaser Parent and its
auditors shall make available to the Seller Parent and its auditors all
records and work papers used in preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Net Asset Value Post Closing Adjustment. If the Seller Parent disagrees with
the computation of any of the Net Asset Value at Closing reflected on the
Closing Balance Sheet or the Net Asset Value Post Closing Adjustment, the
Seller Parent may, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Closing
Balance Sheet, deliver a notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ") to the Purchaser
Parent setting forth the Seller Parents calculation of such Net Asset Value
at Closing or such Net Asset Value Post Closing Adjustment. If the Seller
Parent does not deliver an Objection Notice within such fifteen (15) day
period, then the Net Asset Value at Closing and Net Asset Value Post Closing
Adjustment shall be deemed finally determined to be as set forth on the
Closing Balance Sheet. If the Seller Parent does deliver an Objection Notice,
the Purchaser Parent and the Seller Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to resolve any disagreements as to the computation of the Net Asset Value at
Closing or Net Asset Value Post Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, but
if they do not obtain a final resolution within thirty (30) days after the
Purchaser Parent has received the Objection Notice, the Purchaser Parent and
the Seller Parent shall jointly retain an independent accounting firm of
recognized standing (the " _Firm_ ") to resolve any remaining disagreements.
In any event, a Net Asset Value Post Closing Adjustment shall be made with
respect to such amounts as are not in dispute, as set forth in the Objection
Notice. If the Purchaser Parent and the Seller Parent are unable to agree on
the choice of the Firm, then the Purchaser Parents auditors and the Seller
Parents auditors shall jointly select a "big-four" accounting firm (or a
successor) as the Firm. The Purchaser Parent and the Seller Parent shall
direct the Firm to render a determination within thirty (30) days after its
retention and the Purchaser Parent, the Seller Parent, and their respective
agents shall cooperate with the Firm during its engagement. The Firm shall
consider only those items and amounts set forth in the Objection Notice which
the Purchaser Parent and the Seller Parent are unable to resolve. The
Purchaser Parent and the Seller Parent shall each make written submissions to
the Firm promptly (and in any event within twenty (20) days after the Firms
retention), which submissions shall contain such Partys computation of the
Net Asset Value at Closing and Net Asset Value Post Closing Adjustment and
information, arguments, and support for such Partys position. The Firm shall
review such submissions and base its determination solely on them. In
resolving any disputed item, the Firm may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Firms
determination shall be based on the definition of the Net Asset Value,
included herein. The determination of the Firm shall be conclusive and
binding upon the Parties. The Purchaser Parent and the Seller Parent shall
each bear 50% of the costs and expenses of the Firm.



(ii) _Net Asset Value Post-Closing Adjustment_. If the Net Asset Value at
Closing is less than or greater than the Base Net Asset Value by more than
$1,000,000, then the Purchaser Parent shall reduce or increase the purchase
price payable to the Seller Parent for the Purchased Assets by an amount equal
to: (i) if the Net Asset Value at Closing is less than the Base Net Asset
Value by more than $1,000,000, the difference (the " _Purchaser Adjustment
Amount_ ") between (A) the difference between the Base Net Asset Value and the
Net Asset Value at Closing and (B) $1,000,000 or (ii) if the Net Asset Value
at Closing is greater than the Base Net Asset Value by more than $1,000,000,
the difference (the " _Seller Adjustment Amount_ ") between (A) the difference
between the Net Asset Value at Closing and the Base Net Asset Value and (B)
$1,000,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in
no event shall the Seller  



 

12  Adjustment Amount exceed $3,000,000; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if,
after the date of this Agreement, any Seller desires to enter into
a transaction with a customer that it believes will result in an increase in
such Sellers accounts receivable or such Sellers inventory and, to the
extent that Seller Parent desires an increase in the Seller Adjustment Amount
greater than what is specified in this Section 3.3(a)(ii), then Seller Parent
may request Purchaser Parent to reevaluate the limit of the Seller Adjustment
Amount. In connection therewith, Seller Parent shall provide Purchaser Parent
all information reasonably necessary for Purchaser Parent to evaluate Seller
Parents proposal and Seller Parent and Purchaser Parent shall mutually agree
upon any adjustment to the Seller Adjustment Amount, if any. Any Purchaser
Adjustment Amount will be paid to Purchaser Parent by Seller Parent within
three (3) days following the determination of the Net Asset Value at Closing
by delivery of a check to Purchaser Parent in the amount of the Purchaser
Adjustment Amount. Any Seller Adjustment Amount will be paid to Seller Parent
by Purchaser Parent within three (3) days following the determination of the
Net Asset Value at Closing by delivery of a check to Seller Parent in an
amount equal to the lesser of (a) the amount of the Seller Adjustment
Amount and (b) $3,000,000 (or such higher amount as Seller Parent and
Purchaser Parent may mutually agree as provided above).



(b) _Additional Post-Closing Adjustment_. The Sellers covenant and agree that,
as of the Closing Date, REMEC UK Ltd, shall not have any current or future
liabilities or obligations under the agreements set forth on Schedule 3.3(b).
Within five (5) days after the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall deliver to
Purchaser Parent a statement setting forth the status of such agreements and a
summary of all current and future obligations and liabilities under such
agreements as of the Closing Date. In the event that it is mutually determined
by Purchaser Parent and Seller Parent that, as of the Closing Date, REMEC UK
Ltd does have current or future liabilities or obligations under either such
agreement, then the Purchaser Parent may propose a reduction of the purchase
price payable to the Seller Parent for the Purchased Assets by an amount equal
to the aggregate dollar amount of such liabilities and obligations as
mutually determined by Purchaser Parent and Seller Parent. Any reduction in
the purchase price pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) will be paid to Purchaser
Parent by Seller Parent within three (3) days following the mutual
determination by Purchaser Parent and Seller Parent of the aggregate dollar
amount of such liabilities and obligations by delivery of a check to Purchaser
Parent in the amount of such liabilities and obligations.



Section 3.4. Allocation of Purchase Price. Purchaser Parent shall prepare an
allocation of the Purchase Price (and all other capitalized costs) among the
Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (and any similar provisions of state, local or
foreign law, as appropriate), which allocation shall be subject to the
approval of the Sellers in the exercise of their reasonable judgment.
Purchaser Parent shall deliver such allocation to Seller Parent within ninety
(90) days after the Closing Date. Purchasers, Sellers and their Affiliates
shall report, act and file Tax Returns (including, but not limited to Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent
with such allocation prepared by Purchaser Parent and approved by Seller. The
Sellers shall timely and properly prepare, execute, file and deliver all such
documents, forms and other information as Purchaser Parent may reasonably
request to prepare such allocation. Neither the Purchasers nor the Sellers
shall take any position (whether in audits, tax returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with such allocation unless required to do so by Applicable Law.



Section 3.5. Assumed Obligations. Purchasers hereby agree to assume only, and
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers from and against: (a) those
liabilities and obligations specifically set forth in _Schedule 3.5_ hereto;
(b) all warranty claims of third parties against Sellers  



 

13  with respect to any of the Purchased Assets or relating to the Business, as

third parties against Sellers with respect to any of the Purchased Assets or

of the Business or the ownership or use of the Purchased Assets on or after
the Closing Date; (h) all liabilities and obligations to employees of the
Sellers who become employees of or consultants to the Purchasers following
the Closing relating to obligations for vacation or holiday pay (accrued prior
to Closing) and any severance obligations under an existing written agreement
with such employee, all as set forth in _Schedule 3.5_ ; and (i) all
severance obligations to any employees of the Sellers who make a claim to the
Sellers that they are entitled to receive severance pursuant to Sellers
current __ severance policy __ (a copy of which is attached as part of 
_Schedule 3._ 5 for reference purposes) because they accepted an offer of
employment made by the Purchasers where the wages and benefits offered to such
employees by the Purchasers are not substantially equivalent to the wages and
benefits they received as employees of the Sellers, provided that Purchaser
Parent shall control the defense of and response to any such claim
(collectively, the " _Assumed Obligations_ "). Those liabilities and
obligations under the Assigned Contracts shall be assumed by Purchaser only
upon effective assignment of such Assigned Contract. The Assumed Obligations
shall not include any obligations or liabilities arising out of any default of
the Sellers occurring prior to Closing under any Assigned Contract,
regardless of when such liability or obligation is asserted.



Section 3.6. Liabilities Not Being Assumed. Except for the Assumed
Obligations, the Sellers agree that the Purchasers shall not be obligated to
assume or perform and are not assuming or performing any liabilities or
obligations of the Sellers, whether known or unknown, fixed or contingent,
certain or uncertain (the " _Retained Liabilities_ "), and the Sellers shall
remain responsible for and shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchasers from and against all Retained Liabilities, which shall
include, but not be limited to, the following obligations or liabilities of
the Sellers:



(a) Any compensation or benefits payable to present or past employees of the
Sellers incurred prior to the Closing Date, including without limitation,
any liabilities arising under any employee pension or profit sharing plan or
other employee benefit plan and any of any Sellers obligations for vacation,
holiday or sick pay, other than (i) the Sellers obligations for vacation or
holiday pay (accrued prior to Closing) and any severance obligations under
existing written agreements to those employees of the Sellers who become
employees of or consultants to the Purchasers following the Closing, as set
forth in _Schedule 3.5_ and (ii) the severance obligations described in
subsection (i) to Section 3.5 above;



(b) All federal, state, local, foreign or other Taxes related to the operation
of the Business or the ownership or use of the Purchased Assets prior to the
Closing Date and any Tax liability of the Sellers which is not related to the
Business;



(c) Any Liens, except for Permitted Liens, on any of the Purchased Assets and
all obligations and liabilities secured thereby that are not set forth on

not set forth on _Schedule 3.5_ hereto;

_Schedule 3.5_ hereto;

or use of the Purchased Assets prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) any other
business or non-business activities of the Sellers not related to the Business

legal actions or other proceedings set forth in _Schedule 3.6(f)_ ; and



(g) Any obligations under any employment, consulting or non-competition
agreement, whether written or oral incurred prior to the Closing Date and that

out of the termination by the Sellers of any of its employees in anticipation
or as a consequence of, or following, consummation of the Transactions.



Section 3.7. Tax Withholding. Purchasers or any agent of the Purchasers shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the purchase price paid to Sellers or
other payment otherwise payable by it pursuant to this Agreement, the amounts
required to be deducted and withheld under the Code, or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to the making of such
payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid by the
Purchasers.

of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (x) the Seller Parent shall provide
Purchaser Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
drafts of the Proxy Statement and related correspondence and filings, (y) the
Seller Parent shall include in such drafts, correspondence and filings all
comments reasonably proposed by Purchaser Parent and (z) to the extent

is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or any other filing made
pursuant to this Section 5.5(a), Seller Parent or Purchaser Parent, as the
case may be, shall promptly notify the other of such occurrence and cooperate
in filing with the SEC or its staff and/or mailing to shareholders of Seller
Parent such amendment or supplement. Each of Seller Parent and Purchaser
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent
accountants to deliver to Purchaser Parent a consent, dated the date on which
the Registration Statement shall become effective, in form customary in scope
and substance for consents delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements on Form S-4 under the Securities Act.



ARTICLE VI  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS



As a material inducement to Purchasers to enter into this Agreement, Seller

(a) Seller Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of California. Seller Subsidiary and
each Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization. Each Seller and each Subsidiary is duly qualified and in good  



 

22  standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the properties
owned, leased or operated, or the business conducted, by it require
such qualification, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good
standing individually or in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. _Schedule 6.1_ contains a complete and accurate list
of each of the Sellers and the Subsidiaries and their respective
jurisdictions of incorporation or organization.



(b) Each Seller and each Subsidiary has full organizational power and
authority to conduct its business as it is now being conducted, to own or use
the properties and assets that it purports to own or use, and to perform all
its obligations under the contracts to which it is party.



(c) The Seller Parent has made available to the Purchaser Parent correct and
complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation and bylaws (or
equivalent governing documents) for each Seller and each Subsidiary, which
documents reflect all amendments made thereto at any time before the date
hereof. Copies of the minute books containing the records of meetings of the
shareholders and the board of directors (or equivalent parties) of the
Sellers and each Subsidiary which relate to the Business have been made
available to the Purchaser Parent. No Seller or Subsidiary is in default under
or in violation of any provision of its Articles of Incorporation or bylaws
(or equivalent governing documents). All corporate decisions of the board of
directors and the shareholders in general meetings of each Seller and
Subsidiary have been made in accordance with such Seller or
Subsidiaries governing documents and Applicable Law in force at the time
such decisions were made.



Section 6.2. Authorization of Transactions. The Sellers have all requisite
power and authority to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents to which
any is a party and to consummate the Transactions. The board of directors of

Transaction Documents, the performance of the Sellers obligations thereunder
and the consummation of the Transactions and (c) resolved to recommend that
the stockholders of the Seller Parent adopt and approve this Agreement (the "
_Seller Board Recommendation_ "). The affirmative vote (in person or by
proxy) of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Seller Parent
common stock at the Seller Parent Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof in favor of the adoption of this Agreement (the "
_Seller Stockholder Approval_ ") is the only vote or approval of the holders
of any class or series of capital stock of the Sellers which is necessary to
adopt this Agreement and approve the Transactions. No other proceedings on
the part of the Sellers are necessary to approve and authorize the execution
and delivery of the Transaction Documents, the performance of the Sellers
obligations thereunder and the consummation of the Transactions. All
Transaction Documents to which the Sellers are a party have been duly
executed and delivered by the Sellers, as applicable, and, with respect to
Transaction Documents executed subsequent to the date hereof, will be duly
executed and delivered by the Sellers as of such date, and such Transaction
Documents do or shall, as of the Closing Date, constitute the valid, legal and
binding agreements of the respective Sellers enforceable against each such
Seller in accordance with their terms, except as limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
of general application affecting enforcement of creditors rights; and as
limited by general principles of equity that restrict the availability of
equitable remedies.

 



Section 6.3. Absence of Conflicts. Except as set forth in  _Schedule 6.3_ ,
neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the

conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the Articles
of Incorporation or bylaws (or similar governing documents) of any Seller or
Subsidiary;  



 

23  (b) result in a violation or breach of or constitute (with or without due
notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right
of termination, amendment, cancellation, payment, acceleration or Lien) under
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other instrument
or obligation to which any Seller or Subsidiary is a party or by which any
Seller or Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets are
bound; or (c) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, law, statute, rule
or regulation applicable to any Seller or Subsidiary or any of their

reference in the Registration Statement as it relates to Sellers, at the time
the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, shall not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to shareholders, at the time of the
Seller Parent Stockholders Meeting, and at the Closing shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

Purchasers of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this
Agreement.

make each statement contained herein or therein, not misleading.



 

37 ARTICLE VII  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASERS



As a material inducement to the Seller Parent to enter into this
Agreement, the Purchasers, jointly and not severally, hereby represent and
warrant to the Sellers that:



Section 7.1. Organization and Corporate Power.



(a) Purchaser Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of Delaware. Each Purchaser Subsidiary is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. Each
Purchaser is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction where the properties owned, leased or operated, or the
business conducted, by it require such qualification, except where the
failure to so qualify or be in good standing individually or in the aggregate
is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.



(b) Each Purchaser has full organizational power and authority to conduct
its business as it is now being conducted, to own or use the properties and
assets that it purports to own or use, and to perform all its obligations
under the contracts to which it is party.



(c) The Purchaser Parent has made available to the Seller Parent correct and
complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent
governing documents) for each Purchaser, which documents reflect all
amendments made thereto at any time before the date hereof. No Purchaser is in
default under or in violation of any provision of its Articles of
Incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent governing documents). All corporate
decisions of the board of directors and the shareholders in general meetings
of each Purchaser have been made in accordance with such Purchasers
governing documents and Applicable Law in force at the time such decisions
were made.



Section 7.2. Authorization of Transactions. The Purchasers have all requisite
power and authority to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents to which
any is a party and to consummate the Transactions. The board of directors of
the Purchaser Parent has duly approved the Transaction Documents and has duly
authorized the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents the
performance of the Purchasers obligations thereunder and the consummation of
the Transactions. No other proceedings on the part of the Purchasers are
necessary to approve and authorize the execution and delivery of the
Transaction Documents the performance of the Purchasers
obligations thereunder and the consummation of the Transactions. All
Transaction Documents to which the Purchasers are a party have been duly
executed and delivered by the Purchaser Parent or Purchaser Subsidiary, as the
case may be, and constitute the valid, legal and binding agreements of the
Purchaser Parent or Purchaser Subsidiary, as the case may be, enforceable
against the Purchaser Parent or Purchaser Subsidiary in accordance with their
terms, except as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other laws of general application affecting
enforcement of creditors rights; and as limited by general principles of
equity that restrict the availability of equitable remedies.



Section 7.3. Absence of Conflicts. Neither the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by the Purchasers nor the consummation by
the Purchasers of the Transactions will: (i) conflict with or result in any
breach of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws (or
similar governing documents) of any Purchaser; (ii) result in a violation or
breach of or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both)
a default (or give rise to any right of termination,  



 

38  amendment, cancellation, payment, acceleration or Lien) under any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any material note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which any Purchaser is a party or by which any Purchaser or any
of their respective properties or assets are bound; or (iii) violate any
order, writ, injunction, decree, law, statute, rule or regulation applicable
to any Purchaser or any of their respective properties or assets.



Section 7.4. SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Disclosure Controls.



(a) The Purchaser Parent has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements
and other documents, including any exhibits thereto (collectively, the "
_Purchaser SEC Reports_ "), required to be filed by the Purchaser Parent with
the SEC since January 1, 2003. The Purchaser SEC Reports, including all forms,
reports and documents filed by the Purchaser Parent with the SEC after the
date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, (i) were and, in the case of
Purchaser SEC Reports filed after the date hereof, will be, prepared in all
material respects in accordance with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations thereunder, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or
if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then
on the date of such filing), and in the case of such forms, reports and
documents filed by the Purchaser with the SEC after the date of this
Agreement, will not as of the time they are filed, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated in such Purchaser SEC Reports or necessary in order to make the
statements in such Purchaser SEC Reports, in light of the circumstances under
which they were and will be made, not misleading. None of the
Purchaser Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports, schedules,
statements or other documents with the SEC.



(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes and schedules), contained in the Purchaser SEC
Reports, including any Purchaser SEC Reports filed between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing, complied or will comply, as of its respective date,
in all material respects with all applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was or will
be prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved and
fairly presented in all material respects or will fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Purchaser Parent
and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of the operations and cash flows of the Purchaser and
its consolidated subsidiaries for the periods indicated, except as otherwise
explained therein and except that any unaudited interim financial statements
are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which have not been
made and are not expected to be material in amount, individually or in the
aggregate. The audited financial statements of the Purchaser Parent contained
in the Purchaser SEC Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2003 are referred to herein as the " _Purchaser Financial Statements_."



(c) The chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Purchasers
have made all certifications required by, and would be able to make such
certifications as of the date hereof as of the Closing Date as if required to
be made as of such dates pursuant to, Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, and
the statements contained in any such certifications are complete and correct,
and the Purchaser is otherwise in compliance with all applicable effective
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing standards and
corporate governance rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market.



 

39 (d) Since December 28, 2003 the Purchaser and each Purchaser Subsidiary has
had in place "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) reasonably
designed and maintained to ensure that all information (both financial and
non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Purchaser in the reports that
it files or submits to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
the Purchasers management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of the Purchaser required under
the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. The Purchaser maintains
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or
specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets,
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.



Section 7.5. Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 7.5_ , the Purchasers have no obligations or liabilities (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent, unliquidated, or otherwise, whether due or to
become due, and regardless of when asserted) arising out of or relating to
the operation of its business at or before the Closing, except liabilities
reflected on the Purchaser Financial Statements.



Section 7.6. Consents and Approvals; No Violations. Except for filings,
permits, authorizations, consents and approvals, if any, as may be
required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, state securities or blue sky laws, and the HSR Act, and any filings under
similar notification laws or regulations of foreign Governmental Entities, no
other filing with or notice to and no permit, authorization, consent or
approval of any Governmental Entity is necessary for the execution and
delivery by the Purchasers of this Agreement, the performance of the
Purchasers obligations hereunder, or the consummation by the Purchasers of
the Transactions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party shall be entitled to recover for any

of representation or warranty made by Sellers in this Agreement, the
schedules, exhibits hereto or in any of the certificates or other instruments
or documents delivered by Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, or exhibits or

agreement or other provision by Sellers under this Agreement, or exhibits or
schedules hereto and except for claims relating to any of the matters
specifically set forth in (i) and (ii) above, the liability of the Sellers
hereunder shall be limited so that the Sellers shall not be obligated to pay
any amount for indemnification or otherwise under this Agreement in an
aggregate amount in excess of the Escrow Amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability in
amount or otherwise of the Sellers with respect to any fraud, criminal
activity or intentional breach by Sellers of any covenant contained in this
Agreement brought within the applicable statute of limitations for an action

harmless from and against, and pay on behalf of or reimburse such Purchaser
Parties in respect of, any Loss which any such Purchaser Party may suffer,

of the Business or any of the Purchased Assets, in each case prior to Closing,
except for the Assumed Obligations; and



(iv) any Retained Liabilities.



(b) _Limitations on Indemnification by the Sellers_. The indemnification
provided for in Sections 9.2(a)(i) and (ii) above is subject to the following
limitations:



(i) The Sellers shall be liable to the Purchaser Parties with respect to
claims referred to in Sections 9.2(a)(i) or (ii) only if a Purchaser Party
gives the Sellers written notice thereof within the Applicable Limitation

of claims for indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.2(a)(i) and (ii) shall
not exceed the Escrow Amount (the " _Cap_ ").



(iii) Claims for indemnification by the Purchaser Parties against the Sellers

shall be responsible for the full amount of such Losses or other amounts
(subject to any express limitations provided in this Agreement).



(iv) The Sellers shall not be liable to indemnify any Purchaser
Parties pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) unless and until the Purchaser Parties
have collectively suffered a Loss or aggregate Losses pursuant to such section
in excess of $500,000 in the aggregate (the " _Basket_ ") (at which point,
subject to the other limitations herein, the Sellers shall be liable to the
Purchaser Parties only for Losses incurred in excess of the Basket). The
foregoing limitation shall not apply with respect to Claims for
indemnification by the Purchaser Parties against the Sellers with respect to
the matters referred to in Section 9.2(a)(ii) above.

to the Sellers no later than the Applicable Limitation Date, the Sellers shall
be required to indemnify the Purchaser Parties for all Losses (subject to the
Basket and Cap limitations and the limitations set forth in Section 9.1)
which the Purchaser Parties may incur in respect of the matters which are the
subject of such claim, regardless of when incurred. Notwithstanding any
implication to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the limits on
indemnification set forth in this Agreement shall not apply to claims for
damages arising from fraud.



 

46 (c) _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. The Purchasers shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify the Sellers and each of the Sellers respective
officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, representatives,
Affiliates, successors, and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Parties_ ")
and hold each of them harmless from and against and pay on behalf of or
reimburse such Seller Parties in respect of any Loss which such Seller Party
may suffer, sustain, or become subject to, as a result of or relating to:



(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by any Purchaser
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by any Purchaser
with respect thereto in connection with the Closing;



(ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement made by any Purchaser contained
in this Agreement; or



(iii) the Assumed Obligations.

provided for in Sections 9.2(c)(i) and (ii) above is subject to the following
limitations:



(i) The Purchasers shall be liable to the Seller Parties with respect to
claims referred to in Sections 9.2(c)(i) or (ii) only if a Seller gives the
Purchasers written notice thereof within the Applicable Limitation Date.



(ii) The aggregate amount of all payments made by the Purchaser in
satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.2(c)(i) or
(ii) shall not exceed the Cap.



(iii) Claims for indemnification by the Seller Parties against the Purchasers
with respect to the matters referred to in Sections 9.2(c)(i) or (ii) above

Purchaser shall be responsible for the full amount of such Losses or other
amounts (subject to any express limitations provided in this Agreement).



(iv) The Purchasers shall not be liable to indemnify any Seller Parties
pursuant to Section 9.2(c)(i) unless and until the Seller Parties
have collectively suffered a Loss or aggregate Losses pursuant to such
section in excess of the Basket (at which point, subject to the other
limitations herein, the Purchasers shall be liable to the Seller Parties only
for Losses incurred in excess of the Basket). The foregoing limitation shall
not apply with respect to Claims for indemnification by the Seller Parties
against the Purchasers with respect to the matters referred to in Section
9.2(c)(ii) above.



(v) In addition to the indemnification rights provided hereunder, the
Seller Parties shall be entitled to all other rights and remedies available
in law or equity, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9.2.



Notwithstanding any implication to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
so long as a Seller delivers written notice of a claim to the Purchasers
no later than the Applicable Limitation Date, the Purchasers shall be
required to indemnify the Seller Parties for all Losses which the Seller
Parties may incur in respect of the matters which are the subject of such
claim, regardless of when incurred. Notwithstanding any implication to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the limits on indemnification set forth
in this Agreement shall not apply to claims for damages arising from fraud.



 

47 (e) _Procedures_. If a Party seeks indemnification under this Article IX, such
Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly give written notice to the
other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") after receiving written notice of
any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation, or other claim against it
(if by a third party) or discovering the liability, obligation, or facts
giving rise to such claim for indemnification, describing the claim, the
amount thereof (if known and quantifiable), and the basis thereof; provided
that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent such
failure shall have prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. In that regard, if any
action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation, or other claim shall be brought
or asserted by any third party which, if adversely determined, would entitle
the Indemnified Party to indemnity pursuant to this Article IX, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of the same
in writing, specifying in detail the basis of such claim and the facts
pertaining thereto and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate
in the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation, or other
claim giving rise to the Indemnified Partys claim for indemnification at the
Indemnifying Partys expense and option (subject to the limitations set forth
below) and shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel of such
defense which shall be counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party; provided that, as a condition precedent to the Indemnifying Partys
right to assume control of such defense, it must first agree in writing to be
fully responsible for all Losses relating to such claims and to provide full
indemnification to the Indemnified Party for all Losses relating to such
claim; and provided further that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees and expenses
of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party, if the claim which the
Indemnifying Party seeks to assume control (each, an " _Indemnified Party
Controlled Proceeding_ ") (i) involves a claim to which the Indemnified
Party reasonably believes could be materially detrimental to or injure the
Indemnified Partys reputation, customer or supplier relations or future
business prospects, (ii) seeks non-monetary relief from the Indemnified Party
(except where non-monetary relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or
claims for monetary damages), (iii) involves criminal allegations with respect
to the Indemnified Party, (iv) is one in which the Indemnifying Party is also
a party and joint representation would result in a conflict of interests or
as to the principal allegations there may be legal defenses available to the
Indemnified Party which are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party, or (v) involves a claim as to which, upon petition by
the Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party
failed or is failing to reasonably prosecute or defend. With respect to
actions, lawsuits, proceedings and investigations or other claims asserted by
a third party which are outstanding as of the Closing Date, if the Sellers are
currently defending such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other
claim, the Sellers shall have the right to control such defense subject to
the right of the Purchaser Parties to divest the Sellers of such right if such
action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim would be an
Indemnified Party Controlled Proceeding hereunder.



If the Indemnifying Party is permitted to assume and control the defense
and elects to do so, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
counsel separate from counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party in any such
action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnified Party.



If the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any such claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which shall not be unreasonably  



 

48  withheld) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to
defend such claim unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation
of law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no adverse effect on
any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party and (B) the
sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party.

 



Section 9.3. Certain Tax Matters.



(a) _Sellers to Pay_. The Sellers, and not the Purchasers, shall be required
to pay when due all Taxes of any kind or nature arising from (i) the conduct
or operation by the Sellers of the Business and (ii) the consummation of the
Transactions, including, without limitation, all excise, value added,
registration, stamp, property, documentary, transfer, sales, use and similar
Taxes, levies, charges and fees (including all real estate transfer Taxes)
incurred, or that may be payable to any Taxing authority, in connection with,
the Transactions (including without limitation the sale, transfer, and
delivery of the Purchased Assets) contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Transfer Taxes_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchasers may (but shall
not be obligated to) pay when due any such Taxes assessed against any of
them, or any of the Purchased Assets, but which are payable by the Sellers
pursuant hereto, if the Sellers failure to do so, in the reasonable judgment
of Purchasers, could result in the imposition of a Lien on any of the
Purchased Assets or any other assets of Purchasers or would constitute a
violation of any agreement to which Purchasers are subject, if any Seller
fails to contest such assessment or charge diligently and in good faith. If
Purchasers pay any Taxes which pursuant hereto are required to be borne by
the Sellers, Purchasers shall be entitled to reimbursement thereof from the
Sellers.



(b) _Transfer Tax Returns_. Seller Parent shall and shall cause each of the
other Sellers to file or cause to be filed all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes and the Sellers
shall bear the expense of such filings. If required by Applicable Law,
Purchasers shall join in the execution of any such Tax Returns of such other
documentation. 



(c) _Straddle Periods_. Subject to Section 9.3(a), all property taxes (other
than real estate transfer taxes), personal property taxes and similar ad
valorem obligations in respect of the Purchased Assets that relate to periods
beginning prior to the Closing Date and ending after the Closing
Date ("Straddle Periods") shall be prorated in accordance with the rules
provided in Section 164(d) of the Code. Purchaser Parent shall prepare or
cause to be prepared all Straddle Period Tax Returns, provided that Purchaser
Parent, acting in its sole discretion, may elect to have Seller Parent
prepare one or more Straddle Period Tax Returns by providing Seller Parent
notice of such election to Seller Parent at least sixty (60) days prior to the
due date of any such return. The Party preparing a Straddle Period Tax Return
(the "Preparing Party") shall provide each such return to the other Party for
review not less than twenty business days in advance of the due date thereof,
and such other Party shall pay to the Preparing Party its prorated portion of
the Tax shown to be due on each such return not less than five business days
before the due date of such payment. All Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this
Section 9.3(c) shall be prepared in accordance with past practices unless
otherwise required by law.



Section 9.4. Tax Indemnification. From and after the Closing Date, Seller
Parent shall and shall cause each other Seller to protect, defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the Purchasers from any and all Taxes imposed on the
Purchasers and any Loss resulting from (a) Taxes described in Section 9.3(a)
and 9.3(d)(i) above for all such taxable periods indicated therein; (b) Taxes
described in Section 9.3(c) which are allocated and prorated to the Sellers in
accordance with such section, (c) breaches of representations and warranties
in Section 6.11, (d) the Sellers failure to file the Tax  



 

49  Returns required to be filed by Sellers in accordance with Sections 9.3(b),
9.3(c) and 9.3(g) above, or (e) any Tax allocation or Tax sharing or
similar agreement, as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
indemnification under this Section 9.4 and the indemnification for Taxes set
forth elsewhere in Section 9.3 hereof shall not be subject to the Basket or
the Cap.



Section 9.5. Treatment of Indemnity Payments. All payments made by Sellers to
or for the benefit of Purchasers pursuant to any indemnification obligations
under this Agreement, will be treated as adjustments to the purchase price for
Tax purposes and such agreed treatment will govern for purposes of this
Agreement, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.



Section 9.6. Cooperation. To the extent relevant to the Purchased Assets, each
Party shall (a) provide the other assistance as may be reasonably requested
in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or the conduct of any
audit or examination or other proceeding and (b) retain and provide the other
with information that may be relevant to the preparation of a Tax Return, or
the conduct of an audit, examination or other proceeding relating to Taxes.



Section 9.7. Bulk Sales Laws. The Purchasers waive compliance by the Sellers
with the requirements of applicable bulk sales legislation in connection with
the completion of the Transactions. Seller Parent will and will cause
each other Seller to indemnify the Purchasers with respect to all Losses
which the Purchasers may incur or suffer as a result of the Sellers non-
compliance with such legislation, except to the extent that such costs,
expenses, damages or losses arise from the Purchasers failure to pay or
satisfy any of the Assumed Obligations.



Section 9.8. Section 338(g) Election. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, Sellers acknowledge and agree that Purchaser Parent may, at
its discretion, make one or more Code Section 338(g) elections with respect
to the Seller Subsidiaries.



ARTICLE X  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



Section 10.1. Press Releases and Announcements. Before the Closing Date, no
press releases related to this Agreement and the Transactions, or other
announcements to the employees, customers, or suppliers of the Sellers shall
be issued by any Party without the prior written consent of the Seller Parent
and the Purchaser Parent, except for any public disclosure which any Party in
good faith believes is required by law or regulation. After the Closing Date,
no press releases related to this Agreement and the Transactions shall be
issued by the Sellers without the prior approval of the Purchaser Parent,
except for any public disclosure which is required by law or regulation.



Section 10.2. Specific Performance. Seller Parent acknowledges that the
Business is unique and recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach
of this Agreement by the Sellers, money damages may be inadequate and the
Purchaser may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Seller Parent
agrees that the Purchaser shall have the right, in addition to any other
rights and remedies existing in its favor, to enforce its rights and the
Sellers obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages
but also by an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive, or
other equitable relief.



Section 10.3. Expenses. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein,
the Parties shall pay all of their own fees, costs, and expenses (including,
without limitation, fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel, investment
bankers, brokers, or other representatives and consultants and appraisal  



 

50  fees, costs, and expenses) incurred in connection with the negotiation of
this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby, the performance
of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation of the
Transactions; provided, however, that Seller Parent and Purchaser Parent shall
share equally (i) all fees and expenses, other than attorneys and accountants
fees and expenses, incurred in relation to the printing and filing (with the
SEC) of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including any preliminary materials
related thereto) and the Registration Statement (including financial
statements and exhibits) and any amendments or supplements thereto and (ii)
all fees and expenses, other than attorneys and accountants fees, in
connection with any filings under the HSR Act.



Section 10.4. No Solicitation by the Seller Parent; Etc.



 

(a) The Seller Parent shall, and shall cause the Seller Subsidiaries and the
Sellers respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to a
Takeover Proposal. Seller Parent shall not, and shall cause each other Seller
and their respective subsidiaries and Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or proposals that
constitute, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal,
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third party
regarding any Takeover Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement related to
any Takeover Proposal; _provided, however_ , that if after the date hereof the
Board of Directors of the Seller Parent receives an unsolicited, bona fide
written Takeover Proposal in circumstances not involving a breach of this
Agreement and the Board of Directors of the Seller Parent determines in good
faith that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to
result in, a Superior Proposal and with respect to which such
Board determines in good faith, after considering applicable provisions of
California law and after consulting with and receiving the advice of outside
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Seller Parents stockholders under California law,
then the Seller Parent may, at any time prior to obtaining the Seller
Stockholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Seller Stockholder
Approval) and after providing Purchaser Parent not less than 48 hours written
notice of its intention to take such actions, (A) furnish information with
respect to the Seller Parent and its subsidiaries to the Person making such
Takeover Proposal, but only after such Person enters into a customary
confidentiality agreement with the Seller Parent (which confidentiality
agreement will have provisions regarding treatment of confidential information
no less favorable to the Seller Parent in any material respect than the
confidentiality agreement between the parties to this Agreement), _provided_
that (1) such new confidentiality agreement may not include any provision
calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Seller Parent and (2) the
Seller Parent advises Purchaser Parent of all such non-public information
delivered to such Person concurrently with its delivery to such Person and
concurrently with its delivery to such Person the Seller Parent delivers to
Purchaser Parent all such information not previously provided to Purchaser
Parent, (B) participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person
regarding such Takeover Proposal and (C) enter into the confidentiality
agreement contemplated by clause (A) of this proviso. The Seller Parent shall
take all action necessary to enforce each confidentiality, standstill or
similar agreement to which the Seller Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of them is bound (in each case, other than any such
agreement with Purchaser Parent). Without limiting the foregoing, it is
understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
10.4(a) by the Sellers or their respective Representatives shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Section 10.4(a) by the Seller Parent.



 

51 (b) In addition to the other obligations of the Seller Parent set forth in
this Section 10.4, Seller Parent shall promptly advise Purchaser Parent,
orally and in writing, and in no event later than the later of 48 hours or one
business day after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact
is initially received by, any information is initially requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the
Seller Parent in respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any such
notice to Purchaser Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such
proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or
contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials
received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer,
inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep Purchaser Parent fully
informed of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any
such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and the Seller Parent shall
provide Purchaser Parent with copies of any additional written materials
received that relate to such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests) and of
the status of any such discussions or negotiations. 



(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 10.4(c), neither the Board
of Directors of Seller Parent nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw
or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Purchaser Parent, the Seller Board Recommendation or (B) approve
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover
Proposal or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, or cause or authorize Seller Parent or any of its subsidiaries to
enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of
understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or
other agreement related to any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement in accordance with Section 10.4(a)) (each, a " _Seller Acquisition
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, (x) the Board of Directors of the Seller Parent may withdraw or
modify the Seller Board Recommendation, or recommend a Takeover Proposal, if
such Board determines in good faith, after reviewing applicable provisions of
California law and after consulting with and receiving advice from outside
counsel, that the failure to make such withdrawal, modification
or recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Seller Parents shareholders under California law and (y) if the Board of
Directors of Seller Parent receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover
Proposal that was made in circumstances not involving a breach of this
Agreement and that such Board determines in good faith constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Board of Directors of Seller Parent may, in response to such
Superior Proposal and within the five business day period described below,
cause Seller Parent to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal but only if Seller Parent shall have concurrently with
entering into such definitive agreement terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(d) and prior thereto or concurrently therewith paid the
Termination Fee required pursuant to Section 8.3, but in any event only after
the fifth business day following Purchaser Parents receipt of written notice
(the " _Notice_ ") from the Seller Parent advising Purchaser Parent that the
Board of Directors of Seller Parent is prepared to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and terminate this
Agreement (it being understood that Seller Parent shall be required to
deliver a new Notice in respect of any revised Superior Proposal (other than
immaterial revisions) from such third party or its Affiliates that Seller
Parent proposes to accept, attaching the most current version of such
agreement to such Notice (which version shall be updated on a current basis),
and only if, during such five business day period, Seller Parent and its
Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith with Purchaser Parent and
Purchaser Parents Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms of
this Agreement as would enable Purchaser Parent to proceed with the
Transactions on such adjusted terms and, at the end of such five business
day period, after taking into account any such adjusted terms as may have
been proposed by Purchaser Parent in writing (and not withdrawn) since its
receipt of such Notice, the Board of Directors of the Company has again in
good faith made the determination referred to above in this clause (y).



 

52 (d) For purposes of this Agreement:



(i) " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other
than Purchaser Parent or any Affiliate and relating to any (A) direct or
indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions) of more than 50% of the Purchased Assets, (B) direct or
indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions) of more than 50% of any class of equity securities of any of the
Sellers, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result
in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
beneficially owning more than 50% of any class of equity securities of the
Sellers or (D) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
any of the Sellers; in each case, other than the Transactions.



(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a Takeover Proposal to acquire, directly or
indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, all of
the equity securities of the Seller Parent or all or substantially all of the
Purchased Assets, made by a third party, which is not subject to a financing
contingency and which is otherwise on terms and conditions which the Board of
Directors of the Seller Parent determines in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with a financial advisor of national reputation) to be more
favorable to the Seller Parents shareholders from a financial point of view
than the Transactions, taking into account at the time of determination any
changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been proposed
by Parent Purchaser in writing (and not withdrawn) and the relative ability of
the Person making such proposal to consummate the transactions contemplated
by such proposal (based upon, among other things, the availability of
financing and the expectation of obtaining required approvals) as compared to
the ability of the Purchaser Parent to consummate the Transactions.



Section 10.5. Noncompetition, Nonsolicitation, and Confidentiality. From and
after the Closing:



(a) _Noncompetition_. In consideration of the mutual covenants provided for
herein to each of the Sellers at the Closing, Seller Parent shall not and
shall cause each other Seller and its and their respective Affiliates not to
engage (whether as an owner, operator, manager, employee, officer, director,
consultant, advisor, representative, or otherwise) during the period beginning
on the Closing Date and ending on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing
Date directly in any business that commercially manufactures, sells or
markets products that have substantially the same functional attributes of the
products of the Business as at the Closing Date. The Parties hereto agree that
the covenant set forth in this Section 10.5 is reasonable with respect to its
duration, geographical area, and scope. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Section
10.5 is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term
or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the
expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.



 

53 (b) The covenants contained in the preceding paragraphs shall be construed as
a series of separate covenants, one for each county, city and state of any
geographic area where any business is carried on by Purchasers and their
subsidiaries. Except for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant
shall be deemed identical in terms to the covenant contained in the preceding
paragraphs. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court refuses to enforce any of
such separate covenants (or any part thereof), then such unenforceable
covenant (or portions thereof) shall be eliminated from this Agreement to the
extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions
thereof) to be enforced. In the event that the provisions of this Section 10.5
are deemed to exceed the time, geographic or scope limitations permitted
by Applicable Law, then such provisions shall be reformed to the maximum
time, geographic or scope limitations, as the case may be, permitted by
Applicable Laws.



 

(c) _Nonsolicitation_. Seller Parent agrees that, during the period beginning
on the Closing Date and ending on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing
Date (the " _Nonsolicitation Period_ "), it shall not and shall cause each
other Seller and its and their respective Affiliates not to (i) directly or
indirectly contact, approach, or solicit for the purpose of
offering employment to or hiring (whether as an employee, consultant, agent,
independent contractor or otherwise) or actually hire any Person employed by
the Sellers in the Business immediately prior to the Closing Date who becomes
an employee of a Purchaser immediately following the Closing Date, without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser Parent, and (ii) induce or attempt
to induce any customer or other business relation of the Sellers into any
business relationship which might materially harm any of the Purchasers.



(d) _Confidentiality_. After the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall and shall
cause each other Seller and its and their respective Affiliates to treat and
hold as confidential any information concerning the Business of the Sellers
(including, without limitation, all Proprietary Rights included in the
Purchased Assets) that is not already generally available to the public (the "
_Confidential Information_ "), refrain from using any of the Confidential
Information except in connection with this Agreement, and at any time upon
the reasonable request of the Purchaser Parent deliver promptly to the
Purchaser Parent or destroy, at the request and option of the Purchaser
Parent, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the Confidential
Information which are included within the Purchased Assets and which are in
its possession or under its control following the Closing Date. In the event
that after the Closing Date any Seller, or any of its Affiliates, is requested
or required (by oral question or request for information or documents in any
legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or
similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, the Seller Parent
shall notify the Purchaser Parent promptly of the request or requirement so
that the Purchaser Parent may seek an appropriate protective order or waive
compliance with the provisions of this Section 10.5(d). If, in the absence of
a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, a Seller or any of
its Affiliates is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any
Confidential Information to any tribunal, such Seller or its Affiliate may
disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal; provided that such
Seller shall (and it will cause its Affiliates to) use its reasonable Best
Efforts to obtain, at the request and sole cost and expense of the Purchaser
Parent, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment shall be
accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as the Purchaser Parent shall designate.



Section 10.6. Transition Services Agreements. Seller Parent and Purchaser
Parent shall negotiate in good faith prior to the Closing a transition
services agreement reflecting the parameters set forth in the Transition
Services Parameters attached hereto as _Schedule 10.6_.



 

54 Section 10.7. Transition Services Agreement. Seller Parent and Purchaser
Parent shall negotiate in good faith transition services agreements relating
to the ODU business unit and the EMS business unit with respect to the matters
described in _Schedule 10.7_.



Section 10.8. Financial Statements. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement, Seller Parent shall provide to Purchaser
Parent the combined financial statements of the Sellers required for inclusion
in the Purchaser Parents Current Report on Form 8-K, and such financial
statements (a) will comply as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (b) will be
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
(c) will fairly present the combined financial position of the Sellers at the
respective dates thereof and the results of its operations and cash flows for
the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements
will be subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which are not
expected to be material in amount.



Section 10.9. Nasdaq National Stock Market. Purchaser Parent shall use its
reasonable Best Efforts to cause the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be
issued hereunder to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Stock
Market, subject to official notice of issuance, contemporaneous with the

Section 10.10. Certain Filings; Reasonable Efforts.



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties
hereto will use all reasonable efforts and due diligence to take or cause
to be taken all action and to do or cause to be done all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate and make
effective the Transactions, including using all reasonable efforts and due
diligence to do the following: (i) cooperate in the preparation of any
filings that may be required under the HSR Act, the WARN Act and any filings
under similar notification laws or regulations of foreign Governmental
Entities; (ii) obtain consents of all third parties and Governmental Entities
necessary, proper, advisable or reasonably requested by Purchaser Parent or
the Seller Parent, for the consummation of the Transactions; (iii) contest any
legal proceeding relating to the Transactions; and (iv) execute any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser Parent agrees to use its
reasonable Best Efforts to cause the Closing Date to occur as soon as
reasonably practicable after the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 have
been satisfied or waived. If at any time after the Closing Date any further
action is reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the proper officers and directors of each party hereto shall take all such
necessary action.



(b) Purchaser Parent and the Seller Parent will reasonably consult and
cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, letters,
white papers, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings
under or relating to the HSR Act, or any other foreign, federal or state
antitrust, competition or fair trade law. In this regard, each party hereto
shall promptly inform the other of any material communication between such
party and the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice, the SEC or any other federal, foreign or state
antitrust or competition Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions.
Nothing in this Agreement, however, shall require or be construed to require
any party hereto to sell or divest any assets or business or to restrict any
business operations in order to obtain the consent or successful termination
of any review of any such Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions.



 

55 Section 10.11. Additions to and Modification of Disclosure Schedule.
Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Party
has delivered a Disclosure Schedule that includes all of the information
required by the relevant provisions of this Agreement. In addition, either
Party may deliver to the other party such additions to or modifications of
any Sections of the Disclosure Schedule necessary to make the information set
forth therein true, accurate and complete in all material respects as soon as
practicable after such information is available to such Party after the date
of execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing and,
solely in cases where the additions or modifications of any Sections of the
Disclosure Schedule disclose matters which the Party making such
disclosures does not have Knowledge of such matters as of the date hereof,
such disclosures shall be deemed to constitute an exception to the
representations and warranties of such Party under this Agreement; provided,
that any such additional disclosure by Sellers shall not affect the ability
of Purchaser Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i)
provided that Purchaser Parent seeks to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(i) within ten business days of receipt of such disclosure; and
provided, further, that any such additional disclosure by Purchasers shall not
affect the ability of Seller Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i) within ten business days of
receipt of such disclosure.



Section 10.12. Access to Employees. The Seller Parent shall provide Purchaser
Parent with reasonable access to employees of each of the Sellers who work

this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date to provide information to such
employees about Purchasers and such employees continued employment.
All communications by Purchaser Parent with employees of the Sellers shall be
conducted in a manner that shall not disrupt or interfere with the efficient
and orderly operation of the Business.



Section 10.13. REMEC Name. Following the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall
not and shall cause each of the other Sellers not to transfer, license or
otherwise grant the right to use the "REMEC" name, in any manner, to any
Person, other than the Purchasers, engaged directly or indirectly in any
business that commercially manufactures, sells or markets products that have
substantially the same functional attributes of the products of the Business
as at the Closing Date.



Section 10.14. Immigration Matters. With regard to matters occurring after the
Closing Date only, Purchasers agree to assume all the immigration related
rights, obligations, and liabilities of the Sellers in relation to foreign
nationals employed by the Sellers in nonimmigrant status in connection with
the operation of the Business; provided, that the Purchasers shall not assume
any such liabilities arising out of any violation by the Sellers of Applicable
Law. The terms and conditions of employment of such foreign national employees
by the Purchasers shall, to the extent such terms and conditions relate to or
otherwise affect such employees nonimmigrant status, remain the same as the
current terms and conditions of employment of such employees by the Sellers;
provided, that, nothing contained herein shall obligate the Purchasers to
employ or retain any such employee following the Closing Date.



Section 10.15. License to REMEC Name. Effective and conditioned upon the
Closing, Seller Parent hereby grants to Purchasers a perpetual, non-exclusive,
worldwide, fully-paid, royalty-free license to reproduce and use the "REMEC"
name and all related trademarks held by the Seller Parent, in connection with
Purchasers repair of products in connection with the Business that were  



 

56  sold by Sellers prior to the Closing. In addition, effective and conditioned
upon the Closing, Seller Parent hereby grants to Purchasers a limited non-
exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, royalty-free license to reproduce and use
the "REMEC" name and all related trademarks held by the Seller Parent in
connection with Purchasers sale of products out of existing inventory
included in the Purchased Assets, which license shall terminate nine (9)
months from the Closing Date, unless extended upon mutual agreement of Seller
Parent and Purchaser Parent. In addition to the foregoing, Seller Parent shall
cause each of the other Sellers to honor the licenses granted to Purchasers
pursuant to this Section 10.15.



Section 10.16. Computer Software and Hardware Licenses. Following the date
hereof and prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser Parent and Seller Parent shall
evaluate the computer software and hardware licenses set forth on _Schedule
2.1(i)_ hereto and shall mutually agree upon which portion(s) of such licenses
(if not the entire license) shall be assigned to Purchasers to ensure that the
Purchasers shall have sufficient access to the software and hardware that is
subject to such licenses, to the extent required to enable Purchasers to
conduct the Business in the same manner as it was conducted prior to the
Closing Date.



Section 10.17. VAT Receivables. Following the date hereof, Purchaser Parent
shall use its Best Efforts to assist Sellers in the recovery of any VAT
amounts that have been paid by Sellers with respect to products sold by
Sellers prior to the Closing Date and which amounts have not been collected by
Sellers as of the Closing Date.

Section 11.5. Rules of Construction.



(a) All references in this Agreement to "dollars" or "$" shall mean United
States dollars.



(b) References to any United States legal term for any action, remedy,

or any legal concept or thing shall, in respect of any jurisdiction other than
the State of California, be deemed to include that which most nearly
approximates in that jurisdiction the United States legal term.



 

58 (c) Where it is necessary to determine whether a monetary limit or threshold
set forth in Section 9 has been reached or exceeded (as the case may be) and
the value of any of the relevant claims is expressed in a currency other than
United States dollars, the value of each such claim shall be translated into
United States dollars at the then applicable exchange rate for such currency
on the date of receipt of written notification of the existence of such claim.



(d) In the event there is any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and
the terms of any ancillary agreement, the terms of this Agreement

(e) "Include(s)" or "including" means "include(s), without limitation" or
"including, without limitation," as the case may be, and the language
following "include(s)" or "including" shall not be deemed to set forth an
exhaustive list. 



(f) The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language
chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any Person. The Parties hereto have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the

favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the

prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or between
the Parties, written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.



Section 11.8. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. All questions concerning the
construction, validity, and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of

provision that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the state or federal courts of the State of Delaware for any
litigation, proceeding or action arising out of or relating to this Agreement

action relating thereto except in such courts). Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of
venue of any litigation, proceeding or action arising out of this Agreement or
the Transactions in the state or federal courts of the State of Delaware and
hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead
or claim in any such court that any such litigation, proceeding or action
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each
party hereto hereby consents to process being served in any such litigation,
proceeding or action by the mailing of a copy thereof to the address set forth
in Section 11.2 hereof below its name and agrees that such service upon
receipt shall constitute good and sufficient service of process or notice
thereof. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect or eliminate any right to
