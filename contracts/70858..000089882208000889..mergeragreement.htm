 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Company, Parent and Merger Sub have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which Merger Sub will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into Company (the " _Merger_ "), with Company as the surviving company in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Company_ ");

 

 WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is the intent of the parties hereto that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code;

 

 WHEREAS, as an inducement and condition to the entrance of Bank of America into this Agreement, Company is granting to Bank of America an option pursuant to a stock option agreement in the form set forth in Exhibit A (the " _Stock Option Agreement_ "); and

 

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.

 

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 

    ARTICLE I 
  
 THE MERGER 
--- 

 

 1.1 _The Merger_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into Company. Company shall be the Surviving Company in the Merger and shall continue its existence as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. (b) Parent may at any time change the method of effecting the combination (including by providing for the merger of Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent other than Merger Sub) if and to the extent requested by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of Companys stockholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration or the Tax treatment of either party pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") that shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date. The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Certificate of Merger.

 

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL.

 

 1.4 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

 

 (a) Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.33 1/3 per share, of the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

 (b) All shares of common stock, par value $1.33 1/3 per share, of Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") that are owned by Company or Parent (other than shares of Company Common Stock held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties (any such shares, " _Trust Accoun_ _t_ _Common Shares_ ") and other than shares of Company Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Company or Parent in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such shares, " _DPC_ _Common Shares_ ")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of Company Common Stock held by any wholly-owned subsidiary of Company or Parent shall be converted into such number of shares of stock of the Surviving Company such that each such subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding common stock of the Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time as such subsidiary owned in Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 (c) Subject to Section 1.4(f), each share of Company Common Stock, except for shares of Company Common Stock owned by Company or Parent (other than Trust Account Common Shares and DPC Common Shares), shall be converted, in accordance with the

  procedures set forth in Article II, into the right to receive 0.8595 (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") of a share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

 (d) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.3(f), as well as any dividends to which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled in accordance with Section 2.3(c) .

Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock in which
such Company Deferred Equity Units are denominated immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole
share) (a " _Parent Deferred Equity Unit_ "), and otherwise on the same terms

    DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION 
--- 

 

 2.1 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company Subsidiary of Parent or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to 

  Company, or Parents transfer agent, pursuant to an agreement (the " _Exchange
Agent_ _Agreement_ ") to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
hereunder.

 

 2.2 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) authorize the Exchange Agent to issue an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration, and (ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited with, the Exchange Agent, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3(f) (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

 2.3 _Delivery of Merger Consideration._

 

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Letter of_ _Transmittal_ ")) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c) .

 

 (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.

 

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a

  payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Parent Common Stock issuable
with respect to such Certificate.

 

 (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of Company, the fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the Merger Consideration shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the earlier of (x) the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time and (y) the expiration or termination of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be.

 

 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

 

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, each former stockholder of Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share shall be paid an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to such holders proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale or sales in the open market by the Exchange Agent, on behalf of all such holders, of the aggregate fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise have been issued pursuant to this Article II. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent over (ii) the aggregate number of full shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to 

   holders of shares of Company Common Stock (such excess, the " _Excess
Shares_ "), and the Exchange Agent, as agent for the former holders of Company
Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at the prevailing prices on the New
York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "). The sale of the Excess Shares by the
Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms
of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. All
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs,
including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred
in connection with such sale of Excess Shares shall reduce, but not below
zero, the amount of cash paid to former stockholders of Company in respect of
fractional shares. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the
proceeds of such sale to which each former holder of Company Common Stock
shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the proceeds of such
sale by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of fractional share
interests to which such holder of Company Common Stock is entitled (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective
Time by such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all holders of Company Common Stock are
entitled. Until the proceeds of such sale have been distributed to the former
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the Exchange Agent will hold such
proceeds in trust for such former holders. As soon as practicable after
the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to such former holders of
shares of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional interests, the
Exchange Agent shall make available in accordance with this Agreement such
amounts to such former holders of shares of Company Common Stock.

 

  (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time may
be paid to Parent. In such event, any former stockholders of Company who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any
fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such
stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable
to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

 

  (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required
by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

Company has determined unanimously that this Agreement is advisable and in
the best interests of Company and its stockholders and has directed that this
Agreement be submitted to Companys stockholders for approval and adoption at

the foregoing effect. Except for the approval and adoption of this Agreement
by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares

the Stock Option Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. This Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement have been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Company and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub) constitute the
valid and binding obligations of Company, enforceable against Company in
accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization or
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the rights of
creditors generally and subject to general principles of equity (the "
_Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ")).

 3.5 _Reports; Regulatory Matters_.

 

 (a) Company and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports, registrations, statements and certifications, together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file since January 1, 2006 with (i) FINRA, (ii) the SEC, (iii) the Office of Thrift Supervision (the " _OTS_ "), (iv) the FDIC, (v) the NYSE, (vi) any state consumer finance, mortgage banking or insurance regulatory authority or agency, (vii) any non-U.S. regulatory authority and (viii) any SRO (collectively, " _Regulatory Agencies_ ") and with each other applicable Governmental Entity, and all other reports and statements required to be filed by them since January 1, 2006, including any report or statement required to be filed pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of the United States, any state, any non-U.S. entity, or any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity, and have paid all fees and assessments

   due and payable in connection therewith. Except for normal examinations
conducted by a Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity in the ordinary
course of the business of Company and its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency
or other Governmental Entity has initiated since January 1, 2006 or has
pending any proceeding, enforcement action or, to the knowledge of Company,
investigation into the business, disclosures or operations of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2006, no Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity has resolved any proceeding, enforcement action or, to the
knowledge of Company, investigation into the business, disclosures or
operations of Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no unresolved, or,
to Companys knowledge, threatened criticism, comment, exception or stop order
by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity with respect to any
report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2006, there have been no formal or
informal inquiries by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory
Agency or other Governmental Entity with respect to the business, operations,
policies or procedures of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Entity in Companys ordinary course of business).

 

  (b) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
cease-and-desist or other order or formal or informal enforcement action
issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has been since January 1,
2006 a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2006 has
adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or
suggestion of, any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that
currently restricts or affects in any material respect the conduct of its
business (or to Companys knowledge that, upon consummation of the Merger,
would restrict in any material respect the conduct of the business of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries), or that in any material manner relates to its
capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit, risk management or
compliance policies, its internal controls, its management or its business,
other than those of general application that apply to similarly situated
companies or their Subsidiaries (each item in this sentence, a " _Company
Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Company or any of its Subsidiaries been
advised since January 1, 2006 by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting
any such Company Regulatory Agreement. The Company and each of its
subsidiaries are currently in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations relating to capital adequacy and, to the knowledge of Company,
there has not been any event or occurrence since January 1, 2006 that would
result in a determination that Merrill Lynch Bank and Trust Co., FSB or Merrill
Lynch Bank USA is not "well capitalized" as a matter of applicable banking
law.

 

  (c) Company has previously made available to Parent an accurate and
complete copy of each (i) final registration statement, prospectus, report,
schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or furnished to the SEC by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") since
January 1, 2006 (the " _Company SEC Reports_ ") and prior to the date of this
Agreement and (ii) communication mailed by Company to its stockholders since
January 1, 2006 and prior to the date of this Agreement. No such Company
SEC Report or communication, at the time filed, furnished or communicated
(and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on

  the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings,
respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but
before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of
an earlier date. As of their respective dates, all Company SEC Reports
complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. Each current Subsidiary of
Company that has filed since January 1, 2006 a Form S-3 registration statement
with the SEC meets the requirements for the use of Form S-3, and no event has
occurred that would reasonably be expected to result in Form S-3 eligibility
requirements no longer being satisfied by any such Subsidiary. No executive
officer of Company has failed in any respect to make the certifications
required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ").

 

 3.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

 (a) The financial statements of Company and its Subsidiaries included (or incorporated by reference) in the Company SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders equity and consolidated financial position of Company and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to recurring year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements. Deloitte and Touche LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as independent public accountants of Company as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Company on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 

 (b) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability or obligation of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent, determined, determinable or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for (i) those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Company included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2008 (including any notes thereto) and (ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since June 27, 2008 or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Company and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the

   exclusive ownership and direct control of Company or its Subsidiaries or
accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for
any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the system of internal
accounting controls described below in this Section 3.6(c) . Company (x) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Company by
others within those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Companys outside auditors and the
audit committee of Companys Board of Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Companys internal controls over
financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to
Companys auditors and audit committee, a copy of which has previously been
made available to Parent. As of the date hereof, there is no reason to believe
that Companys outside auditors, chief executive officer and chief financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

 

  (d) Since December 28, 2007, (i) neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of Company, any director, officer,
employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Company or any of its

material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Company or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Company
or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of Company.

 

  3.7 _Broker s Fees_. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents has utilized
any broker, finder or financial advisor or incurred any liability for any
brokers fees, commissions or finders fees in connection with the Merger or
any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than as set forth
in Section 3.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and pursuant to letter
agreements, true, complete and correct copies of which have been previously
delivered to Parent.

event or events have occurred that have had or would reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Company. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ "
means, with respect to Parent or Company, as the case may be, a
material adverse effect on (i) the financial condition, results of operations
or business of such

   party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that,

(E) the execution of this Agreement or the public disclosure of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including acts of competitors or

thereof or (G) changes in the trading price of a partys common stock, in and
of itself, but not including any underlying causes, except, with respect to

disproportionately adverse to the financial condition, results of operations
or business of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared
to other companies in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries
operate) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

anticipated claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of
or against any of the Company Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto
which could reasonably be expected to result in any liability of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary.

 

  (c) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code (a "
_Nonqualified Deferred_ _Compensation Plan_ ") and any award thereunder, in
each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has been operated in

 6.1 _Regulatory Matters_. (a) Parent and Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and Company shall thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to its stockholders. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Company shall furnish all information concerning Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 

 (b) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties (including any unions, works councils or other labor organizations) and Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties or Governmental Entities. Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, all the information relating to Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and

Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

  (d) Each of Parent and Company shall promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or
approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is
a reasonable likelihood that any Parent Requisite Regulatory Approval or
Company Requisite Regulatory Approval, respectively, will not be obtained or
that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed.

 

  6.2 _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, each of
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford
to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other

hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period, such
party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other
party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other

permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other party may
reasonably request (in the case of access or a request by Company, the
foregoing rights provided by this Section 6.2(a) shall be limited to
information concerning Parent that is reasonably related to the prospective
value of Parent Common Stock or to Parents ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby). Neither Company nor Parent, nor any of
their Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

  (b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement
shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered
into between the parties as of September 14, 2008 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

affect the representations and warranties of the other party set forth in
this Agreement.

    6.3 _Stockholder Approval_. Each of Company and Parent shall call a
meeting of its stockholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for
the purpose of obtaining the requisite stockholder approval required in
connection with the Merger, on substantially the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
such meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. The Board of
Directors of Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its
stockholders the stockholder vote approving the Merger, on substantially the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall recommend
such approval except to the extent expressly permitted under Section 6.10(d)
. Company shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders at the stockholder
meeting even if its Board of Directors shall have withdrawn, modified or
qualified its recommendation. The Board of Directors of Company has adopted
resolutions approving the Merger, on substantially the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and directing that the Merger, on such terms and
conditions, be submitted to Companys stockholders for their consideration.
The Board of Directors of Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from its stockholders the stockholder vote approving the issuance of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger, on substantially the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, required to consummate the issuance of Parent
Common Stock contemplated by this Agreement, and shall recommend such approval
except to the extent making such recommendation would cause the Board of
Directors of Parent to violate its fiduciary duties to Parent stockholders
under applicable law. Parent shall submit the stock issuance proposal to its
stockholders at the stockholder meeting even if its Board of Directors
shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation. The Board of
Directors of Parent has adopted resolutions approving the Merger, on
substantially the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and

  6.4 _NYSE Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

  6.5 _Employee Matters_. (a) For the period from the Effective Time
through December 31, 2009, Parent shall maintain or cause to be maintained
employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the benefit of
employees (as a group) who are actively employed by Company and its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (" _Covered Employees_ ") that provide
employee benefits and compensation opportunities which, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to the employee benefits and compensation
opportunities that were provided to such Covered Employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

 

  (b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to
participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, Parent shall (i) cause such employee benefit plan to recognize
the service of such Covered Employee with Company or its Subsidiaries (or
their predecessor entities) for purposes of eligibility, participation,
vesting, and, except under defined benefit pension plans, benefit accrual
under such employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, without limitation, for purposes of the Company Stock Plans, the
Company Cap Plan and the Company Deferred Equity Unit Plans as assumed by
Parent pursuant to Section 1.5), to the same extent such service was
recognized immediately

  prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which
such Covered Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that such recognition of service shall not operate
to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to the same
period of service, and (ii) with respect to any health, dental, vision or
other welfare plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Company
and its Subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate
for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to
participate, use its reasonable best efforts to (x) cause any pre-existing
condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such Parent or
Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee, to the
extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company
Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and (y) recognize any health, dental or vision expenses
incurred by such Covered Employee in the year that includes the Closing Date
(or, if later, the year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to
participate) for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-
pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect as of the date hereof or as may be amended after the date hereof (i) with the prior written consent of Parent or (ii) as permitted pursuant to Section 5.2(c) of this Agreement, each Company Benefit Plan.

 

 (d) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall be construed to limit the right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this Section 6.5 be construed to prohibit the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) from terminating the employment of any particular Covered Employee following the Closing Date.

 

 (e) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.10, the provisions of this Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan for any purpose.

 

 6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a " _Claim_ "), including any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this 

   Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time,
the parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend
against and respond thereto. All rights to indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in their
respective certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents), and any indemnification agreements which are
existing as of the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time or taken at the request of Parent pursuant to Section 6.7, it
being understood that nothing in this sentence shall require any amendment to
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Company.

 

  (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to,
each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in
connection with any Claim based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or
in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and pertaining to any matter existing or
occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time
(including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) or taken at the request of Parent pursuant
to Section 6.7.

 

  (c) Parent shall cause the individuals serving as officers and
directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective
Time by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by
Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors
in their capacity as such; provided that in no event shall Parent be required
to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 250% of the annual
premiums currently paid by Company (which current amount is set forth in
Section 6.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance (the "
_Insurance Amount_ "), and provided further that if Parent is unable to
maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as a result of the preceding
proviso, Parent shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for
the Insurance Amount.

 

  (d) The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

 

  6.7 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the
one hand, and a Subsidiary of Company, on the other) or to vest the Surviving
Company with full title to all properties, assets, rights,

  approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper
officers and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall,
at Parents sole expense, take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by Parent.

 

 6.8 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Parent and Company shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; and _provided further_ that a failure to comply with this Section 6.8 shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied.

 

 6.9 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Company shall each take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate, and the parties shall cooperate with each other as necessary, to cause any deemed disposition of shares of Company Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock or any deemed acquisition of shares of Parent Common Stock by an individual who after the Merger is expected to be subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent, in each case in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

 6.10 _No Solicitation_.

 

 (a) None of Company, its Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals, including the indication of any intention to propose any of the foregoing, being referred to herein as an " _Alternative Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of Company shall be permitted, prior to the meeting of Company stockholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, and subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 6.10 and to first entering into a confidentiality agreement with the person proposing such Alternative Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to Company than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to consider and participate in discussions and negotiations with respect to a bona fide Alternative Proposal received by Company, and furnish information in connection therewith (provided that the Company shall simultaneously provide to Parent any such information that was not

   previously provided to Parent) if and only to the extent that and so long as
the Board of Directors of Company determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would cause it to violate
its fiduciary duties to Company stockholders under applicable law.

 

  As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of
(i) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other
than Parent or its affiliates), directly or indirectly, acquires or would
acquire more than 15% of the outstanding shares of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of
preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect
to a merger with Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether from Company or
pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger,
share exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Merger), (iii) any transaction
pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than Parent or its
affiliates) acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this
purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of Company
and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination
including any of Companys Subsidiaries) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries
representing more than 15% of the fair market value of all the assets, net
revenues or net income of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
immediately prior to such transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

  (b) Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours) after receipt of any Alternative Proposal, or any material modification
of or material amendment to any Alternative Proposal, or any request for
nonpublic information relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for
access to the properties, books or records of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than any such request that does not relate to and would
not reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal. Such notice to
Parent shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of
the person making the Alternative Proposal or intending to make or
considering making an Alternative Proposal or requesting non-public
information or access to the books and records of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and a copy (if in writing) and summary of the material terms of
any such Alternative Proposal or modification or amendment to an Alternative
Proposal. Company shall use its best efforts to keep Parent fully informed, on
a current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material
changes or modifications in the terms of any such Alternative Proposal,
indication or request. Company shall also provide Parent 24 hours written
notice before it enters into any discussions or negotiations concerning any
Alternative Proposal in accordance with Section 6.10(a) . The Company shall
not enter into any confidentiality or other agreement that would impede its
ability to comply with its obligations under this Section 6.10(b) .

 

  (c) Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any persons (other
than Parent) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all persons other than Parent who
have been furnished confidential information regarding Company in connection
with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Alternative Proposal
within the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy
such information.

   Company agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any
third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any
agreement to which Company or its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and
shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may
have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any person to
make an Alternative Proposal. Neither Company nor the Board of Directors of
Company shall approve or take any action to render inapplicable to any
Alternative Proposal or Alternative Transaction Section 203 of the DGCL or any
similar Takeover Statutes.

 

  (d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.10(d), neither the
Board of Directors of Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, the
recommendation by the Board of Directors of Company of this Agreement and/or
the Merger to Companys stockholders, (ii) take any public action or make any
public statement in connection with the meeting of Company stockholder to be
held pursuant to Section 6.3 substantively inconsistent with such
recommendation or (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve
or recommend, or fail to recommend against, any Alternative Proposal (any of
the actions described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of
Company may make a Change of Recommendation, if, and only if, each of the
following conditions is satisfied:

 

  (i) it receives an Alternative Proposal not solicited in breach of this
Section 6.10 that constitutes a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal
has not been withdrawn;

 

  (ii) it determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel), that in light of a Superior Proposal the failure to effect such
Change of Recommendation would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties to
Company stockholders under applicable law;

 

  (iii) Parent has received written notice from Company (a " _Change of_
_Recommendation Notice_ ") at least three business days prior to such Change
of Recommendation, which notice shall (1) state expressly that Company has
received an Alternative Proposal which the Board of Directors of Company has
determined is a Superior Proposal and that Company intends to effect a Change
of Recommendation and the manner in which it intends or may intend to do so
and (2) include the identity of the person making such Alternative Proposal
and a copy (if in writing) and summary of material terms of such Alternative
Proposal;  _provided_ that any material amendment to the terms of such
Alternative Proposal shall require a new Change of Recommendation Notice and
at least two business days prior to such Change of Recommendation; and

 

  (iv) during any such notice period, Company and its advisors have
negotiated in good faith with Parent (provided that Parent desires to
negotiate) to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
such that such Alternative Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal.

 

  As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any proposal
made by a third party (A) to acquire, directly or indirectly, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, 100% of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock or 100% of the assets, net revenues or net
income of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (B) which is

   otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of Company determines in its
reasonable good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel), taking into account, among other things, all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person
making the proposal, that the proposal, (i) if consummated would result in a
transaction that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to
Companys stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, including to the
extent required, financing which is then committed or which, in the
good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Company, is reasonably
capable of being obtained by such third party.

 

  (e) Company shall ensure that the officers, directors and all
employees, agents and representatives (including any investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other representatives) of
Company or its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in this
Section 6.10 as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is
understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
6.10 by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including
any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other

    _W I T N E S S E T H_ : 
--- 

 

 WHEREAS, Grantee and Issuer have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), which agreement has been executed by the parties hereto in connection with this Stock Option Agreement (the " _Agreement_ "); and

 

 WHEREAS, as a condition to Grantees entering into the Merger Agreement and in consideration therefor, Issuer has agreed to grant Grantee the Option (as hereinafter defined);

 

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

 1\. (a) Issuer hereby grants to Grantee an unconditional, irrevocable option (the " _Option_ ") to purchase, subject to the terms hereof, up to 304,421,097 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Issuers Common Stock, par value $1.33 1/3 per share (" _Common_ _Stock_ "), at a price of $17.05 per share (the " _Option Price_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Option is exercisable exceed 19.9% of the Issuers issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock without giving effect to any shares subject to or issued pursuant to the Option. The number of shares of Common Stock that may be received upon the exercise of the Option and the Option Price are subject to adjustment as herein set forth.

 

 (b) In the event that any additional shares of Common Stock are either (i) issued or otherwise become outstanding after the date of this Agreement (other than pursuant to this Agreement) or (ii) redeemed, repurchased, retired or otherwise cease to be outstanding after the date of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option shall be increased or decreased, as appropriate, so that, after such issuance, such number equals 19.9% of the number of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding without giving effect to any shares subject or issued pursuant to the Option. Nothing contained in this Section 1(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to authorize Issuer or Grantee to breach any provision of the Merger Agreement.

 

 2\. (a) The Holder (as hereinafter defined) may exercise the Option, in whole or part, and from time to time, if, but only if, both an Initial Triggering Event (as 

  hereinafter defined) and a Subsequent Triggering Event (as hereinafter
defined) shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an Exercise
Termination Event (as hereinafter defined), _provided_ that the Holder shall
have sent the written notice of such exercise (as provided in subsection (e)
of this Section 2) within 180 days following such Subsequent Triggering Event.
Each of the following shall be an "Exercise Termination Event": (i) the
Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Merger; (ii)
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the provisions thereof
if such termination occurs prior to the occurrence of an Initial Triggering
Event except a termination by Grantee pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (unless the
breach by Issuer giving rise to such right of termination is non-volitional)
or Section 8.1(e) of the Merger Agreement; or (iii) the passage of 18 months
after termination of the Merger Agreement if such termination follows the
occurrence of an Initial Triggering Event or is a termination by Grantee
pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (unless the breach by Issuer giving rise to such
right of termination is non-volitional) or Section 8.1(e) of the Merger
Agreement. The term "Holder" shall mean the holder or holders of the Option.

 

 (b) The term " _Initial Triggering Event_ " shall mean any of the following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof:

 

 (i) Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries (each an " _Issuer Subsidiary_ "), without having received Grantees prior written consent, shall have entered into an agreement to engage in an Acquisition Transaction (as hereinafter defined) with any person (the term " _person_ " for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _1934 Act_ "), and the rules and regulations thereunder) other than Grantee or any of its Subsidiaries (each a " _Grantee Subsidiary_ ") or the Board of Directors of Issuer shall have recommended that the stockholders of Issuer approve or accept any Acquisition Transaction with any person other than Grantee or a Subsidiary of Grantee. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Transaction_ " shall mean (w) a merger, consolidation or share exchange, or any similar transaction, involving Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")) of Issuer, (x) a purchase, lease or other acquisition or assumption of all or a substantial portion of the assets or deposits of Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of Issuer, (y) a purchase or other acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of securities representing 10% or more of the voting power of Issuer ( _provided_ that this clause (y) shall not be triggered as a result of Temasek Capital (Private) Limited or its subsidiaries acquiring beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock solely as a result of their holdings of Common Stock as of the date hereof taken together with their acquisition of additional shares of Common Stock under their existing agreement to purchase Common Stock entered into with Issuer on July 28, 2008), or (z) any substantially similar transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any merger, consolidation, purchase or similar transaction involving only the Issuer and one or more of its Subsidiaries or involving only any two or more of such Subsidiaries, be deemed to be an Acquisition Transaction, _provided_ that any such transaction is not entered into in violation of the terms of the Merger Agreement;

  (ii) Any event set forth in Section 8.1(e) of the Merger Agreement shall have occurred;

 

 (iii) Any person other than Grantee, any Grantee Subsidiary or any Issuer Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity in the ordinary course of its business shall have acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the term " _beneficial ownership_ " for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder); _provided_ that this clause (iii) shall not be triggered as a result of Temasek Capital (Private) Limited or its subsidiaries acquiring beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock solely as a result of their holdings of Common Stock as of the date hereof taken together with their acquisition of additional shares of Common Stock under their existing agreement to purchase Common Stock entered into with Issuer on July 28, 2008;

 

 (iv) Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary shall have made a _bona fide_ proposal to Issuer or its stockholders that is public or becomes the subject of public disclosure to engage in an Acquisition Transaction;

 

 (v) After the receipt by Issuer or its stockholders of any _bona fide_ inquiry or proposal (or the _bona fide_ indication of any intention to propose) from a third party to engage in an Acquisition Transaction, Issuer shall have breached any covenant or obligation contained in the Merger Agreement and such breach (x) would entitle Grantee to terminate the Merger Agreement and (y) shall not have been cured prior to the Notice Date (as defined below); or 

 

 (vi) Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary, other than in connection with a transaction to which Grantee has given its prior written consent, shall have filed an application or notice with the Federal Reserve Board, or other federal or state bank regulatory authority, which application or notice has been accepted for processing, for approval to engage in an Acquisition Transaction.

 

 (c) The term " _Subsequent Triggering Event_ " shall mean either of the following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof:

 

 (i) The acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the then outstanding Common Stock; or

 

 (ii) The occurrence of the Initial Triggering Event described in paragraph (i) of subsection (b) of this Section 2, except that the percentage referred to in clause (y) shall be 20%.

  (d) Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of any Initial Triggering Event or Subsequent Triggering Event of which it has knowledge, it being understood that the giving of such notice by Issuer shall not be a condition to the right of the Holder to exercise the Option.

 

 (e) In the event the Holder is entitled to and wishes to exercise the Option, it shall send to Issuer a written notice (the date of which being herein referred to as the " _Notice_ _Date_ ") specifying (i) the total number of shares it will purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a place and date not earlier than three business days nor later than 60 business days from the Notice Date for the closing of such purchase (the " _Closing Date_ "); _provided_ that if prior notification to or approval of the Federal Reserve Board or any other regulatory agency is required in connection with such purchase, the Holder shall as soon as reasonably practicable file the required notice or application for approval and shall expeditiously process the same and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which any required notification periods have expired or been terminated or such approvals have been obtained and any requisite waiting period or periods shall have passed. Any exercise of the Option shall be deemed to occur on the Notice Date relating thereto.

 

 (f) At the closing referred to in subsection (e) of this Section 2, the Holder shall pay to Issuer the aggregate purchase price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer, _provided_ that failure or refusal of Issuer to designate such a bank account shall not preclude the Holder from exercising the Option.

 

 (g) At such closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available funds as provided in subsection (f) of this Section 2, Issuer shall deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock purchased by the Holder and, if the Option should be exercised in part only, a new Option evidencing the rights of the Holder thereof to purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder, and the Holder shall deliver to Issuer this Agreement and a letter agreeing that the Holder will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such shares in violation of applicable law or the provisions of this Agreement.

 

 (h) Certificates for Common Stock delivered at a closing hereunder may be endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read substantially as follows:

 

"The transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject to
certain provisions of an agreement between the registered holder hereof and
Issuer and to resale restrictions arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. A copy of such agreement is on file at the principal office of Issuer
and will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon receipt by
Issuer of a written request therefor."

 

 It is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _1933 Act_ "), in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the Holder shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel, in form and 

  substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer, to the effect that such legend is
not required for purposes of the 1933 Act; (ii) the reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in the above legend shall be removed by delivery
of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have been
sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and
under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference; and
(iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the conditions in the
preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. In addition, such
certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by law.

 

 (i) Upon the giving by the Holder to Issuer of the written notice of exercise of the Option provided for under subsection (e) of this Section 2 and the tender of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of Issuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to the Holder. Issuer shall pay all expenses, and any and all United States federal, state and local taxes and other charges that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issuance and delivery of stock certificates under this Section 2 in the name of the Holder or its assignee, transferee or designee.

 

 3\. Issuer agrees: (i) that it shall at all times maintain, free from preemptive rights, sufficient authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock so that the Option may be exercised without additional authorization of Common Stock after giving effect to all other options, warrants, convertible securities and other rights to purchase Common Stock; (ii) that it will not, by charter amendment or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution or sale of assets, or by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the covenants, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by Issuer; (iii) promptly to take all action as may from time to time be required (including (x) complying with all premerger notification, reporting and waiting period requirements specified in 15 U.S.C. § 18a and regulations promulgated thereunder and (y) in the event, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHCA_ "), or the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, or any state banking law, prior approval of or notice to the Federal Reserve Board or to any state or other regulatory authority is necessary before the Option may be exercised, cooperating fully with the Holder in preparing such applications or notices and providing such information to the Federal Reserve Board or such other regulatory authority as they may require) in order to permit the Holder to exercise the Option and Issuer duly and effectively to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant hereto; and (iv) promptly to take all action provided herein to protect the rights of the Holder against dilution.

 

 4\. This Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of the Holder, upon presentation and surrender of this Agreement at the principal office of Issuer, for other Agreements providing for Options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth herein, in the aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder. The terms " _Agreement_ " and " _Option_ " as used herein include any Stock Option Agreements and related Options for which this Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) may be exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of 

  this Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new Agreement
of like tenor and date. Any such new Agreement executed and delivered shall
constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part of Issuer, whether
or not the Agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time
be enforceable by anyone.

 

 5\. In addition to the adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock that are purchasable upon exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Option and the Option Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 5. In the event of any change in, or distributions in respect of, the Common Stock by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, mergers, recapitalizations, combinations, subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of shares, distributions on or in respect of the Common Stock that would be prohibited under the terms of the Merger Agreement, or the like, the type and number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise hereof and the Option Price shall be appropriately adjusted in such manner as shall fully preserve the economic benefits provided hereunder and proper provision shall be made in any agreement governing any such transaction to provide for such proper adjustment and the full satisfaction of the Issuers obligations hereunder. 

 

 6\. Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent Triggering Event that occurs prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall, at the request of Grantee delivered within 180 days of such Subsequent Triggering Event (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any subsequent holder of this Option (or part thereof) or any of the shares of Common Stock issued pursuant hereto), promptly prepare, file and keep current a shelf registration statement under the 1933 Act covering this Option and any shares issued and issuable pursuant to this Option and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and remain current in order to permit the sale or other disposition of this Option and any shares of Common Stock issued upon total or partial exercise of this Option (" _Option Shares_ ") in accordance with any plan of disposition requested by Grantee. Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective or such shorter time as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. Grantee shall have the right to demand two such registrations. The foregoing notwithstanding, if, at the time of any request by Grantee for registration of the Option or Option Shares as provided above, Issuer is in registration with respect to an underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock, and if in the good faith judgment of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, or, if none, the sole underwriter or underwriters, of such offering the inclusion of the Holders Option or Option Shares would interfere with the successful marketing of the shares of Common Stock offered by Issuer, the number of Option Shares otherwise to be covered in the registration statement contemplated hereby may be reduced; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such required reduction the number of Option Shares to be included in such offering for the account of the Holder shall constitute at least 25% of the total number of shares to be sold by the Holder and Issuer in the aggregate; and _provided further_ , _however_ , that if such reduction occurs, then the Issuer shall file a registration statement for the balance as promptly as practicable and no reduction shall thereafter occur. Each such Holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by Issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. If requested by any such Holder in connection with such registration, Issuer shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating 

  itself in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other
agreements customarily included in secondary offering underwriting agreements
for the Issuer. Upon receiving any request under this Section 6 from any
Holder, Issuer agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to
Issuer to be entitled to registration rights under this Section 6, in each
case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record
of the persons entitled to receive such copies. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, in no event shall Issuer be obligated to effect
more than two registrations pursuant to this Section 6 by reason of the fact
that there shall be more than one Grantee as a result of any assignment or
division of this Agreement.

 

 7\. (a) Immediately prior to, or after, the occurrence of a Repurchase Event (as defined below), (i) following a request of the Holder, delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer (or any successor thereto) shall repurchase the Option from the Holder immediately prior to the Repurchase Event (or, as requested by the Holder, after the Repurchase Event) at a price (the " _Option Repurchase Price_ ") equal to the product of the number of shares for which this Option may then be exercised multiplied by the amount by which (A) the Market/Offer Price (as defined below) exceeds (B) the Option Price, and (ii) at the request of the owner of Option Shares from time to time (the " _Owner_ "), delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event and within 90 days of the occurrence of a Repurchase Event (or such later period as provided in Section 10), Issuer shall repurchase such number of the Option Shares from the Owner as the Owner shall designate at a price (the " _Option Share Repurchase Price_ ") equal to the Market/Offer Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares so designated. The term " _Market/Offer Price_ " shall mean the highest of (i) the price per share of Common Stock at which a tender offer or exchange offer therefor has been made, (ii) the price per share of Common Stock to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with Issuer, (iii) the highest closing price for shares of Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of this Option or the Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of Option Shares, as the case may be, or (iv) in the event of a sale of all or a substantial portion of Issuers assets, the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of Issuer as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer, divided by the number of shares of Common Stock of Issuer outstanding at the time of such sale. In determining the Market/Offer Price, the value of consideration other than cash shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer.

 

 (b) The Holder and the Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its right to require Issuer to repurchase the Option and any Option Shares pursuant to this Section 7 by surrendering for such purpose to Issuer, at its principal office, this Agreement or certificates for Option Shares, as applicable, accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, elects to require Issuer to repurchase this Option and/or the Option Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7. Within the latter to occur of (x) five business days after the surrender of the Option and/or certificates representing Option Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto and (y) the time that is immediately prior to the occurrence of a Repurchase Event, Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Holder the Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Owner the Option Share 

  Repurchase Price therefor or the portion thereof, if any, that Issuer is not
then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering.

 

 (c) To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the Option and/or the Option Shares in full, Issuer shall immediately so notify the Holder and/or the Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, that it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days after the date on which Issuer is no longer so prohibited; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 7 is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from delivering to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in full (and Issuer hereby undertakes to use its best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices, in each case as promptly as practicable in order to accomplish such repurchase), the Holder or Owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares either in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, that portion of the Option Repurchase Price or the Option Share Repurchase Price that Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the Holder, a new Stock Option Agreement evidencing the right of the Holder to purchase that number of shares of Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock for which the surrendered Stock Option Agreement was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the Holder and the denominator of which is the Option Repurchase Price, or (B) to the Owner, a certificate for the Option Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing.

 

 (d) For purposes of this Section 7, a " _Repurchase Event_ " shall be deemed to have occurred (i) upon the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction with respect to Issuer (and not solely involving one or more subsidiaries of Issuer) (except that the percentage referred to in clause (y) of the definition thereof shall be 50%) or (ii) upon the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock.

 

 8\. [Intentionally Omitted]

 

 9\. [Intentionally Omitted]

 

 10\. The 90-day or 180-day periods for exercise of certain rights under Sections 2, 6, 7 and 13 shall be extended: (i) to the extent necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals for the exercise of such rights and for the expiration of all statutory waiting periods; and (ii) to the extent necessary to avoid liability under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act by reason of such exercise.

 

 11\. Issuer hereby represents and warrants to Grantee as follows:

 

 (a) Issuer has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and 

  delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of
Directors of Issuer and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Issuer
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions so
contemplated. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by Issuer.

 

 (b) Issuer has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve and to permit it to issue, and at all times from the date hereof through the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms will have reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the Option, that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock at any time and from time to time issuable hereunder, and all such shares, upon issuance pursuant hereto, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable, and will be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrance and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights.

 

 (c) The Board of Directors of Issuer has unanimously approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including by reserving shares for issuance of shares of Common Stock on exercise of the Option) and taken any other action as required to render inapplicable to such agreement and transactions Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and, to the knowledge of Issuer, any similar Takeover Statutes.

 

 12\. Grantee hereby represents and warrants to Issuer that:

 

 (a) Grantee has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to any approvals or consents referred to herein, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Grantee. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Grantee.

 

 (b) The Option is not being, and any shares of Common Stock or other securities acquired by Grantee upon exercise of the Option will not be, acquired with a view to the public distribution thereof and will not be transferred or otherwise disposed of except in a transaction registered or exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. 

 

 13\. Neither of the parties hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or the Option created hereunder to any other person, without the express written consent of the other party, except that in the event a Subsequent Triggering Event shall have occurred prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Grantee, subject to the express provisions hereof, may assign in whole or in part its rights and obligations hereunder within 180 days following such Subsequent Triggering Event (or such later period as provided in Section 10); _provided_ , _however_ , that until the date 15 days following the date on which the Federal Reserve Board approves an application by Grantee under the BHCA to acquire the shares of Common Stock subject to the Option, Grantee may not assign its rights under the Option except in (i) a widely dispersed public distribution, (ii) a private placement in which no one party acquires the right to purchase in excess of 2% of the voting shares of Issuer, (iii) an assignment to a single party ( _e.g._ , a broker or investment banker) for the purpose of conducting a widely dispersed 

  public distribution on Grantees behalf, or (iv) any other manner approved by
the Federal Reserve Board.

 

 14\. Each of Grantee and Issuer will use its best efforts to make all filings with, and to obtain consents of, all third parties and governmental authorities necessary to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation making application to list the shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder on the New York Stock Exchange upon official notice of issuance and applying to the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA for approval to acquire the shares issuable hereunder, but Grantee shall not be obligated to apply to state banking authorities for approval to acquire the shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder until such time, if ever, as it deems appropriate to do so.

 

 15\. [Intentionally Omitted] 

 

 16\. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall the Grantees Total Profit (as hereinafter defined) exceed $2 billion and, if it otherwise would exceed such amount, the Grantee, at its sole election, shall either (i) reduce the number of shares of Common Stock subject to this Option, (ii) deliver to Issuer for cancellation Option Shares previously purchased by Grantee, (iii) pay cash to Issuer, or (iv) any combination thereof, so that Grantees actually realized Total Profit shall not exceed $2 billion after taking into account the foregoing actions.

 

 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Option may not be exercised for a number of shares as would result in a Notional Total Profit (as defined below) of more than $2 billion.

 

 (c) As used herein, the term " _Total Profit_ " shall mean the aggregate amount (before taxes) of the following: (i) the amount received by Grantee pursuant to Issuers repurchase of the Option (or any portion thereof) pursuant to Section 7, (ii) (x) the amount received by Grantee pursuant to Issuers repurchase of Option Shares pursuant to Section 7, less (y) the Grantees purchase price for such Option Shares, (iii) (x) the net cash amounts received by Grantee pursuant to the sale of Option Shares (or any other securities into which such Option Shares are converted or exchanged) to any unaffiliated party, less (y) the Grantees purchase price of such Option Shares, (iv) any amounts received by Grantee on the transfer of the Option (or any portion thereof) to any unaffiliated party, and (v) any amount equivalent to the foregoing with respect to the Substitute Option.

 

 (d) As used herein, the term " _Notional Total Profit_ " with respect to any number of shares as to which Grantee may propose to exercise this Option shall be the Total Profit determined as of the date of such proposed exercise assuming that this Option were exercised on such date for such number of shares and assuming that such shares, together with all other Option Shares held by Grantee and its affiliates as of such date, were sold for cash at the closing market price for the Common Stock as of the close of business on the preceding trading day (less customary brokerage commissions).

 

 17\. The parties hereto acknowledge that damages would be an inadequate remedy for a breach of this Agreement by either party hereto and that the obligations of the 

  parties hereto shall be enforceable by either party hereto through injunctive
or other equitable relief.

 

 18\. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions and covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines that the Holder is not permitted to acquire, or Issuer is not permitted to repurchase pursuant to Section 7, the full number of shares of Common Stock provided in Section 1(a) hereof (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1(b) or 5 hereof), it is the express intention of Issuer to allow the Holder to acquire or to require Issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be permissible, without any amendment or modification hereof.

 

 19\. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person, by cable, telegram, telecopy or telex, or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) at the respective addresses of the parties set forth in the Merger Agreement.

 

 20\. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof (except to the extent that mandatory provisions of federal or state law apply).

 

 21\. This Agreement may be executed in two counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

 22\. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of the parties hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, investment bankers, accountants and counsel.

 

 23\. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the Merger Agreement, this Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder and supersedes all prior arrangements or understandings with respect thereof, written or oral. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party, other than the parties hereto, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided herein.

 

 24\. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement.
