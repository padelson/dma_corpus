AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of September 3, 2009, among Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd., a company formed under the laws of Japan (" _Parent_ "), Aptiom, Inc., a Delaware corporation and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Sepracor Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto. 

  

    
Recitals 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS, in furtherance of the Transactions, (a) Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the issued and outstanding shares of the Company\'s common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), and the associated preferred stock purchase rights (the " _Rights_ ", and together with the shares of Company Common Stock, each a " _Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ "), at a price per Share of $23.00 net to the seller in cash (such amount, or any higher amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and (b) the Company has granted to Merger Sub the Top-Up Option and the Majority Protection Option; 

  

 WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). Each Share that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer, other than certain Shares as provided in Section 2.5(b) and Section 2.6, will thereupon be cancelled and converted in the Merger into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement, the Company\'s Board of Directors has approved, and the Company and the Rights Agent have entered into, the Rights Amendment. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE 1. 

THE OFFER 

  

 Section 1.1 _ The Offer._ 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than seven (7) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence the Offer, within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, to purchase any and all outstanding Shares at a price equal to the Offer Price. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, purchase, accept for payment, and pay for, Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Annex A (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). 

        

 (b) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Exchange Act Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2) (the initial " _Expiration Date_ ," and any expiration time and date established pursuant to an authorized extension of the Offer as so extended, also an " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on the initial Expiration Date or any subsequent Expiration Date, all of the Offer Conditions have not been satisfied or waived, then Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, subject to the rights of the parties under Article 8, extend (and re-extend) the Offer and its Expiration Date beyond the initial Expiration Date or such subsequent Expiration Date; _provided_ that any such extension shall be in increments determined by Merger Sub of not more than ten (10) Business Days. The Offer may not be terminated prior to its Expiration Date (as such Expiration Date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this Agreement), unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Article 8\. In no event shall Merger Sub extend the Offer beyond the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Walk Away Date without the prior written consent of the Company in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the rights of the parties under Article 8, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to extend the Offer, for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required by any other Law. 

   

 (c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, comply with the obligations respecting prompt payment and announcement under the Exchange Act, and, without limiting the foregoing, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable following the later of: (i) the earliest date as of which Merger Sub is permitted under applicable Law to accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer and (ii) the earliest date as of which each of the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or waived. 

   

 (d) Merger Sub may, in its discretion, elect to provide for a subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act (each a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") following the Acceptance Time if (i) Merger Sub shall have complied with all of the conditions of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act and (ii) at the commencement of any Subsequent Offering Period (or extension thereof) the number of Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries (including any Shares beneficially owned by any of the foregoing, including all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn at the Acceptance Time) represent less than 90% of the then outstanding number of Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Merger Sub is required to exercise the Top-Up Option pursuant to Section 1.4(c), Merger Sub shall not be permitted to provide for a Subsequent Offering Period.

matter of law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their Affiliates take any action prior to the Effective Time to remove any

The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries collectively hold or acquire at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock after giving effect to the closing of the Offer and, if applicable, the purchase by Merger Sub of the Top-Up Shares, Parent and the Company hereby agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective, without a meeting of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as promptly as practicable.

 Section 2.4 _ Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Merger Sub capital stock, each share of Merger Sub capital stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

        

 Section 2.5 _ Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of Shares the following shall occur: 

  

 (a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.5(b) and (ii) any Appraisal Shares) shall at the Effective Time be canceled and converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate previously representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.7, without interest. 

  

 (b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled automatically and retired and shall cease to exist and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 2.6 _ Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.5(a), but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 (and at the Effective Time, such Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.5(a). The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in, and following the Acceptance Time to direct, all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion of the Merger Consideration provided to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.7(a) to pay for Shares that are instead paid fair value in an appraisal proceeding pursuant to Section 262 shall be returned to Parent upon demand. 

   

 Section 2.7 _ Exchange of Certificates._ 

  

 (a) _ Exchange Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with Computershare Trust Company N.A., the Company\'s transfer agent on the date of this Agreement, or another bank or trust company selected by Parent and approved in advance by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), which shall provide for the payment of Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Article 2\. Parent shall, or shall take all 

        
  

steps necessary to enable and cause Merger Sub to, deposit with the Exchange
Agent at or prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment by
the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Article 2, the cash in U.S. dollars
necessary to pay for the Shares converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall, pending its
disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed
by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investor Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank which are then publicly available); _provided further_
, _however_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable
to holders of Shares following the Effective Time and Parent shall take
all actions necessary to ensure that the Exchange Fund includes at all times
cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to satisfy Parent\'s obligation under this
Article 2\. Any interest or income produced (net of any loss) by such amounts
on deposit with the Exchange Agent will be payable to Parent or as Parent
otherwise directs. In the event of any losses to the Exchange Fund from any
investment such that the Exchange Fund is diminished below the level required
for the Exchange Agent to make prompt cash payments as required under Section
2.7(b), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as
promptly as practicable deposit additional cash into the Exchange Fund to the
extent necessary to reimburse the Exchange Fund for any such investment
losses.

   

 (b) _ Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person who was a holder of record of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, (i) the form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of stock certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated Shares represented by Book-Entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (which transmittal letter shall be in customary form approved by the Company, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be paid promptly in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay to such holder, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at all times from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender in accordance with this Section 2.7 the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2\. 

  

 (c) _ No Further Ownership Rights in Shares._ The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 shall 

        
  

be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Shares previously represented by such Certificates and Book Entry Shares.
From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not permit
any further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 2, except as
otherwise provided by Law.

  

 (d) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter only be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, as general creditors thereof) payment of their claim for Merger Consideration. Any amounts remaining unclaimed immediately prior to such time when such amounts would otherwise escheat or become the property of any Governmental Authority, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (e) _ No Liability._ Except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law. 

  

 (f) _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement.

In the event that the exercise price of any Option is equal to or greater than the Offer Price, such Option shall be cancelled, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have no further force or effect.

To the extent that such amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld and deducted amounts will be paid to the applicable Governmental Authority and treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of Shares, Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and participants in the ESPP as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 2.10 _ Further Action._ If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of this Agreement, the Company and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all such action.

 (b) Section 3.19(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list of all leases, subleases, licenses and other similar agreements under which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries uses or otherwise occupies or has the right or option to use or occupy any real property or interests in real property which are material to the conduct of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, and together with all amendments, modifications, and supplements thereto, the " _Leases_ ," and the real property subject thereto, the " _Leased Real Property_ "). Section 3.19(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter also sets forth the parties to and date of each Lease, and the address and primary use of each Leased Real Property. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has leased or otherwise granted to any Person (other than the Company or a Company Subsidiary) any right to occupy or possess any part of the Real Property. The Company has made available to Parent or its designee true, correct and complete copies of the Leases as in effect on the date hereof. The Leased Real Property and the Owned Real Property are hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Real Property_ ". 

  

 (c) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries has good, valid and marketable fee simple title to the Owned Real Property and valid leasehold or sublease interests or other comparable contract rights in or relating to the Leased Real Property, in each case free and clear of all Liens, title defects, encroachments and other survey defects, except for recorded easements, restrictive covenants, Liens arising under the terms of the applicable Lease and other encumbrances that do not materially detract from the value or use of such Real Property (collectively, the " _Permitted Encumbrances_ "). 

  

 (d) All of the Real Property has such access to, and such use of, gas, electricity and other utility services, as are necessary in the conduct of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as presently conducted, in each case directly or through a valid easement or right of way which is leased or owned by the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances, except where the failure to have any such access, individually or 

        
  

in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

 (e) All buildings, structures, fixtures, building systems and equipment included in the Real Property (the " _Structures_ ") are in good condition and repair and sufficient for the operation of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as presently conducted, except where the failure of the foregoing to be true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (f) Except pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Leases and this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to or obligated under any option, right of first refusal or other contractual right to sell, dispose of or lease any of the Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein to any Person. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement or option to purchase any real property other than the Real Property or interest therein. 

   

 (g) For the purposes of Section 3.19(c), (d), (e), (f), and (h), a Lease, a Lessor Lease, or an Easement Agreement shall each be deemed to include any such agreement entered into after the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time that would have been a Lease, a Lessor Lease, or an Easement Agreement, respectively, had it been in effect as of or prior to the date hereof. 

  

 (h) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Owned Real Property is in compliance in all respects with all applicable Laws, including all applicable zoning laws, ordinances and regulations and with all restrictions of record or other agreements affecting such Owned Real Property. To the Company\'s Knowledge, as of the date hereof, there exists no conflict or dispute with any regulatory authority or other Person relating to any Real Property or the activities thereon, which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (i) As of the date hereof, the Company has not received any written notices regarding any pending, threatened or contemplated condemnation proceeding affecting the Real Property or any part thereof or of any sale or other disposition of the Real Property or any part thereof in lieu of condemnation or other matters materially affecting and impairing the current use, occupancy, or value thereof. 

  

 Section 3.20 _ Inventory, etc._ The inventory of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries consists of raw materials and supplies, goods in process, and finished goods, all of which are fit for their respective intended uses and are not obsolete, damaged, adulterated, misbranded or defective and, in the case of finished goods, are of a quantity and quality useable and salable in the Ordinary Course of Business, except where the failure of the foregoing to be true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 Section 3.21 _ Rights Plan._ The Company Board has approved, and the Company and the Rights Agent have entered into, an amendment to the Rights Agreement in the form heretofore made available to Parent or its designee (the " _Rights Amendment_ "). Pursuant to the Rights Amendment, (A) the Offer is acknowledged to be a Permitted Offer (as defined in the Rights Agreement) and (B) neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions will result in (i) Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates (including Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.) becoming an Acquiring Person or (ii) the occurrence of (A) a Distribution Date, (B) the Stock Acquisition Date, (C) a Section 11(a)(ii) Event or (D) a Section 13 Event, in each case as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement. 

        

 Section 3.22 _ Antitakeover Statute._ Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in Section 4.7, neither Section 203 of the DGCL nor any takeover related provision in the Company Certificate or Company By-laws, would (a) prohibit or restrict the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the Certificate of Merger or its ability to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, (b) have the effect of invalidating or voiding this Agreement or the Certificate of Merger, or any provision hereof or thereof, or (c) subject Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates (including Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.) to any impediment or condition in connection with the initiation or consummation of the Offer, the exercise of any of its rights under this Agreement, or the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in Section 4.7, the approval by the Company Board of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions constitutes approval thereof for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL and represents the only action necessary to ensure that Section 203 of the DGCL does not and will not apply to the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, including the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions.

to cause the Proxy Statement as so amended or supplemented to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. The Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and all
required amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of
Shares as promptly as reasonably practicable after filing the Proxy Statement

 (b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Shares is required by Law, the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall as soon as reasonably practicable following the Acceptance Time duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Required Company Stockholder Vote. The Company Board (i) shall recommend adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Voting Proposal_ ") by the stockholders of the Company and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (ii) shall not withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Company Board that the Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of the Company Voting Proposal. The Company shall take all action that is both reasonable and lawful to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Required Company Stockholder Vote and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the stockholders of the Company required by the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC or the DGCL to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company\'s stockholders. 

  

 (c) At the Company Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall cause all Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer and all other Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any subsidiary of Parent, and shall use its best efforts to cause any shares beneficially owned by any non-controlled Affiliate of Parent, to be present so as to be counted for quorum purposes and voted in favor of the Company Voting Proposal. 

  

 Section 6.2 _ Employee Benefits Matters._ 

  

 (a) During the period commencing on the date of the Acceptance Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent will provide, or cause to be provided, to each Company Employee (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate, and total annual cash incentive opportunity, which is at least equal to such Company Employee\'s base salary or hourly wage rate and total annual cash 

        
  

incentive opportunity (including targeted cash bonuses) immediately before
the Acceptance Time, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in employee
benefit plans, programs and policies (including severance plans) which
provide benefits that are at least comparable in the aggregate to the benefits
provided to such Company Employee under the employee benefit plans, programs
and policies sponsored or maintained by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries immediately before the Acceptance Time; _provided_ , that (A)
Parent shall not be required to, or to cause to be provided to, retain,
implement or provide any plans or arrangements providing for the issuance of
equity or equity-based compensation, and (B) no such plans or arrangements of
the Company referred to in the immediately preceding clause (A) shall be taken
into account in determining whether the Surviving Corporation\'s benefits
are comparable in the aggregate to the benefit provided to employees under
the employee benefit plans sponsored by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries immediately before the Acceptance Time. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Company Employee_ " means any person who is an employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Acceptance Time.

  

 (b) Parent will grant, or will cause to be granted, full credit to each Company Employee for (i) his or her employment with the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Acceptance Time for purposes of satisfying any service requirement to participate in any employee benefit plan, program or policy of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Company or any Subsidiary thereof), vesting in any benefit under any such plan, program or policy and for calculating his or her level of benefits with respect to severance, vacations, personal days off and any other welfare-type benefits where service is a factor in calculating the level of benefits, and (ii) any payments made by such Company Employee or any of his or her dependents under any Employee Benefit Plan for the plan year for such plan which includes the Acceptance Time for which he or she was eligible to receive credit under such plan towards satisfying any applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements; _provided_ , that no service will be recognized (i) for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries, (ii) for eligibility purposes under any post-retirement welfare benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries or (iii) to the extent such credit would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service. 

  

 (c) Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any employee benefit plan, program or policy of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Company or any Subsidiary thereof) not to impose any pre-existing conditions, exclusions, waiting periods or "actively at work" requirements with respect to any Company Employee, except to the extent such requirements would have been imposed under the Employee Benefit Plans and have not already been satisfied. 

  

 (d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to the Company Employees bonus payments in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of the Company\'s 2009 bonus plan, as set forth in Section 6.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter. In addition, if any Company Employee is terminated without cause, as defined in Section 6.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, after the Acceptance Time but prior to receipt of his or her bonus pursuant to the prior sentence, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay such Company Employee his or her target bonus under the 2009 bonus plan, pro rated for the portion of the 2009 fiscal year that such Company Employee was employed by the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries and determined consistent with the Company\'s consolidated performance during such period of 2009 that such Company Employee was employed by the Company and the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) Parent will honor, or cause to be honored, any and all obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that are in effect both on the date hereof and immediately prior to the Acceptance Time in respect of post-retirement benefits, but only with respect to the persons and benefits listed on Section 6.2(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

       

                                      
(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall modify or amend any Employee Benefit
Plan of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or other agreement, plan,
program, or document unless this Agreement explicitly states that the
provision "amends" such Employee Benefit Plan of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or other agreement, plan, program, or document. Nothing in
this Section 6.2 shall obligate Parent to, or to cause the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary or any of its other Affiliates to,
employ any person for any period of time after the Acceptance Time, and this
Section 6.2 shall not be construed to limit the ability of Parent to alter the
terms and conditions of, or terminate, the employment of any person (other
than as provided expressly in this Section 6.2). Without limiting the
generality of Section 9.7(b), nothing in this Section 6.2 shall be construed
as giving any Person (including any Company Employee or dependent or
beneficiary thereof) any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Section 6.2.

  

 Section 6.3 _ Antitrust Filings._ 

  

 (a) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall each, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in no event later than seven (7) Business Days after the date hereof), file or cause to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") and any comparable non-United States antitrust or competition authority any notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act or comparable foreign Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions.

 (c) Prior to the Board Appointment Time, the parties will jointly and, following the Board Appointment Time (but subject to the terms of Section 1.3(c)), Parent will, determine strategy, lead all proceedings and coordinate all activities with respect to seeking any actions, consents, approvals or waivers of any Governmental Authority as contemplated hereby, and the parties will each take such actions as reasonably requested by the other parties in connection with obtaining such consents, approvals or waivers. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction. 

  

 (d) The parties agree not to extend directly or indirectly any waiting period under the HSR Act or any applicable non-United States Antitrust Law or enter into any agreement with a Governmental Authority to delay or not to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, except with 

        
  

the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to applicable
legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Authority, each of
Parent and Merger Sub and the Company shall (i) promptly notify the other
party of any written communication to that party from any Governmental
Authority with respect to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and, subject
to applicable Law, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed
written communication to any such Governmental Authority and incorporate the
other party\'s reasonable comments, (ii) not agree to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Authority in
respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend, (iii) furnish the other
party with copies of all material correspondence, filings and written
communications between them and their Affiliates and their respective
representatives on one hand, and any such Governmental Authority or
its staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions and (iv) furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and each other matter as may be required by Law in connection
with every statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any third party and/or Governmental Authority in connection with the Offer,
the Merger or the other Transactions.

The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that they shall consult with each other with respect to the

 (d) Except as set forth in this Section 6.8, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Board Recommendation, or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal (it being understood and agreed that taking a neutral position or failing to take a position, in each case, with respect to any Takeover Proposal that is a tender offer after ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such tender offer shall be considered an adverse modification) (any action described in clause (i) or (ii) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company and/or the Company Board (or any committee thereof), as applicable, may, prior to the Acceptance Time, (A) withdraw, modify or qualify, or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, the Board Recommendation due to the occurrence of an Intervening Event, or (B) in response to an unsolicited written Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a material breach of this Section 6.8 that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company\'s outside counsel and financial advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal, (x) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, such Superior Proposal, or (y) enter into a binding written agreement concerning such Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 8.1(d), including compliance with the requirement to pay or cause to be paid the Termination Fee, and in any such case of clause (A) or (B) only if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with the Company\'s outside counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Company, the Company 

        
  

Board or any committee thereof shall take any action referred to in clause
(A) or (B) of this Section 6.8(d) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(d), unless:

  

  

 (1) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing (a " _Termination Notice_ "), at least four (4) Business Days before taking such action (the " _Recommendation Period_ "), of its intention to do so, and either: (x) in the case of an action described in clause (A) of this Section 6.8(d), attaches to such Termination Notice a description of the Intervening Event describing in reasonable detail the material facts thereof or relating thereto giving rise to such action; or (y) in the case of an action described in clause (B) of this Section 6.8, (1) attaches to the Termination Notice the most current version of the proposed agreement under which the Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated, and (2) sets forth in such Termination Notice the identity of the third party making such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that any material amendment or modification to any such Superior Proposal shall require a new written Termination Notice by the Company, _provided_ that the Recommendation Period in respect of any such new written Termination Notice shall be three (3) Business Days; and 

  

 (2) the Company shall have offered to negotiate in good faith with (and, if accepted, negotiated in good faith with), and shall have instructed its financial and legal advisors to offer to negotiate in good faith with (and, if accepted, negotiated in good faith with), Parent to attempt to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as will enable the Company to proceed with this Agreement in lieu of pursuing such Superior Proposal; and 

  

 (3) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial adviser and outside legal counsel and, after considering the results of such negotiations and the revised proposal made by Parent, if any, that either: (x) in the case of an action described in clause (B) of this Section 6.8(d), the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Company\'s Termination Notice (including any subsequent amendments or modifications thereto) continues to be a Superior Proposal; or (y) in view of the Intervening Event, it would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law to recommend in favor of the Offer and the Merger on the revised terms, if any, proposed by Parent. 

  

  

 (e) Nothing in this Section 6.8 or in Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company\'s stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, or (ii) from making any disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders if in each case under this clause (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or an express rejection of any applicable Takeover Proposal together with an express reaffirmation of its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the Offer and the Merger shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. 

  

 Section 6.9 _ Indemnification and Insurance._ 

  

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to advancement of expenses, indemnification and exculpation by the Company or any Company Subsidiary now existing in favor of each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each, together with such person\'s heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Company\'s or such Company Subsidiary\'s respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger from the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs. 

       

                                     

    

  (b) Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Acceptance
Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and
severally, to the fullest extent that the Surviving Corporation would be
permitted to do so under applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
(and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing, subject to the
indemnifying or advancing party\'s receipt of an unsecured undertaking by or
on behalf of the Indemnified Party to repay such funds if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification
hereunder) each Indemnified Party against any costs or expenses (including
advancing reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
otherwise (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection
with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether
before or after the Acceptance Time in connection with such Indemnified Party
serving as an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any other Person if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

 (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, as of the Effective Time, to cause the individuals who have served as officers and directors of the Company prior to the Effective Time who are then covered by the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy currently maintained by the Company (the " _D andO Insurance_"), to be covered under a prepaid directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to such individuals than the Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions or omissions of such officers and directors at or prior to the Effective Time (including in respect of this Agreement and the Transactions) in their capacities as such, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 250% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Corporation shall procure and maintain for such six-year (6) period as much coverage as is available for the Maximum Amount. Parent shall have the right to cause coverage to be extended under the DandO Insurance by causing the Surviving Corporation to obtain a six (6) year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to such former directors or officers than the DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this Section 6.9(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a so-called "Reporting Tail Endorsement," provided that the Company does not pay more than the amount set forth on Section 6.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter for such Reporting Tail Endorsement, in which case, provided that Parent causes the Surviving Corporation to maintain such Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for its full term, Parent shall be relieved from its other obligations under this Section 6.9(c). 

  

 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9. 

  

 (e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.9 applies without the written consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this 

        
  

Section 6.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.9,
each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9). Parent shall pay
all expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by
any Indemnified Party in connection with their enforcement of their rights
provided in this Section 6.9; _provided_ that such Indemnified
Party prevails in such enforcement action.

  

 Section 6.10 _ Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by Section 2.8 and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act (in accordance with that certain SEC No-Action Letter to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters). 

  

 Section 6.11 _ Convertible Notes._ 

   

 (a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be provided, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the respective indentures (each, an " _Indenture_ ") under which were issued the Convertible Notes due 2010 and the Convertible Notes due 2024 to the trustee under each such Indenture and to each Holder (as defined in each such Indenture), any notices and announcements required by such Indenture to be delivered prior to the Effective Time in connection with the Transactions. 

   

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall, on the Closing Date, execute such supplemental indenture to each Indenture as may be required under such Indenture in connection with the Transactions. 

  

 (c) The Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all such further action as may be necessary to comply with all of the terms and conditions of each Indenture in connection with the Transaction, including (i) delivery of any officers\' certificates and opinions of counsel required by each such Indenture, (ii) conducting any offer required under such Indenture to repurchase Convertible Notes issued thereunder, and (iii) taking any such other actions required in connection with clauses (i) and (ii). 

  

 Section 6.12 _ State Takeover Laws._ The Company and the Company Board shall (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (b) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up Option, the Majority Protection Option or any of the other Transactions, use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up Option, the Majority Protection Option and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions. The Company and the Company Board shall not take any action to approve any Takeover Proposal made by any Person other than Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent for purposes of any state takeover Law or to cause any state takeover Law that would otherwise apply to any such Takeover Proposal to become inapplicable thereto, except to the extent such action is taken immediately prior to or concurrently with the termination of this Agreement by the Company in accordance with Section 8.1(d). 

  

 Section 6.13 _ Financing._ The Company shall, at Parent\'s sole cost and expense, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent in its efforts to consummate the financing of the Transactions. Such commercially reasonable efforts shall include, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent and at Parent\'s sole cost and expense, (a) providing direct contact between prospective lenders and the officers and directors of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, (b) providing assistance in preparation of confidential information memoranda, preliminary offering memoranda, financial information and other materials to be used in connection with obtaining such financing, 

        
  

(c) cooperation with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing
sources for such financing, including participation in management presentation
sessions, "road shows" and sessions with rating agencies, (d) providing
assistance in obtaining any consents of third parties necessary in connection
with such financing, (e) providing assistance in extinguishing
existing Indebtedness of the Company and Company Subsidiaries and releasing
Liens securing such Indebtedness, in each case to take effect at the Effective
Time, (f) cooperation with respect to matters relating to pledges of
collateral to take effect at the Effective Time in connection with such
financing, (g) assisting Parent in obtaining legal opinions to be delivered in
connection with such financing, (h) assisting Parent in securing the
cooperation of the independent accountants of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries, including with respect to the delivery of accountants\' comfort
letters, and (i) providing the financial information necessary for the
satisfaction of the obligations and conditions set forth in the commitment
letter relating to such financing within the time periods required thereby;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to take any such
action to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the business
or operations of the Company or Company Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required, under the provisions of
this Section 6.13 or otherwise in connection with the financing (x) to pay
any commitment or other similar fee prior to the Effective Time that is not
advanced or substantially simultaneously reimbursed by Parent or (y) to incur
any out-of-pocket expense unless such expense is advanced or substantially
simultaneously reimbursed by Parent. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection
with (1) any action taken by them at the request of Parent or Merger Sub
pursuant to this Section 6.13 or in connection with the arrangement of the
financing or (2) any information utilized in connection therewith (other
than information provided by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries).
Nothing contained in this Section 6.13 or otherwise shall require the Company
to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the financing prior to the
Closing. All material, non-public information regarding the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries provided to Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives
pursuant to this Section 6.13 shall be kept confidential by them in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement except for disclosure to
potential lenders as required in connection with the financing subject to
customary confidentiality protections.

  

 Section 6.14 _ Stock Exchange De-listing._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC to enable the de-listing of the common stock of the Surviving Corporation from the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC and the deregistration of such common stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 6.15 _ Control of Operations._ Without in any way limiting any party\'s rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company\'s operations prior to the Board Appointment Date, and (b) prior to the Board Appointment Date, the Company shall exercise, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations. 

  

 Section 6.16 _ Obligations of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation._ Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and, following the Board Appointment Time, the Company, to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.17 _ Rule 14-10(d)._ Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company (acting through its Compensation Committee, composed solely of "independent directors" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) of the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto) shall take all such steps as may be required to cause each employment compensation, severance and employee benefit 

        
  

arrangement entered into by the Company or any Company Subsidiary after the
date of this Agreement with any of its directors or employees pursuant to
which consideration is paid to such director or employee to satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
of the Exchange Act.

 Section 7.2 _ Failure of Conditions._ Neither Parent nor the Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.1 to be satisfied to excuse performance by such party of its obligations hereunder, if such failure was caused by such party\'s failure to act in good faith and in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the Offer. 

  

    
ARTICLE 8. 

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER 

  

 Section 8.1 _ Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer, Merger and other Transactions may be abandoned as follows:

 (b) by either the Company or Parent as follows: 

  

  

 (i) if the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred on or before 5:00 p.m. New York time on January 29, 2010 (the " _Walk Away Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party if the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur on or before the Walk Away Date was caused by or resulted from the failure of such party (or any Affiliate of such party) to perform any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement required to be performed by such party (or any Affiliate of such party); or 

  

 (ii) if any Judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a Governmental Authority, or Law or other legal restraint or prohibition, in each case making the consummation of the Offer or Merger illegal or permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise preventing the consummation thereof shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ that the party seeking the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to resist, lift or resolve such Judgment, Law or other legal restraint or prohibition and the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this 

  

      

  
  

Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available if the issuance of such Judgment,
Law, legal restraint or prohibition was caused by or resulted from the failure
of such party (or any Affiliate of such party) to perform any covenant or
agreement in this Agreement required to be performed by such party (or any
Affiliate of such party); or

  

  

 (c) by Parent, prior to the purchase of any Shares pursuant to the Offer, if there shall have occurred a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; or

 (f) by Parent, prior to the purchase of any Shares pursuant to the Offer, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform, as applicable, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement (other than the covenants and agreements set forth in Section 6.8, in respect of which Section 8.1(e) shall apply), which breach or failure to perform (i) would cause the conditions set forth in clauses 2(b) or 2(c) of Annex A not to be satisfied, and (ii) shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days following receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from Parent, and (y) the Walk Away Date; _provided_ that neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then in material breach of any covenant or agreement under this Agreement; or

  The party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall deliver written
notice of such termination to the other party, setting forth in such notice
the provision of this Section 8.1 pursuant to which such party is terminating
this Agreement.

  

 _ _Section 8.2 _ Effect of Termination._ Upon the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void except for the provisions of (a) this Section 8.2, (b)
Section 8.3 (Fees and Expenses), (c) Article 9 (General Provisions), and (d)
Section 6.13 (but only with respect to Parent\'s reimbursement and
indemnification obligations under such Section 6.13), which shall survive
such termination; provided that, except as otherwise provided in the last
sentence of Section 8.3(c), nothing herein shall relieve any party from
liability for any willful breach of this Agreement. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall not be affected by the termination of this Agreement and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

  

 Section 8.3 _ Fees and Expenses._ 

  

 (a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3 and Section 6.13, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated. 

  

 (b) The Company shall pay Parent: 

  

  

 (i) a termination fee of $77,400,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), in the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d), or (B) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c); or 

   

 (ii) a Termination Fee, in the event that this Agreement is terminated (x) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e), (y) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) at a time when Parent would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), or (z) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f) as a result of a breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement, so long as, in the case of the immediately preceding clauses (x), (y) and (z), (A) before the date of such termination, a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise been publicly communicated to the Company Board or the holders of Company Common Stock and, in each case, not subsequently publicly withdrawn, and (B) within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement for any Takeover Proposal, which Takeover Proposal is ultimately consummated ( _provided_ , that for purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(ii), each reference to "20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%"). 

  

  

 Any Termination Fee due under Section 8.3(b)(i)(A) shall be paid to the Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds concurrently with the termination. Any Termination Fee due under Section 8.3(b)(i)(B) shall be paid to the Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2) Business Days of the date of termination. Any Termination Fee due under Section 8.3(b)(ii) shall be paid to Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2) Business Days after the date on which the applicable Takeover Proposal is consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to pay a Termination Fee pursuant to more than one clause of this Section 8.3(b) or on more than one occasion. 

  

 (c) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its documented and reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in effect on the date such payment was required to be made, plus two percent (2%). Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, 

        
  

notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the terms of the immediately following proviso), if the Termination
Fee is paid to Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i) or Section 8.3(b)(ii)(y),
such payment of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and Merger Sub arising out of or in connection with this Agreement,
the Transactions and such termination; provided that, notwithstanding the
terms in this sentence, Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to assert a
claim that the Company willfully breached Section 6.8 of this Agreement (and,
if such willful breach is determined to have occurred, the payment of the
Termination Fee shall not be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent
and Merger Sub in respect thereof) if (and only if) (i) Parent gives written
notice to the Company in good faith prior to or promptly following the time of
payment of such Termination Fee of Parent\'s belief that the Company
willfully breached Section 6.8 and such willful breach gave rise to
circumstances resulting in such payment of the Termination Fee, if such breach
is then known to Parent, or (ii) Parent alleges that a willful breach of
Section 6.8 of this Agreement gave rise to circumstances resulting in such
payment of the Termination Fee and Parent certifies in writing to the Company
that such breach was not known to Parent at the time of termination of this
Agreement.

  

 _ _Section 8.4 _ Amendment._ Subject to Section 1.3(c),
at any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, at any time before or after adoption of this Agreement and the
Transactions by the respective Boards of Directors or stockholders of the
parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such adoption by
the holders of Shares, no amendment shall be made that, by applicable Law,
requires further approval of such stockholders, without the further approval
of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

   

 _ _Section 8.5 _ Waiver._ Subject to Section 1.1 and Section
1.3(c), at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to
the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or
waiver shall not apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition,
as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the extension or
waiver. Subject to the last sentence of Section 8.3(c), the failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or preclude any other
or further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not modify or extend the duration of any
Recommendation Period pursuant to Section 6.8(d).

  

 _ _Section 8.6 _ Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension
or Waiver._ A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, an
amendment, modification or supplement of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.4 or an extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.5
shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of Merger Sub or the
Company, action by its Board of Directors or the duly authorized designee of
its Board of Directors (which, in the case of the Company, shall include the
approval contemplated by Section 1.3).

Letter, which contains certain disclosures that are not reflected in the text
of this Agreement; and (c) may apply standards of materiality in a way that

 Section 9.10 _ Enforcement._ 

   

 (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and this right shall include the right of the parties to cause the Transactions to be consummated on the terms set forth in this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity or pursuant to this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at Law would be adequate. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the parties\' rights to specific performance or injunctive relief or both pursuant to Section 9.10(a), each party may pursue any other remedy available to it at Law or in equity, including monetary damages; provided, that it is understood and agreed that claims for monetary damages following termination of this Agreement shall be (x) limited to those arising from or relating to any willful breach of this Agreement prior to such termination and (y) subject to the last sentence of Section 8.3(c). If a court has granted an award of damages in connection with any willful breach by Parent and/or Merger Sub of the terms or conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company may, on behalf of its stockholders, enforce such award and accept damages for such breach, and Parent agrees that such damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Company\'s stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and the time value of money). In addition, if a court has granted an award of damages in connection with any willful breach by the Company of the terms or conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company agrees that Parent\'s damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs and that Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to make claims for damages based on the loss of economic benefits of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions that Parent alleges would be realized by Parent, its stockholders or Merger Sub upon the consummation of the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, no party hereto shall be permitted to make any claim or commence any action, suit or proceeding seeking monetary damages against any other party hereto in connection with or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, provided that the foregoing shall be without prejudice to the right of any party to seek such monetary damages following such termination in accordance with, and subject to the limitations set forth in, this Agreement. 

  

 _ _Section 9.11 _ Disclosure Letter._ The inclusion of
any information in the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be
an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is
required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in
or would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect or is outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

Exhibit B 

  

  Form of Amended Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation 

  

 1. The name of the corporation is Sepracor Inc. (the "Corporation"). 

  

 2. The address of its registered office in the State of Delaware is 1209 Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware, 19801. The name of its registered agent at such address is The Corporation Trust Company. 

   

 3. The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"). 

  

 4. The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,000, all of which shall be shares of Common Stock with the par value of $0.01 per share. 

  

 5. The Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws of the Corporation. 

   

 6. Unless and except to the extent that the By-laws of the Corporation (the "By-laws") shall so require, the election of directors of the Corporation need not be by written ballot. 

  

 7. The Corporation expressly elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL. 

  

 8. To the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, as amended from time to time, no director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Any amendment or repeal of the foregoing provision shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment or repeal. 

  

 9. (a) _Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an "Indemnitee"), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9, except as set forth in Section 9(f) below, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. 

   

 (b) _ Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation._ The Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or 

        
  

completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed
to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or
has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer
or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee
benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or
omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys\' fees)
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on
his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal
therefrom, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed
to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except
that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue
or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to
the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of
Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such liability
but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including attorneys\'
fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware or such other court shall deem
proper.

  

 (c) _ Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party._ Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 9, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 9(a) and 9(b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or proceeding, he shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys\' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to the Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, the Indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto. 

   

 (d) _ Notification and Defense of Claim._ As a condition precedent to his right to be indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving him for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such claim, other than as provided below in this Section 9(d). The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel in connection with such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Section 9\. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for the Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above. 

        

 (e) _ Advance of Expenses._ Subject to the provisions of Section 9(f) below, in the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section 9(d) of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this Section 9, any expenses (including attorneys\' fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending a civil or criminal action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter, provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Section 9\. Such undertaking may be accepted without reference to the financial ability of such person to make such repayment. 

  

 (f) _ Procedure for Indemnification._ In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Sections 9(a), 9(b), 9(c) or 9(e), the Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including in such request such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses. Any such indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of the Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under Sections 9(a), 9(b) or 9(e) the Corporation determines, by clear and convincing evidence, within such 60-day period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 9(a) or 9(b), as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance by (a) a majority vote of a quorum of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question ("disinterested directors"), (b) if no such quorum is obtainable, a majority vote of a committee of two or more disinterested directors, (c) a majority vote of a quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of all classes entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class, which quorum shall consist of stockholders who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question, (d) independent legal counsel (who may be regular legal counsel to the Corporation), or (e) a court of competent jurisdiction. 

  

 (g) _ Remedies._ The right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Section 9 shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the 60-day period referred to above in Section 9(f). Unless otherwise provided by law, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 9 shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant to Section 9(f) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The Indemnitee\'s expenses (including attorneys\' fees) incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. 

   

 (h) _ Subsequent Amendment._ No amendment, termination or repeal of this Section 9 or of the relevant provisions of the DGCL or any other applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal. 

  

 (i) _ Other Rights._ The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Section 9 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of 

        
  

stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
his official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding
office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the
estate, heirs, executors and administrators of the Indemnitee. Nothing
contained in this Section 9 shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation
is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and
directors providing indemnification rights and procedures different from
those set forth in this Section 9\. In addition, the Corporation may, to the
extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant
indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or
other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or
greater or less than, those set forth in this Section 9\.

  

 (j) _ Partial Indemnification._ If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Section 9 to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to which the Indemnitee is entitled. 

  

 (k) _ Insurance._ The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. 

  

 (l) _ Merger or Consolidation._ If the Corporation is merged into or consolidated with another corporation and the Corporation is not the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation shall assume the obligations of the Corporation under this Section 9 with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the date of such merger or consolidation. 

  

 (m) _ Savings Clause._ If this Section 9 or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Section 9 that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 

  

 (n) _ Definitions._ Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and Section 145(i) of the DGCL shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145(i). 

   

 (o) _ Subsequent Legislation._ If the DGCL is amended after adoption of this Section 9 to expand further the indemnification permitted to Indemnitees, then the Corporation shall indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. 

  

 10. The Corporation reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, to amend or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, and add other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by applicable law; and all rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (as amended) are granted subject to the rights reserved in this Section.
