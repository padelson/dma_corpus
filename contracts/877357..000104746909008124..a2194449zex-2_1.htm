<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in furtherance of the Transactions, (a)&nbsp;Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under
this Agreement, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Offer</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") to purchase all the issued and outstanding shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company Common Stock</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and the associated preferred stock purchase rights (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Rights</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>", and together
with the shares of Company Common Stock, each a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Share</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" and collectively, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Shares</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), at a price per
Share of $23.00 net to the seller in cash (such amount, or any higher amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Offer
Price</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and (b)&nbsp;the Company has granted to Merger Sub the Top-Up Option and the

be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and this right shall include the right of the
parties to cause the Transactions to be consummated on the terms set forth in this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which

has granted an award of damages in connection with any willful breach by Parent and/or Merger Sub of the terms or conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company may, on behalf of its
stockholders, enforce such award and accept damages for such breach, and Parent agrees that such damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs, and may include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Company's stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and the time value of

to the Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such claim, other than as provided below in this Section&nbsp;9(d). The Indemnitee shall

shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i)&nbsp;the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii)&nbsp;counsel to the Indemnitee shall have

expressly provided by this Section&nbsp;9. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the

the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses. Any such indemnification or advancement of
expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60&nbsp;days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of the Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under
Sections&nbsp;9(a), 9(b) or 9(e) the Corporation determines, by clear and convincing evidence, within such 60-day period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in Sections&nbsp;9(a) or 9(b), as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance by (a)&nbsp;a majority vote of a quorum of the directors of the Corporation
consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question ("disinterested directors"), (b)&nbsp;if no such quorum is obtainable, a majority vote of a
committee of two or more disinterested directors, (c)&nbsp;a majority vote of a quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of all classes entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class,
which quorum shall consist of stockholders who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question, (d)&nbsp;independent legal counsel (who may be regular legal counsel to the
Corporation), or (e)&nbsp;a court of competent jurisdiction. </FONT></P>

by the Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the 60-day period referred
to above in Section&nbsp;9(f). Unless otherwise provided by law, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section&nbsp;9
shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because
the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant to Section&nbsp;9(f) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The Indemnitee's expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in
connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. </FONT></P>
