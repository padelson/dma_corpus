_Milestone Period_ "), provided that if there is an Action taken or Applicable

period from the date of delivery of the draft Milestone Statement until the
date no later than 15 days thereafter, the Purchaser will give the
Shareholder Representative reasonable access to the working papers used to
create the Milestone Statement. If the Shareholder Representative does not
give a notice of objection in accordance with Section 2.9, the Common

which will be final and binding on the Parties.

 

2.7.3 Once the Milestone Payment Statement is finally determined in
accordance with Section 2.7.2 or 2.9, as the case may be, the Purchaser will
pay the Milestone Payment, if any, payable thereunder as promptly as

distribution to Common Shareholders (the " _Milestone Payment Date_ ").

Date with the effect that either (a) Tilray Shares are not available to
satisfy the Milestone Payment, or (b) publicly listed shares of a constituent
party to the Change of Control or successor to Tilray are not available to

During the period from the date of delivery of the draft Closing Statement
until the date no later than 15 days thereafter, the Purchaser will give the
Shareholder Representative reasonable access to the working papers used to
create the draft Closing Statement. If the Shareholder Representative does not
give a notice of objection in accordance with Section 2.9, the Common
Shareholders will be deemed to have accepted the draft Closing Statement which
will be final and binding on the Parties.

 

2.8.3 Once finally determined in accordance with Section 2.8.2 or 2.9, as
the case may be, if (i) the Estimated Arrangement Consideration exceeds the
Final Arrangement Consideration by at least $5,000, then the Common
Shareholders will pay to the Purchaser the amount of the difference between
the Estimated Arrangement Consideration and the Final
Arrangement Consideration on a dollar-for-dollar basis in accordance with the
Plan of Arrangement and (ii) the Final Arrangement Consideration exceeds the
Estimated Arrangement Consideration by at least $5,000, then the Purchaser
will pay each Common Shareholder its Pro Rata Portion of the amount of the
difference between the Final Arrangement Consideration and the Estimated
Arrangement Consideration on a dollar-for-dollar basis in accordance with the
Plan of Arrangement (the adjustment set forth in either (i) or (ii) being the
(" _Closing Date Adjustment_ "). 

2.9 Statement Dispute.

If the Shareholder Representative objects to the draft Milestone Statement or
the draft Closing Statement (each a " _Statement_ ") prepared pursuant to
Section 2.7.2 or 2.8.2, respectively, the Shareholder Representative will give
notice to the Purchaser no later than 30 days after delivery of the draft
Statement. Any notice given by the Shareholder Representative will set out in
detail the particulars of such objection. The Parties will then use reasonable
efforts to resolve such objection for a period of 30 days following the
giving of such notice. If the matter is not resolved by the end of such 30-day
period, then the dispute with respect to such objection will be submitted by
the Parties to an accounting partner associated with an accounting firm of
recognized national standing in Canada, which is independent of the Parties
(the " _Independent Accountant_ "). If the Parties are unable to agree on the
Independent Accountant within a further 15-day period, either Party may apply
to have a court appoint the Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant
will, as promptly as practicable (but in any event within 60 days following
its appointment), make a determination of the contested Statement, based
solely on written submissions of the Parties given by them to the Independent
Accountant. The submissions of each Party will be disclosed to the other Party
and each other Party will be afforded a reasonable opportunity to respond
thereto. The decision of the Independent Accountant as to any Statement will
be final and binding upon the Parties. The Parties will each pay one-half of
the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant with respect to the
resolution of the dispute.

opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order.

A Party must not issue any press release or make any other public statement
or disclosure with respect to this Agreement without the consent of the other
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the
Shareholders shall not permit the Company to make any filing with any
Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement without the consent of
the Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
provided that any Party that is required to make disclosure by Applicable
Laws shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to give the other Party prior
oral or written notice and a reasonable opportunity to review or comment on
the disclosure or filing (other than with respect to confidential information
contained in such disclosure or filing). The Party making such disclosure
shall give reasonable consideration to any comments made by the other Party or

request of any Party, each Party will execute and deliver, or cause to

7.9 Tax Matters.

 

7.9.1 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. The Purchaser will prepare
or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of the
Company and each subsidiary thereof for all taxable periods that end on or
before the Closing Date to the extent such Tax Returns are filed or required
to be filed on or after the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns will be prepared
in accordance with past practice of the Company and its subsidiaries. The
Purchaser will provide drafts of the income Tax Returns described in the
preceding sentence to the Shareholder Representative no less than 30 days
before the due date for the filing of those Tax Returns (including applicable
extensions) to allow the Shareholder Representative to review and comment on
each such Tax Return prepared or caused to be prepared by the Purchaser, such
review at the Shareholder Representatives sole cost and expense. The
Purchaser will permit the Shareholder Representative and its authorized
representatives reasonable access to the Books and Records as the Shareholder
Representative may reasonably require for the purpose of reviewing the Tax
Returns. At least 10 days prior to the filing date for such Tax Returns, the
Shareholder Representative, acting reasonably, will provide any comments on
the Tax Returns to the Purchaser. The Purchaser will consider in good faith
(and, if such comments do not impact the Taxes of the Company for a post-
Closing Tax period, will incorporate) all reasonable comments of the
Shareholder Representative with respect to such Tax Returns prior to filing.

7.9.2 _Amendments or Changes to Previously Filed Tax Returns_. Other than
as required by Applicable Laws, the Purchaser will not make, refile, amend or
change any Tax Return filed by the Company or any subsidiary thereof prior to
the Effective Time with any Governmental Authority.

 

7.10 Insurance Policies.

The Company and each subsidiary will keep all insurance policies that provide
coverage for the Company and each such subsidiary as of the Closing Date in
full force and effect through at least the close of business on the Closing
Date, and will provide for the renewal of all such policies that by their
terms will expire prior to the Closing Date.

7.11 280G Waiver and Approval.

 

With respect to any Company obligation under an Employee Benefit Plan or other
agreement, contract, arrangement or plan (or portion thereof) that is
an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company will seek approval for the payment of such obligation
to any "disqualified individual" (as defined within Section 280G(c) of the
Internal Revenue Code) who has executed the waiver described in the next
sentence from the Shareholders in a vote that complies with the requirements
of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations
prescribed thereunder. Prior to soliciting the Section 280G vote described in
the preceding sentence, the Company will solicit and obtain such written
waivers from any such "disqualified individuals" as are required to exempt
any such payments from the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code.

Tilray shall, in accordance with this Agreement and within the time frames
prescribed under Applicable Laws, make such filings with and pay such fees to
securities regulatory authorities, including the British Columbia Securities
Commission and, if applicable the NASDAQ, as are necessary to ensure that the

from the prospectus and registration requirements of applicable securities
regulatory legislation rules and regulations and that such Stock

Tilray shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of
the Tilray Shares on the NASDAQ, or such other recognized stock exchange
or quotation system, provided that Tilray shall not be required to comply

arrangement, business combination or take-over bid pursuant to which Tilray
ceases to be a "reporting issuer" in a jurisdiction of Canada.

 



58

    

8.4 Milestone Payment Undertaking.

 

The Purchaser hereby agrees and undertakes to cause the Business to use
commercially reasonable efforts distribute and sell CBD products within
the United States in accordance with the business plan described on Annex 8
within the Milestone Period so as to achieve the targets set forth in Annex 2;
provided, however, if the Purchaser determines in good faith, after
consultation with William B. Chiasson, assuming that he is Chief Executive
Officer of Manitoba Harvest at the relevant time, during the Milestone Period
that a modification of the business plan, including but not limited to the
proposed SKUs, is in the best interests of the Business, the Company may
deviate from the business plan described in Annex 8 provided that such
deviation is not reasonably expected to have an adverse impact on the ability
of the Company to achieve the targets set out in Annex 2\. For purposes of
this Section 8.4, the Purchaser shall not be required to take any action that
violates Applicable Laws.

9.1.1 The Parties hereby agree that the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement will not merge on Closing but will survive the

of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which
indemnification may be sought under this Article 9 or any matter for which the
Shareholders are obligated to indemnify under this Article 9 will survive the
time at which it otherwise would terminate pursuant to this Agreement if a
Claim Notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof or in respect of the
indemnifiable matter thereunder giving rise to such right of indemnification
will have been given to the Indemnifying Party within the applicable survival
period. 

9.2 Indemnity by the Shareholders.

 

Each Shareholder shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify the Purchaser and
its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
(the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") and save them fully harmless against,
and will reimburse them for, any Damages arising from, in connection with or
related in any manner whatsoever to:

 

9.2.1 any incorrectness in or breach of any representation or warranty of
such Shareholder contained in this Agreement;

 

9.2.2 any incorrectness in or breach of any representation or warranty of
the Company contained in Article 5; and

 

9.2.3 any breach or any non-fulfilment of any covenant or agreement on the
part of such Shareholder or the Company contained in this Agreement;

9.2.4 any Taxes required to be paid by the Company (and any successor
thereto) relating or attributable to (a) any Pre-Closing Period, or (b) the
portion of a Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Closing Date, in
each case, except to the extent such Taxes were taken into account in
determining the Working Capital or Indebtedness on the Closing Date;

9.2.5 except to the extent such Indebtedness was taken into account in the
Closing Date Adjustment, all Indebtedness incurred or accrued in respect of
periods prior to the Effective Time; and

 

9.2.6 all Liabilities arising from the matter described in Section 9.2.6 of
the Disclosure Letter.

 

For greater certainty and without limiting the generality of the provisions of
Sections 9.2.1 and Section 9.2.2 , the indemnification provided for in
Section 9.2.3 through 9.2.6 shall extend to any Damages arising from any act,
omission or state of facts that occurred or existed prior to the Effective
Time, and whether or not disclosed in any Disclosure Schedule.

 



60

    

9.3 Indemnity by the Purchaser.

 

Tilray and the Purchaser shall jointly and severally indemnify the
Shareholders and their Affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents and save them fully harmless against, and will reimburse
them for, any Damages arising from, in connection with or related in any
manner whatsoever to:

 

9.3.1 any incorrectness in or breach of any representation or warranty of
the Purchaser and Tilray contained in this Agreement; and

9.3.2 any breach or any non-fulfilment of any covenant or agreement on the
part of the Purchaser or Tilray contained in this Agreement.

For greater certainty and without limiting the generality of the provision
of Section 9.3.1, the indemnification provided for in Section 9.3.2 shall
extend to any Damages arising from any act, omission or state of facts that
occurred or existed prior to the Effective Time.

 

9.4 Claim Notice.

 

9.4.1 If an Indemnified Party becomes aware of any act, omission or state
of facts that may give rise to Damages in respect of which a right of
indemnification is provided for under this Article 9, the Indemnified Party
shall promptly give written notice thereof (a "Claim Notice") to the
Indemnifying Party. The Claim Notice shall specify whether the potential
Damages arise as a result of a claim by a Person against the Indemnified Party
(a "Third Party Claim") or whether the potential Damages arise as a result of
a claim directly by the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party (a
"Direct Claim"), and shall also specify with reasonable particularity (to the
extent that the information is available):

 

9.4.1.1 the factual basis for the Direct Claim or Third Party Claim, as the
case may be; and

 

9.4.1.2 the amount of the potential Damages arising therefrom, if known.

 

9.4.2 If, through the fault of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying
Party does not receive a Claim Notice in time effectively to contest the
determination of any liability susceptible of being contested or to assert a
right to recover an amount under applicable insurance coverage, then the
liability of such Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party under this
Article 9 shall be reduced only to the extent that Damages are actually
incurred by such Indemnifying Party resulting from the Indemnified Partys
failure to give the Claim Notice to such Indemnifying Party on a timely basis.
Nothing in this Section 9.2 shall be construed to affect the time within
which a Claim Notice must be delivered pursuant to Sections 9.5 in order to
permit recovery pursuant to Section 9.2.

 

9.5 Time Limits for Claim Notice for Breach of Representations and
Warranties.

 

9.5.1 No Damages may be recovered from the Shareholders pursuant to Section
9.2.1 or 9.2.2 unless a Claim Notice is delivered by the Indemnified Party
prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set out in Section
9.1.1; provided that:

 



61

    

9.5.1.1 if the Claim Notice has been delivered prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period set out in Section 9.1.1, but is unresolved at the
conclusion of such period, or

9.5.1.2 if in respect of a Fraud Claim,

then notwithstanding the foregoing time limitations, the rights of
indemnification in this Article 9 and the liability for such claim
will continue beyond the expiration of such period until such claim is
resolved.

9.5.2 This Section 9.5 shall not be construed to impose any time limit on
an Indemnified Partys right to assert a claim to recover Damages under
Sections 9.2.3 through 9.2.6, whether or not the basis on which such a claim
is asserted could also entitle the Purchaser to make a claim for Damages
pursuant to Section 9.2.1 or 9.2.2, respectively.

9.6 Monetary Limitations.

 

9.6.1 No Damages may be recovered from the Shareholder pursuant to Section
9.2.2, other than in respect of the Fundamental Representations, unless and
until the accumulated aggregate amount of Damages of the Indemnified Party
arising pursuant to Section 9.2.2 exceeds $2,000,000, in which event, subject
to Section 9.6.2, the accumulated aggregate amount of all such Damages may be
recovered.

9.6.2 No Damages may be recovered from the Shareholders pursuant to (a)
Section 9.2.2 for breaches of non-Fundamental Representations in excess of the
Recourse Amount or (b) Sections 9.2.2 for breaches of Fundamental
Representations or Section 9.2.1 or Sections 9.2.3 through 9.2.5, in excess
of the aggregate value of the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration (at
the time of its issuance) received by the Shareholders.

 

9.6.3 No Damages may be recovered from the Shareholders pursuant to Section
9.2.6 in excess of $12,800,000.

 

9.6.4 No Damages may be recovered from the Purchaser or Tilray, taken
together, pursuant to (a) Section 9.3.1 for breaches of 6.3.2, 6.5, 6.8 or
6.9 in excess of the Recourse Amount, or (b) Sections 9.3.1 for breaches of
Section 6.1, 6.2, 6.3.1; 6.4, 6.6, 6.7 or 6.10 or Sections 9.3.2, in excess of
the aggregate value of the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration (at the
time of its issuance) payable to the Shareholders hereunder.

9.6.5 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sections 9.6.1, 9.6.2, 9.6.3 and
9.6.4 will not apply to limit an Indemnifying Partys obligations and
liability for Fraud Claims.

 

9.6.6 The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification under Section
9.2 shall be calculated net of insurance proceeds under the RandW Insurance
Policy actually received by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties on account of
such Damages, net of the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) of recovery or collection, including
any deductibles, retentions or similar costs or payments and any increases in
premiums (collectively, " _Recovery Costs_ "). In the event that an insurance
recovery under RandW Insurance Policy is actually received by any Purchaser
Indemnified Party with respect to any Damages for which any such Purchaser
Indemnified Party has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund shall be made
to the Shareholders by the Purchaser Indemnified Party in an amount 

 



62

    

 equal to the lesser of (1) the aggregate amount of the recovery actually
received by such Purchaser Indemnified Party, net of any Recovery Costs, and
(2) the amount of the indemnification payment previously received by such
Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to such Damages.

9.7 Calculation of Damages.

For greater certainty, for the purposes of determining whether there has been
a breach of a representation or warranty and for calculating the amount of
Damages under this Article 9 resulting therefrom, the representations and
warranties of the Shareholders contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been made without qualifications as to materiality where the words or
phrases "material", "immaterial", "in all material respects" or words or
phrases of similar import are used, such that the amount of Damages payable to
a Purchaser Indemnified Party is not subject to any deduction in respect of
amounts below the level of materiality stated in the relevant representation
and warranty.

9.8 Agency for Non-Parties.

Notwithstanding Section 13.7, the Purchaser hereby accepts each indemnity in
favour of each Purchaser Indemnified Party who is not a party to this
Agreement as agent and trustee of that Indemnified Party. The Purchaser may
enforce an indemnity in favour of any Purchaser Indemnified Party on behalf of
such Purchaser Indemnified Party.

 

9.9 Direct Claims.

In the case of a Direct Claim, each Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days
from receipt of a Claim Notice in respect thereof within which to make such
investigation as the Indemnifying Party considers necessary or desirable. For
the purpose of such investigation, the Indemnified Party shall make available
to the Indemnifying Party the information relied upon by the Indemnified Party
to substantiate its right to be indemnified under this Article 9, together
with all such other information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request. If the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party fail to agree at or
before the expiration of such 30 day period (or any mutually agreed upon
extension thereof), the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue
such remedies as may be available to it.

9.10 Third Party Claims.

 

9.10.1 In the event a Claim Notice is delivered with respect to a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its expense, to
participate in but not control the negotiation, settlement or defence of the
Third Party Claim, which control shall rest at all times with the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party will have the exclusive right to contest, settle
or pay the amount claimed; provided, however, that except with the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, no settlement with respect to such Third
Party Claim will be determinative of whether the Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Article 9 or the amount of such
indemnification, if any.

9.10.2 If any Third Party Claim is of a nature such that it is necessary
in the reasonable view of the Indemnified Party acting in a manner consistent
with reasonable commercial practices, in respect of (A) a Third Party Claim by
a customer relating to products or services supplied by the Business or (B) a
Third Party Claim relating to any contract which is necessary to the ongoing
operations of the Business or any material part thereof in order to avoid
material damage to the 

 



63

    

 relationship between the Indemnified Party and any of its major customers or
to preserve the rights of the Indemnified Party under such an essential
contract, to make a payment to any Person (a "Third Party") with respect to
the Third Party Claim before the completion of settlement negotiations or
related Actions, as the case may be, then the Indemnified Party may make such
payment and the Shareholders shall, promptly after demand by the Indemnified
Party, reimburse the Indemnified Party for such payment. If the amount of any
liability of the Indemnified Party under the Third Party Claim in respect of
which such a payment was made, as finally determined, is less than the amount
which was paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall, promptly after receipt of the difference from the
Third Party, pay the amount of such difference to the Indemnifying Party.

 

9.11 Right to Recover.

 

9.11.1 Except in the case of Fraud Claims, the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties right to recover for Damages (A) in the case of any claims made
pursuant to Sections 9.2.1 and 9.2.2, subject to Section 9.6.1, shall first be
satisfied from the Shareholders (on a several basis), in each case up to a
maximum of such Shareholders Pro Rata Portion of the Recourse Amount, and
(B) thereafter, in the case of any claims made pursuant to Sections 9.2.1 or
9.2.2, from the RandW Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, except in the case of Fraud Claims and in
respect of claims for breaches of Fundamental Representations, after Closing,
to the extent that Damages incurred under Sections 9.2.1 and 9.2.2
(collectively, the "Insured Losses") are subject to an indemnification
obligation of a Shareholder under this Article 9, the RandW Insurance Policy
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
for such Insured Losses after the payment of Damages to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for indemnification claims from the
Shareholders Pro Rata Portion of the Recourse Amount. Such sole recourse will
apply, and the Shareholders will have no additional liability therefor, even
in circumstances where the RandW Insurance Policy does not cover such Damages,
including, without limitation, as a result of exclusions, limitations and
deductions in respect of the RandW Insurance Policy. For greater certainty, the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to seek indemnification from
the Shareholders with respect to (but subject to any applicable limitations
and conditions set forth in this Article 9) any Damages in connection with (A)
any Fraud Claim and (B) any claim for a breach of a Fundamental
Representation in the case where the Damages from such breach exceed the sum
of the Recourse Amount and the limit under the RandW Insurance Policy, in which
case the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
seek indemnification from the Shareholders for such excess (subject to the
limitation contained in Section 9.6.2).

9.12 Set-off.

The Purchaser may, without duplication, set-off and deduct the amount of any
Damages subject to indemnification under this Agreement against any other
amounts payable by the Purchaser to the applicable Shareholders under this
Agreement; provided that any such amounts, other than amounts payable in
accordance with Section 2.8, so set-off and deducted without the written
consent of the Shareholder Representative thereto will be paid into an
escrow with a nationally recognized escrow agent pending release upon
settlement or a non-appealable judgement of a court of competent jurisdiction.

 



64

    

9.13 Exclusive Remedy.

 

From and after the completion of the sale and purchase of the Company Shares
herein contemplated, except in the case of Fraud Claims, the rights
of indemnity set out in this Article 9 are the sole and exclusive remedies of
the Parties in respect of any incorrectness in or breach of any representation
or warranty included in this Agreement.

 

9.14 Insurance Recoveries

The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this
Article 9 will be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party under insurance policies (net of any costs of recovery and increased
premiums).

 

9.15 Mitigation.

Nothing in the Article 9 shall relieve a Party of its obligation under
Applicable Laws to mitigate Damages.

ARTICLE 11

 

 _TERMINATION_

11.1 Grounds for Termination.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement may be terminated and the Contemplated Transactions may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

11.1.1 by the mutual written agreement of the Purchaser and the Company;

11.1.2 by the Purchaser in the event of a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained herein shall have
occurred that would cause the conditions set out in Sections 10.1 and 10.3 not
to be satisfied and has not been cured within 5 days following notice of such
breach by the Purchaser to the Shareholder Representative, and such
conditions are incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date as reasonably
determined by the Purchaser; provided, however, that there will be no right to
terminate if such breach was caused, in whole or in part, by a breach by the
Purchaser. For greater certainty, any failure by the Company to satisfy any of
the conditions of Closing contained in Section 10.3 will be deemed to be a
material breach of a covenant and agreement of this Agreement by the
Company provided that the cause of such failure by the Company to satisfy
such condition was not the result, in whole or in part, of any breach of this
Agreement by the Purchaser;

 

11.1.3 by the Company in the event of a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of the Purchaser or Tilray contained herein,
shall have occurred that would cause the conditions set out in Sections 10.1
and 10.2 not to be satisfied and has not been cured within 5 days following
notice of such breach by the Shareholder Representative to the Purchaser, and
such conditions are incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date as
reasonably determined by the Company; provided, however, that there will be no
right to terminate if such breach was caused, in whole or in part, by a breach
by the Company. For greater certainty, any failure by the Purchaser to
satisfy any of the conditions of Closing contained in Section 10.2 will be
deemed to be a material breach of a covenant and agreement of this Agreement
by the Purchaser, provided that the cause of such failure the Purchaser to
satisfy such condition was not the result, in whole or in part, of any breach
of this Agreement by the Company;

 

11.1.4 by the Purchaser or the Company if any Governmental Authority will
have issued a final and non-appealable order, decree or judgment permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the completion of the
Contemplated Transactions or any Governmental Authority (including Health
Canada) has refused to provide a consent or approval set out, or required by
the terms of this Agreement to be set out, in Section 5.3 of the Disclosure
Schedule; or

 



68

    

11.1.5 provided that the NASDAQ has completed its review of the
Contemplated Transactions, by the Purchaser or the Company if the Closing
will not have occurred on or before April 30, 2019 (or such later date as may
be agreed to in writing by the Purchaser and the Company) (the " _Outside
Date_ "); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 11.1.5 will not be available to any Party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under, or breach of any provision of, this Agreement
will have been the cause of, or will have resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur on or before the Outside Date.

11.2 Notice of Termination.

 

Any Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1 will
give written notice of such termination to the other Parties to
this Agreement in accordance with Section 13.2.

11.3 Effect of Termination.

 

11.3.1 If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Article 11, this
Agreement will forthwith become void and of no further force and effect and
all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder will be terminated without
further liability of any Party to any other Party; provided, however, that:
(i) the provisions of this Section 11.3 and Article 13, and the rights and
obligations of the Parties thereunder, will survive any such termination; and
(ii) nothing herein will relieve any Party from liability for any Fraud Claim
under this Agreement prior to the date of termination.

 

11.3.2 If this Agreement is terminated by the Purchaser or the Company
under Section 11.1.2 or 11.1.3, respectively, then the Company or the
Purchaser, respectively, shall remain fully liable for any and all Damages
sustained or incurred by the Purchaser or the Company, respectively, directly
or indirectly as a result thereof. For the purposes of this Section 11.3.2,
Damages shall include all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement.

 

ARTICLE 12

_SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE _

12.1 Appointment.

By virtue of the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement in
exchange for consideration pursuant to this Agreement, the Shareholders
irrevocably nominate, constitute and appoint the Shareholder Representative as
the agent and true and lawful attorney in fact of the Shareholders, with full
power of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of the Shareholders
for purposes of (i) executing any documents and taking any actions that the
Shareholder Representative may, in the Shareholder Representatives sole
discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate in connection
with any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under
Article 9 and (ii) doing all things and performing all acts, as contemplated
by or deemed advisable by the Shareholder Representative in connection with
this Agreement, including receiving any notice or other document required to
be given to the Shareholders, giving any notice or providing any other
document to be given or provided by the Shareholders and, except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, receiving payment of any amounts to be paid to
the Shareholders hereunder. The Shareholder Representative hereby
accepts such appointment as the agent and true and lawful attorney in fact of
the Shareholders. The Shareholders recognize and intend that the power of
attorney granted in this Article 12 is coupled with an 

 



69

    

 interest and is irrevocable, may not be delegated by the Shareholder
Representative and will survive the death, incapacity, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of each of the Shareholders. 

12.2 Authority; Reliance

The Shareholders grant to the Shareholder Representative full authority to
execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on behalf of the Shareholders
(in the name of any or all of the Shareholders or otherwise) any and all
documents that the Shareholder Representative may, in the Shareholder
Representatives sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or
appropriate, in such forms and containing such provisions as the Shareholder
Representative may, in the Shareholder Representatives sole discretion,
determine to be appropriate, in performing the Shareholder Representatives
duties as contemplated by this Article 12; provided, however, that the
Shareholder Representative will have no obligation to act on behalf of the
Shareholders except as expressly provided herein. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement executed in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein, (i) each Indemnified
Party will be entitled to deal exclusively with the Shareholder Representative
on all matters relating to any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under this Agreement and (ii) the Purchaser, Tilray and
each Indemnified Party will be entitled to rely conclusively (without further
evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be
executed on behalf of any Shareholder, by the Shareholder Representative, and
on any other action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any
Shareholder, by the Shareholder Representative, as fully binding upon such
Shareholder.

 

12.3 Replacement.

If the Shareholder Representative is unable to fulfill the Shareholder
Representatives responsibilities hereunder, the Shareholders will, within 10
days after such inability, appoint a successor to the Shareholder
Representative (who will be reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser) and
immediately thereafter notify the Purchaser of the identity of such successor.
Any such successor will succeed the Shareholder Representative as the agent
and true and lawful attorney in fact of the Shareholders hereunder.

ARTICLE 13

_GENERAL PROVISIONS_

13.1 Arbitration.

 

13.1.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all disputes,
controversies or claims arising out of, relating to, or in respect of this
Agreement, including any issue regarding its existence, validity,
enforceability, interpretation, breach or termination (each a " _Dispute_ ")
shall be resolved in accordance with the following.

 

13.1.1.1 any Dispute that the Parties are unable to amicably resolve or
settle between themselves through negotiations between the Parties within
fifteen (15) Business Days (or such longer period as is expressly provided for
in this Agreement or which the Parties may mutually agree to in writing) of a
Party being provided notice of such Dispute or difference in accordance with
Section 13.2 (the " _Consultation Period_ ") shall be referred to and finally
determined by final and binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be
confidential and shall be conducted by one independent and impartial
arbitrator selected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the "
_Arbitrator_ ");

 



70

    

13.1.1.2 the arbitration shall be governed by the _Commercial
Arbitration Act_ (British Columbia) to the extent that such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this Section 13.1;

 

13.1.1.3 the arbitration shall be seated in the City of Vancouver and the
arbitration agreement set out in this Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia. The
language of the arbitration shall be English;

 

13.1.1.4 within thirty (30) days following the expiration of the
Consultation Period, the Parties agree to jointly select the Arbitrator who
shall be trained in the laws of British Columbia. The Arbitrator shall be
impartial and independent of the Parties and shall be experienced and
knowledgeable about the subject matter of the Dispute (generally and not as to
the express facts concerning the Dispute). If the Parties are unable to agree
upon the Arbitrator, either Party may apply to elect an Arbitrator in
accordance with the provisions of the _Commercial Arbitration Act_ (British
Columbia);

 

13.1.1.5 it is specifically acknowledged and confirmed that any Dispute
that cannot be resolved between the Parties prior to the expiry of the
Consultation Period shall be submitted to arbitration irrespective of the
magnitude thereof or the amount in question;

 

13.1.1.6 the Arbitrator shall have jurisdiction: (i) to apply all
Applicable Laws, common law and equity (including the scope of the agreement
to arbitrate, any statute of limitations, conflict of laws rules, tort claims
and interest claims); and (ii) to make an award or awards in respect of
interest and the payment of the costs of the arbitration
(including arbitrators fees and the legal costs of the Parties). The
Arbitrator also may, where requested by a Party, determine the nature and
extent of production of documents and oral depositions;

 

13.1.1.7 the award of the Arbitrator shall be reduced to writing and be
final and binding on the Parties and not subject to any appeal (a " _Final
Determination_ "). Any monetary award shall be made and payable, free of any
Taxes or other deduction, and shall bear interest from the date of any breach
or other violation of this Agreement to the date on which the award is paid,
at a rate determined by the Arbitrator;

13.1.1.8 judgment upon the award(s) rendered by the Arbitrator may
be entered and executed in any court of competent jurisdiction, or
application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award
and order of enforcement;

 

13.1.1.9 each Party shall bear its own expenses, and the expenses of its
Affiliates and associates, of preparing for and participating in connection
with the arbitration, including legal fees but the Party against whom judgment
is rendered shall bear all legal fees of the Arbitrator; and

 

13.1.1.10 by agreeing to arbitration, the Parties do not intend to deprive
any court of its jurisdiction to issue a pre-arbitral injunction, pre-arbitral
attachment or other order in aid of the arbitration proceedings and the
enforcement of any award. Without prejudice to such provisional remedies in
aid of arbitration as may be available under the

 



71

    

 jurisdiction of a legal court, the Arbitrator shall have full authority to
grant provisional remedies, statutory remedies and to award damages for the
failure of the Parties or its representatives to respect the Arbitrators
orders to that effect.

Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict or prohibit a Party from commencing
arbitration at any time, including prior to the expiry of a Consultation
Period, in order to protect its rights under this Agreement or in relation to
a Dispute.

 

13.1.2 The dispute resolution obligations and processes set out in this
Section 13.1 shall be the exclusive and exhaustive Dispute resolution
procedures between the Parties and their respective Affiliates and associates,
and the decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties
and their respective Affiliates and associates.

 

13.1.3 Except where reasonably prevented by the nature of the Dispute, the
Parties shall continue to perform, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates and associates to continue to perform, their respective duties,
obligations and responsibilities under this Agreement while the Dispute is
being resolved in accordance with this Section 13.1, unless and until
such obligations are lawfully terminated or expire in accordance with the
provisions thereof.

Any notice, direction or other communication given regarding the matters
contemplated by this Agreement (each a " _Notice_ ") must be in writing, sent

of such email transmission does not receive a delivery failure notice from the
intended recipient in respect of such email transmission), or similar means

other electronic transmission) in any number of counterparts, each of which
will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and
the same instrument.

13.4 Amendments and Waivers.

This Agreement may not be amended or waived except by an instrument in writing
signed by an authorized representative of each Party. No course of conduct or

exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

13.5 Severability.

 

Wherever possible, each provision hereof will be interpreted in such manner as
to be effective and valid under Applicable Laws, but if any one or more of
the provisions contained herein will, for any reason, be held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction,
such provision will be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the
remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or
any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be unreasonable.

 



73

    

13.6 Assignment; Successors and Assigns.

 

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of any
Party hereunder may be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred by such
Party, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without
the prior written consent of each other Party and any attempt to make any such
assignment, delegation or other transfer without such consent will be null and
void; provided, however, that the Purchaser may assign its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement, without the consent of the other
Parties, to any Person who acquires all or substantially all of the assets and
business of the Purchaser or to any Affiliate of the Purchaser, subject to
the assumption in writing by such Person or Affiliate of the Purchasers
obligations hereunder; and provided, further, that the Purchaser may assign or
encumber this Agreement or any of its rights and obligations hereunder as
security for any indebtedness of the Purchaser or its Affiliates without the
consent of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

13.7 No Third Party Beneficiaries.

 

Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended or will be
construed to confer upon any third party, other than the signatories to
this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns permitted by
Section 13.6 and except as specifically provided for in Section 9.8, any
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

13.8 Governing Law.

This Agreement and all Disputes and controversies relating to or arising out
of this Agreement are governed by and will be interpreted and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the federal
laws of Canada applicable therein. Each signatory to this Agreement
irrevocably attorns and submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
British Columbia courts situated in the City of Vancouver (and appellate
courts therefrom) and waives objection to the venue of any proceeding in such
court or that such court provides an inappropriate forum.

13.9 Specific Performance. 

The Parties agree that irreparable and ongoing damages would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its terms or otherwise was breached. Accordingly, each Party agrees that
in the event of any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement by another
Party, the non-breaching Party will be entitled, in addition to all other
rights and remedies that it may have, to obtain injunctive or other equitable
relief (including a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction and
a final injunction) to prevent any actual or threatened breach of any of such
provisions and to enforce such provisions specifically, without the necessity
of posting a bond or other security or of proving actual damages. The
prevailing Party in any action commenced under this Section 13.9
(whether through a monetary judgment, injunctive relief or otherwise) will be
entitled to recover from the other Parties reimbursement for its reasonable
legal fees and court costs incurred in connection with such action.

 



74

    

13.10 Interpretation; Absence of Presumption.

 

13.10.1 The defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. In this Agreement, except to the extent
otherwise provided herein or that the context otherwise requires: (i) words
used in the singular include the plural and words in the plural include
the singular; (ii) reference to any gender includes the other gender; (iii)
the words "include", "includes" and "including" will be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation"; (iv) the words "herein", "hereof",
"hereto", "hereunder" and words of similar import will be deemed references to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Section or other provision
hereof; (v) reference to any Article, Section, Exhibit or Annex will mean
such Article or Section of, or such Exhibit or Annex to, this Agreement, as
the case may be, and references in any Section or definition to any clause
means such clause of such Section or definition; (vi) reference to any
Applicable Laws will mean such Applicable Laws (including all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder) as amended, modified, codified or
reenacted, in whole or in part, and in effect at the time of determining
compliance or applicability; and (vii) references to "$" and "CDN" are to the
lawful currency of Canada. Whenever the last day for the exercise of any
privilege or the discharge or any duty hereunder will fall upon a day that is
not a Business Day, the Party having such privilege or duty may exercise such
privilege or discharge such duty on the next succeeding day which is a
Business Day.

 

13.10.2 Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the Parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In
the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

13.10.3 In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in this
Agreement and statements in the Disclosure Schedule or the other schedules
referred to herein, the statements in this Agreement will control and the
statements in the Disclosure Schedule and the other schedules referred to
herein will be disregarded to the extent of such inconsistency.

13.11 Disclosure.

 

The obligations herein will not prevent any Party from making, after
consultation with the other Party, such disclosure as its legal counsel
advises is required by Applicable Laws (including in order to comply with
continuous disclosure or other requirements under Applicable Laws). For
greater certainty, the Shareholders hereby consent to the reasonable
disclosure by Tilray, and Tilray and the Purchaser hereby consent to the
reasonable disclosure by the Shareholder Representative, of the nature and
completion of the Contemplated Transactions to: (i) Governmental Authorities;
(ii) the security holders of Tilray or the Shareholder Representative, as
applicable; and (iii) in the case of Tilray, any other Person in connection
with any financing, offering, licensing, business combination or similar
transaction proposed to be undertaken by Tilray; provided that in all
cases where Tilray or the Shareholder Representative proposes to make any
disclosure of the completion, nature or terms of the Contemplated Transactions
(whether with the consent of the other) or in accordance with the foregoing
exceptions to the requirement to obtain such consent, the disclosing Party:
(x) first advise the other of its intention to do so and it will use
commercially reasonable efforts to enable the other to review and comment on
such disclosure prior to the release thereof; and (y) in the case of (i) and
(ii), advise the Persons to whom the information is being disclosed of the
disclosing Partys confidentiality obligations hereunder and shall cause such
Persons to 

 



75

    

 hold such information confidential on terms substantially similar to, and no
less stringent than, the confidentiality obligations under this Agreement. The
Shareholders acknowledge that Tilray may be required, in accordance with
Applicable Laws, to publicly disclose the transactions contemplated herein and
to file a copy of this Agreement on SEDAR, and in such case Tilray agrees that
it shall make such redactions to this Agreement as are permitted under
Section 12.2(3) of National Instrument 51-102 ("NI 51-102") (subject to
compliance by Tilray with the remaining provisions of Section 12.2 of NI
51-102) with the prior consultation of the Shareholder Representative.
