 **ARTICLE II**

  

 **Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the 
 Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates; Company Stock Options**

  

SECTION 2.1. _ Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of Company Common Stock (any such share, together with the associated
rights to purchase any portion of a share of Series B Junior Participating
Preferred Stock (the " ** _Rights_** ") issued under the Rights Agreement,
dated as of December 16, 2003 between the Company and Computershare Investor
Services, LLC, as rights agent (the " ** _Rights Agreement_** "), a " **
_Share_** ") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  

(a) _ Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of
common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation and, to the extent that there are any
issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock of Merger Sub, each issued
and outstanding share of preferred stock of Merger Sub shall be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation
(such preferred stock to have the voting powers, designations, preferences
and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and
qualifications, limitations and restrictions, as set forth in the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation).

  

(b) _ Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Any shares
of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and
any Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub, shall be automatically canceled and
shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

  

(c) _ Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each issued and outstanding
Share (other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to

       

receive $22.00 in cash, without interest (the " ** _Merger Consideration_**
"). As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any such Shares (each, a " ** _Certificate_** ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b), without interest.

  

(d) _ Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor
of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to, and who complies
in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " **
_Dissenting Stockholders_** "), shall not be converted into or be
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the " **
_Dissenting Shares_** "), but instead such holder shall be entitled to
payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting
Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right, such holderÂ’s Shares shall thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to
receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such
Share, in accordance with Section 2.1(c), without any interest thereon. The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to stockholdersÂ’ rights of appraisal, and (ii) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or unless and to
the extent required to do so under applicable Law, make any payment with
respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for
payment or waive any failure by a stockholder to timely comply with the
requirements of the DGCL to perfect or demand appraisal rights. Any portion
of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to
Section 2.2 to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected
shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

  

SECTION 2.2. _ Exchange of Certificates._

  

(a) _ Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a bank or trust company to act as agent for the holders of Shares in
connection with the Merger (the " ** _Paying Agent_** ") to receive, for
the benefit of holders of Shares, the aggregate Merger Consideration to
which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c). At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit such aggregate
Merger Consideration (the " ** _Payment Fund_** ") in an account with the
Paying Agent. The Payment Fund shall, pending its disbursement to
such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, the Payment Fund
will be payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs. If for any reason
(including losses) the cash in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to
fully satisfy all of the payment obligations in respect of the Merger
Consideration to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall
promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to
the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash
payment obligations.

  

(b) _ Payment Procedures._ Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon

       

delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such
form and shall have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without
interest, for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate surrendered or shall have established
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax
either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, without interest.

  

(c) _ Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock._ The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of Shares upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Certificates, and at
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.2(e),
if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

  

(d) _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this Article II.

  

(e) _ Termination of Fund._ At any time following one year after
the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Payment Fund (including any
interest received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the
Paying Agent and which has not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by
such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest
thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

(f) _ No Liability._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger

       

Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(g) _ Withholding Taxes._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " ** _Code_** "),
or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority,
the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

  

SECTION 2.3. _ Company Stock Options._ Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that each option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then
vested or exercisable) that represents the right to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock (each, an " ** _Option_** ") shall be cancelled and terminated
(without regard to the exercise price of the Options) as of the Effective
Time, and that all Options (whether or not vested), other than Options with
respect to which the holder thereof has elected to exercise as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted at the Effective Time into
the right to receive a cash amount from the Surviving Corporation equal to
the Option Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject
to such Option. Except as otherwise provided below, the Option Consideration
shall be paid as soon after the Closing Date as shall be practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Option Consideration otherwise
payable such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. Parent shall at all times from and after the
Effective Time cause the Surviving Corporation to have (and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain) sufficient liquid funds to satisfy the Surviving
CorporationÂ’s obligations to holders of Options pursuant to this Section
2.3. In addition, the Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that
the Company will not at the Effective Time be bound by any options,
stock appreciation rights, warrants or other rights or agreements which would
entitle any Person, other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, to own any
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in
respect thereof, other than the payment of the Option Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.3 with respect to Options unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, " **
_Option Consideration_** " means, with respect to any share of Company Common
Stock issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of (i) the Merger Consideration over (ii) the exercise price payable in
respect of such share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Option.

  

SECTION 2.4. _ Adjustments._ Notwithstanding any provision of this
Article II to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in
Section 5.2 hereof), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of the
occurrence or record date of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange
of shares or similar transaction, the Merger Consideration and the Option
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange
of shares or similar transaction.

 **Representations and Warranties of the Company**

  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except as

condition that is disclosed in any section of such disclosure schedule in
such a way as to make its relevance to a representation or representations
made elsewhere in this Agreement or information called for by another section
of such disclosure schedule readily apparent shall be deemed to be an
exception to such representation or representations or to be disclosed on
such other section of such disclosure schedule notwithstanding the omission
of a reference or cross reference thereto and (y) the mere inclusion of an

Agreement (the " ** _Company Disclosure Schedule_** ") or (ii) in the Filed

other consents, approvals, filings, declarations or registrations that, if

any material respect the ability of the Company to operate its business or
perform its obligations hereunder, or prevent or materially impede, interfere
with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Transactions.

  

SECTION 3.5. _ Company SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities._

  

(a) The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, prospectuses, and
registration, proxy and other statements required to be filed by it with the
SEC since January 1, 2003 (collectively, and together with all documents
filed on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, and in each case including exhibits
and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, the "
** _Company SEC Documents_** "). None of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries is
required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.
As of their respective effective dates (in the case of Company SEC Documents
that are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the
Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of
all other Company SEC Documents), the Company SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such
Company SEC Documents. None of the Company SEC Documents contained, when
filed or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such
amendment, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Regulation S-X) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
the absence of footnotes and to normal and recurring year-end audit
adjustments, in each case to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X).

       

(c) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " **
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_** "), the Company has been and is in compliance in all
material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii)
the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
Nasdaq Stock Market. The Company has designed disclosure controls and
procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company,
including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and
the Chief Financial Officer of the Company by others within those entities.
The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the
date hereof, to the CompanyÂ’s auditors and the audit committee of the
CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect the CompanyÂ’s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud or allegation of fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the CompanyÂ’s internal controls over financial reporting.
As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company has not
received any complaints since December 31, 2004 regarding accounting,
internal accounting controls or auditing matters, including any such
complaint regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. To the
Knowledge of the Company, the Company has not identified any
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to
believe that its auditors and its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when due. There are no outstanding loans made by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in
Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company.

  

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise, whether known or unknown) whether or not required, if known, to be
reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company
prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, except liabilities (i)
as and to the extent reflected or reserved against on the unaudited balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2005 (the " **
_Balance Sheet Date_** ") (including the notes thereto) included in
the Company SEC Documents filed by the Company and publicly available prior
to the date of this Agreement (the " ** _Filed Company SEC Documents_** "),
(ii) incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of
business, or (iii) that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
(excluding from the definition of Material Adverse Effect, for the purposes
of this clause (iii) only, any matter specified in clause (w) of the
definition of Material Adverse Effect occurring on or prior to the date
hereof).

  

SECTION 3.6. _ Absence of Certain Changes or Events._ Since the Balance
Sheet Date there have not been any events, changes, occurrences or state of
facts that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (excluding from the
definition of Material Adverse Effect, for the purposes of this sentence
only, any matter specified in clause (w) of the definition of Material
Adverse Effect occurring on or prior to the date hereof). Except as disclosed
in the Filed Company SEC Documents, since the Balance Sheet Date (a)
the Company and its Subsidiaries have operated their respective businesses in
all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice and (b) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
taken prior to the date hereof (or will take after the date hereof without
the consent of Parent) any action described in Sections 5.2(b), (d), (f) or
(g) hereof that if taken after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time without the prior written consent of Parent would violate such
provision. Without limiting the foregoing, except as disclosed in the Filed
Company SEC Documents, since the Balance Sheet Date there has not occurred
any damage, destruction or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) of any
material asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which materially
affects the use thereof.

SECTION 3.7. _ Legal Proceedings._ There is no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, material legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceeding, claim, suit or action against, or governmental
or regulatory investigation of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor
is there any injunction, order, judgment, ruling or decree imposed (or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened to be imposed) upon the Company, any

of Governmental Authorities (collectively, **" _Laws_ ")**, and the listing
and corporate governance requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market, applicable
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their properties or other

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries are (and since January 1, 2003 have

claimed or alleged that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was not in
compliance with all Laws applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any of their properties or other assets or any of their
businesses or operations or (ii) was considering the amendment, termination,
revocation or cancellation of any Permit. The consummation of the Merger, in
and of itself, will not cause the revocation or cancellation of any Permit.

  

SECTION 3.9. _ Information in Proxy Statement._ The Proxy Statement and
any other document filed with the SEC by the Company in connection with the
Merger (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto), at the date first
mailed to the stockholders of the Company, at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting and at the time filed with the SEC, as the case may be,
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no representation is made by the

benefits otherwise payable under any Company Plan, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any rights with respect to
benefits under any such plan, or (iv) require any contributions or payments

organization activity involving any of the employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor
has there ever been union representation involving any of the employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no picketing pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, and there are no strikes,
slowdowns, work stoppages, other job actions, lockouts,

the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted,

will result in the grant of any right or license with respect to any Company

sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement and the Transactions the
restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the
DGCL) as set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL to the extent, if any, that
Section 203 of the DGCL would otherwise be applicable to this Agreement and
the Transactions. No other "fair price", "moratorium", "control share
acquisition" or other similar antitakeover statute or regulation enacted
under state or federal laws in the United States applicable to the Company is
applicable to the Merger or the other Transactions.  The Company has taken
all actions necessary to (a) render the Rights Agreement, inapplicable to
this Agreement (and any amendments hereto) and the Transactions, (b)
ensure that (i) the Rights do not become exercisable or otherwise

SECTION 5.3. _ No Solicitation by the Company; Etc._

  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the CompanyÂ’s and
its SubsidiariesÂ’ respective directors, officers and employees to, and shall
use its best efforts to cause the CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ investment
bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, agents and other
representatives (collectively, and together with the CompanyÂ’s and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ directors, officers and employees, the " ** _Representatives_**
") to, immediately cease and terminate any discussions or negotiations with
any Person conducted heretofore with respect to a Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the CompanyÂ’s and
its SubsidiariesÂ’ respective directors, officers and employees not to, and
shall use its best efforts to cause its other Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, cause, facilitate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or
proposals that constitute, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal, (ii) other than informing persons of the existence of the
provisions contained in this Section 5.3, participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any third party regarding any Takeover Proposal or (iii)
enter into any agreement related to any Takeover Proposal; _provided,
however_ , that if after the date hereof the Board of Directors of the
Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal made
after the date hereof in circumstances not involving a breach of this
Agreement or any standstill agreement, and the Board of Directors of the
Company reasonably determines in good faith that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and with
respect to which such Board determines in good faith (after consulting with
outside counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with such BoardÂ’s fiduciary duties to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under
Delaware law, then the Company may, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval) and after providing Parent not less than 24 hours
written notice of its intention to take such actions (A) furnish information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Takeover Proposal, but only after such Person enters into a customary
confidentiality agreement with the Company (which confidentiality agreement
must be no less favorable to the Company ( _i.e._ , no less restrictive with
respect to the conduct of such Person) than the Confidentiality Agreement),
provided that (1) such confidentiality agreement may not include any
provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and
(2) the Company advises Parent of all such non-public information delivered
to such Person concurrently with its delivery to such Person and concurrently
with its delivery to such Person the Company delivers to Parent all such
information not previously provided to Parent, and (B) participate in
discussions and negotiations with such Person regarding such
Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any
violation of the foregoing restrictions of the Company by the CompanyÂ’s
Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 5.3 by the Company. The Company shall provide Parent with a correct
and complete copy of any confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to
this paragraph within 24 hours of the execution thereof.

  

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 5.3, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in writing,
and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact is received by, any information is requested from,
or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued
with, the Company in respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any such
notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal,
offer, inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals
or offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with
such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of
such Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and
thereafter shall promptly keep Parent reasonably informed of all material
developments affecting the status and terms of any such proposals, offers,
inquiries or requests (and the Company shall provide Parent with copies of
any additional written materials received that relate to such proposals,
offers, inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

       

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(c), neither the Board
of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw
or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or the approval or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Directors of this Agreement and the
Transactions (including the Merger) or (B) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal (any action described
in this clause (i) being referred to as a " ** _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_** "), (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve or recommend, or cause or authorize the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
memorandum of understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture
agreement or other agreement related to any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement in accordance with Section 5.3(a)) (each, a " **
_Company Acquisition Agreement_** "), or (iii) except as contemplated by this
Agreement, amend or waive the Rights Agreement, redeem the Rights or take any
action which would allow any Person other than Parent to acquire beneficial
ownership of 20% or more of the shares of Company Common Stock without
causing a "Distribution Date," a "Triggering Event," or a "Stock Acquisition
Date" (each as defined in the Rights Agreement) to occur. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw or modify the Company
Board Recommendation, or recommend a Takeover Proposal, or enter into a
definitive Company Acquisition Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal,
or take any of the actions specified in clauses (i) and (iii) of the
preceding sentence, if such Board determines in good faith, after consulting
with, and receiving advice from, outside counsel, that the failure to make
such withdrawal, modification or recommendation, or enter into such
agreement, or take such action, would, more likely than not, constitute
a breach by the Board of Directors of the Company of its fiduciary duties to
the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under Delaware law; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
with respect to the Company entering into a definitive Company Acquisition
Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, the Company shall comply with
the last sentence of this Section 5.3(c) and Article VII, and _provided,
further,_  that, no Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made in
response to a Superior Proposal until after the third business day following
ParentÂ’s receipt of written notice (unless at the time such notice is
otherwise required to be given there are less than three business days prior
to the Company Stockholders Meeting, in which case the Company shall provide
as much notice as is reasonably practicable) from the Company (a " **
_Company Adverse Recommendation Notice_** ") advising Parent that the
Board of Directors of the Company intends to make such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and specifying the terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Company Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new three business
day period (unless at the time such notice is otherwise required to be given
there are less than three business days prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, in which case the Company shall provide as much notice as is
reasonably practicable)). In determining whether to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall take into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent (in response to a Company Adverse
Recommendation Notice or otherwise) in determining whether such third party
Takeover Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal. At any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the
Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal that did not result from a
breach of this Section 5.3, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii); _provided, however_ , that the Company shall
pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee as provided in Section 7.3
concurrent with such termination.

  

(d) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

" ** _Takeover Proposal_** " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person or " ** _group_** " (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act),
other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or
indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions) of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
securities of Subsidiaries) equal to 20% or more of the CompanyÂ’s

       

consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the CompanyÂ’s revenues or
earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B) direct or indirect
acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions) of 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result
in any Person or " ** _group_** " (as defined in Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or (D) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; in each case,
other than the Transactions.

  

" ** _Superior Proposal_** " means a bona fide written offer, obtained after
the date hereof and not in breach of this Agreement or any standstill
agreement, to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting
of cash and/or securities, at least a majority of the equity interests of the
Company or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, made by a third party, and which is
otherwise on terms and conditions which the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in its good faith and reasonable judgment (after consultation with
a financial advisor of national reputation) to be more favorable to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders than the Merger and the other Transactions, taking
into account at the time of determination any changes to the terms of this
Agreement that as of that time had been proposed by Parent in writing and the
ability of the Person making such proposal to consummate the transactions
contemplated by such proposal (based upon, among other things,
the availability of financing and the expectation of obtaining required
approvals and any other financial, regulatory, legal or other aspects of the
offer).

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the
Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) from making
any legally required disclosure to stockholders of the Company, in either
case if such Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to so disclose such position would constitute a
violation of applicable Law; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall the
Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or
resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 5.3(c).

  

SECTION 5.4. _ Reasonable Best Efforts._

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to
consummate, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions,
including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect
all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any
required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), and (ii)
obtain all material approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority or
third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions,
including the approvals required pursuant to Section 6.1(d) and 6.1(e). Each
of the parties shall provide the other parties with copies of all filings
made by such party with any Governmental Authority and, upon request, any
other information supplied by such party to a Governmental Authority
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
For purposes hereof, " ** _Antitrust Laws_** " means the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, and all other applicable Laws that are designed
or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

       

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 5.4, (i) the parties hereto shall provide or cause to be provided as
promptly as practicable to Governmental Authorities with regulatory
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Laws (a " **
_Governmental Antitrust Entity_** ") information and documents requested by
any Governmental Antitrust Entity or necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
filing any notification and report form and related material required under
the HSR Act as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement
(and in any event within ten business days thereafter) and thereafter to
respond promptly to any request for additional information or documentary
material that may be made under the HSR Act, (ii) except for the acquisition
of BNG America LLC, Parent and Merger Sub, from the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement,
will not, and will not permit any of ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries to, enter into any
transaction or series of transactions to acquire any Person, or any division
or business of any Person, if the effect of such transaction or series of
transactions would be to materially impede or delay the ability of the
parties to obtain any approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Antitrust Entity
necessary with respect to Antitrust Laws to consummate the Transactions, and
(iii) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take all
action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is
or becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and (y) if any state
takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the
Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions.
The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are
necessary or reasonably advisable to obtain approval of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Antitrust
Entity or otherwise to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act. The parties shall use all reasonable best
efforts to resolve all objections and challenges, if any, that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement under the Antitrust Laws. Subject
to appropriate confidentiality protections, each party hereto shall furnish
to the other parties such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
such other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
Parent or Merger Sub be obligated to propose or agree to accept any
undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any
divestiture, to accept any operational restriction, or take any other action
that, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, could be expected to (1) limit
the right of Parent to own or operate all or any portion of the CompanyÂ’s
business or of Parent to own or operate any portion of their existing
businesses or assets, or (2) require Parent or any of ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries
to license any of their Intellectual Property Rights or to modify any
existing license of their Intellectual Property Rights. In regard to any
Governmental Authority, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall,
without ParentÂ’s prior written consent in ParentÂ’s sole discretion propose,
opine on the advisability of or commit to any divestiture transaction, or
propose, opine on the advisability of or commit to alter any of their
businesses or commercial practices in any way, or otherwise take or commit to
take any action that limits ParentÂ’s freedom of action with respect to, or
ParentÂ’s ability to retain any of the businesses, product or service lines or
assets of, the Company or otherwise receive the full benefits of this
Agreement.

  

(c) Each party hereto shall provide to the other parties (or their respective
advisors) copies of all correspondence between it (or its advisors) and any
Governmental Antitrust Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any of the matters described in this Section 5.4, and, to
the extent reasonably practicable, all discussions, telephone calls, and
meetings with a Governmental Antitrust Entity regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the matters described in this
Section 5.4 shall include representatives of Parent and the Company. Subject
to applicable Law, the parties will consult and cooperate with each other in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf

       

of any party hereto relating to proceedings under the Antitrust Laws, and
shall provide to the CompanyÂ’s or ParentÂ’s outside counsel, as appropriate,
all information and documents reasonably requested by such counsel promptly
upon request, subject to any reasonable restrictions. The parties hereto may,
as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 5.4 as "outside
counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the
recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials of Parent and the Company.

  

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to seek and obtain all
required prior consents from all applicable Governmental Authorities to the
indirect transfer of control of the CompanyÂ’s Permits (including
Environmental Permits), and Parent shall cooperate with the Company in
providing information regarding Parent that is reasonably required for the
Company to obtain such consent. Without limiting the foregoing, during the
period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company
shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and reasonably assist Parent in
identifying the Environmental Permits required by Parent to operate the
CompanyÂ’s business from and after the Effective Time and shall use reasonable
best efforts to either transfer existing Environmental Permits of the
Company, where permissible, or assist Parent in obtaining new Environmental
Permits. Such cooperation and assistance shall include, but is not limited
to, the CompanyÂ’s or its agentsÂ’ attendance at public hearings and, to the
extent necessary, the use of the knowledge, expertise and information of the
Company and its agents, experts and employees.

  

SECTION 5.5. _ Public Announcements; Employee Communications._

  

(a) The initial press releases with respect to the execution of this
Agreement shall be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company.
Thereafter, neither the Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the extent
not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect
to the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions without the prior
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any
applicable listing agreement with a national securities exchange or Nasdaq as
determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to make such
release or announcement (in which case, to the extent practicable, such party
shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other
public announcement without prior consultation with the other party).

  

(b) The Company and Parent agree to use reasonable efforts to provide the
other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any written
communication intended to be broadly disseminated to their respective
employees with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other
Transactions prior to the dissemination of such written communication.

  

SECTION 5.6. _ Access to Information; Confidentiality._

  

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent
and ParentÂ’s representatives, and ParentÂ’s financing sources, reasonable
access during normal business hours to all of the CompanyÂ’s and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ properties, books, Contracts, commitments, records and
correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form, and
including all material environmentally related audits, studies, reports,
analyses, and results of investigations performed with respect to the
currently or previously owned, leased or operated properties of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries), officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other Representatives and to all other information
concerning the CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request.

   

34   

  

(b) The Company shall furnish promptly to Parent a copy of each report,
schedule and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the
requirements of Federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any
communication (including "comment letters") received by the Company from the
SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws.

  

(c) Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of March 7, 2005, between the Company and Goldberg
Lindsay and Co. LLC (as it may be amended from time to time, the " **
_Confidentiality Agreement_** "), Parent shall hold information received from
the Company pursuant to this Section 5.6 in confidence in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement as if Parent were a party to the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

(d) The Company shall permit Parent and ParentÂ’s environmental consultant, to
conduct investigations (including investigations known as "Phase I"
environmental site assessments and compliance audits) of the environmental
conditions of any real property owned, operated or leased by or for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the operations conducted thereat
(subject to any limitations contained in valid, previously executed leases).
Any such environmental investigations shall be conducted by a qualified
environmental consulting firm, possessing reasonable levels of insurance, in
compliance with applicable Laws and in a manner that minimizes the disruption
of the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, neither Parent nor ParentÂ’s environmental
consultant shall conduct any invasive testing (including, but not limited to,
the sampling of any building materials, soil, groundwater or other
environmental media) without the prior written consent of the Company.

  

(e) In order to assist with obtaining the Financings, the Company shall, and
the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide such assistance and
cooperation as Parent and its Affiliates may reasonably request, including
(i) making senior management of the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably
available for lender or proposed financing source meetings, and (ii)
cooperating with prospective lenders and their advisors in performing their
due diligence.

  

(f) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this Section 5.6
will modify any of the representations and warranties of the parties hereto.

  

SECTION 5.7. _ Notification of Certain Matters._ The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company
(which, notwithstanding Section 8.9, may be delivered in the form of oral
notice), of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partyÂ’s
Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to
the Transactions, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which, would cause any representation or warranty made by such
party contained in this Agreement (A) that is qualified as to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect to be untrue and (B) that is not so qualified to be
untrue in any material respect, and (iv) any material failure of such party
to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided, however,_  that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-
compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

  

SECTION 5.8. _ Indemnification and Insurance._

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall jointly and severally indemnify the individuals who at or prior to the
Effective Time were directors or officers of the

       

Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " ** _Indemnitees_** ")
with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at
any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent (A) required by
the Company Charter Documents or Subsidiary Documents as in effect on the
date of this Agreement and (B) permitted under applicable Law. An Indemnitee
shall notify Parent and the Surviving Corporation in writing promptly upon
learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or other
matter in respect of which such indemnification may be sought. In the event
of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (x) each
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of reasonable expenses
incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation from Parent or the Surviving Corporation within ten business
days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified
Party of a reasonably detailed request therefor; provided that any person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification, and (y) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding
or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim (and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnitee hereunder), unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be liable for any settlement or compromise effected without its
written consent. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation and shall furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

  

(b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of individuals who
were directors and officers prior to the Effective Time than are presently
set forth in the CompanyÂ’s Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

  

(c) Parent shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time who are then covered by
the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy currently maintained
by the Company (a correct and complete copy of which has heretofore been
delivered to Parent) to be covered for a period of six years from the
Effective Time by such policy ( _provided_ that Parent may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous in any material respect than such
policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as
such; _provided_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to expend per
year of coverage more than 200% of the amount currently expended by the
Company per year of coverage as of the date of this Agreement (the " **
_Maximum Amount_** ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant
hereto. If notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts to do so,
Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this
paragraph, Parent shall obtain as much comparable insurance as available for
the Maximum Amount. The Indemnitees may be required to make reasonable
application and provide reasonable and customary representations and
warranties to applicable insurance carriers for the purpose of obtaining such
insurance.

  

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.8 applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this Section 5.8. The provisions of this Section
5.8 are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
heirs.

       

SECTION 5.9. _ Securityholder Litigation._ The Company shall not settle
any securityholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors
relating to the Transactions without ParentÂ’s prior consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

SECTION 5.10. _ Control of Company Operations._ Each of the parties
hereto acknowledges and agrees that nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give to Parent, directly or indirectly, any rights to control or direct the
operations of the Company prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision of its and its SubsidiariesÂ’
operations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this paragraph shall
limit the provisions of Section 5.2.

  

SECTION 5.11. _ Fees and Expenses._ Except as provided in Section 7.3,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger
and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or
expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

  

SECTION 5.12. _ Certain Employee-Related Matters._

  

(a) For a period of not less than one year following the Closing, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to provide the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (but only to the extent the employees
continue to be employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries) with a level of
salary, wages, commissions, if applicable, and other employee benefits,
including bonus, incentive and severance which are at least
substantially similar, in the aggregate, to the salary, wages, commissions,
if applicable, and other employee benefits (excluding any equity-based
compensation) provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to such employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date. This Section 5.11 shall not limit any
obligation of the Surviving Corporation to maintain a Company Plan that,
pursuant to an existing contract, must be maintained for a period longer than
one year. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of
continued employment of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and
this Agreement shall not be construed so as to prohibit the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries from having the right to terminate the
employment of any employee of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries.
Following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make
the retention payments to employees which are required by the terms of
severance or employment agreements in effect as of the date hereof.

  

(b) To the extent Parent or the Surviving Corporation does not maintain a
particular Company Plan (other than equity compensation plans) after the
Closing Date, (i) each employee and former employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries will be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities thereof) before
the Closing Date under the parallel employee benefit plan of Parent and its
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting, but not for benefit
accrual, to the same extent as such employee or former employee was entitled,
before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under the Company Plan
(except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of
benefits); and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation ceases to maintain
any particular Company Plan during the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs, each employee shall be given credit for amounts paid by the
employee during such year under the Company Plan towards deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the parallel plan, program or
arrangement of Parent.

  

(c) The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Company
Deferred Compensation Plan effective as of the Closing Date.

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly authorized
by each of their respective Boards of Directors; or

  

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

  

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the date that
is twelve months after the date hereof (the " ** _Walk-Away Date_** "),
_provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this

       

Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to a party if
the failure of the Merger to have been consummated on or before the Walk-Away
Date was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement;

  

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 6.1(c) is in
effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided, however,_
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(ii)
shall not be available to a party if such Restraint was primarily due to the
failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;
or

  

(iii) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment
or postponement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(iii) shall not be available to the
Company if it has failed to comply in all material respects with its
obligations under Section 5.1 or 5.3; or

  

(c) by Parent:

  

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A)
would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b) and (B)
is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the Company within 30
business days following receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach
or failure; or

  

(ii) if a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred; or

  

(d) by the Company:

  

(i) if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of Parent set forth
in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A) would
(if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or (b) and (B) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Parent within 30 business days
following receipt of written notice from the Company of such breach or
failure;

  

(ii) prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval if, concurrently
with such termination, the Company enters into a definitive Company
Acquisition Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal in accordance with
Section 5.3 and, in accordance with Section 7.3, the Company pays to Parent
the Company Termination Fee; or

  

(iii) either (A) the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the
Merger under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated as of the
Walk-Away Date, or (B) any statute, order, decree, ruling, judgment or
injunction shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated, or enforced by

be in effect as of the date of termination of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(iii), (x) making illegal or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger substantially on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement (including, by way of example and not
by limitation, an order or decree by any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction permanently enjoining the consummation of the Merger,
whether or not such order or decree has become final and nonappealable), or
(y) delaying past the Walk-Away Date the consummation of the Merger
substantially on the terms contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right of the Company to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 7.1(d)(iii) shall only be available to the Company if (I) the
Company Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained in accordance with

       

applicable Law and the Company Charter Documents, (II) there shall not have
occurred and be continuing at such time a Company Material Adverse Effect
(which term, for the limited purpose of this Section 7.1(d)(iii), shall
exclude any statute, order, decree, ruling, judgment or injunction of the
type described in clause (B) of this Section 7.1(d)(iii)) and (III) there
shall not have occurred and be continuing at such time any breach or failure
to perform by the Company of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure
would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to
the failure to be satisfied of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
(b).

  

SECTION 7.2. _ Deemed Termination; Effect of Termination._

  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Sections 7.1(b)(i)
or 7.1(b)(ii) and if at such time the conditions to the exercise of the
CompanyÂ’s right of termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(iii) would also
have been satisfied were the Company to have then elected to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(iii), regardless of the satisfaction of
any notice delivery requirement by the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(b)
and without requiring any other action on the part of the Company,
notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement shall instead be deemed to have been terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(iii) for all purposes hereof and for all purposes
under the Disposal Agreement Amendment (defined below), and not by Parent
pursuant to Sections 7.1(b)(i) or 7.1(b)(ii).

  

(b) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section
7.1, written notice thereof shall be given to the other party or parties,
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made,
and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void (other than the
provisions of Sections 5.6(c), 5.10, 5.11, 7.2 and 7.3, 7.4 and Article VIII,
all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement (the " **
_Surviving Provisions_** ")), and there shall be no liability on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective directors, officers
and Affiliates arising under this Agreement, except as set forth in the
Surviving Provisions; _provided, however_ , that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from any obligation or liability arising under
the Confidentiality Agreement or the Disposal Agreement Amendment or relieve

 **ARTICLE VIII**

  

 **Miscellaneous**

  

SECTION 8.1. _ No Survival, Etc._ Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the representations, warranties and agreements of each party
hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of any other party hereto, any Person
controlling any such party or any of their officers, directors or
representatives, whether prior to or after the

       

execution of this Agreement, and no information provided or made available
shall be deemed to be disclosed in this Agreement or in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, except to the extent actually set forth herein or
therein. The representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement
shall terminate at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in
Section 7.2, upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1,
as the case may be, except that the agreements set forth in Article II and
Sections 5.8 and 5.11 and any other agreement in this Agreement which
contemplates performance after the Effective Time shall survive the Effective
Time indefinitely and the Surviving Provisions shall survive termination
indefinitely. The Confidentiality Agreement and the Disposal Agreement
Amendment shall (i) survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with
their respective terms and (ii) terminate as of the Effective Time.

  

SECTION 8.2. _ Amendment or Supplement._ At any time prior to the
Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all
respects, whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by
their respective Boards of Directors; _provided, however_ , that following
approval of the Transactions by the stockholders of the Company, there shall
be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law would require
further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such approval.

  

SECTION 8.3. _ Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of
the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein,
waive any of such partyÂ’s conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right hereunder. No action taken pursuant to this
Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any party hereto,
constitutes a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
provision of this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The waiver by any party
hereto of any provision of this Agreement is effective only in the instance
and only for the purpose that it is given and does not operate and is not to
be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such provision or as a
waiver of any other provision.

  

SECTION 8.4. _ Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent, but no such
assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment
not permitted under this Section shall be null and void.

  

SECTION 8.5. _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall
become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other parties.

   

43   

  

SECTION 8.6. _ Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ Neither
this Agreement nor any of the terms or provisions hereof are binding upon or
enforceable against any party hereto unless and until the same is executed by
all of the parties hereto. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Disposal Agreement Amendment (a) constitute
the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) except for the
provisions of Section 5.8, are not intended to and shall not confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

  

SECTION 8.7. _ Governing Law; Jurisdiction._

  

(a) The laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to its conflicts
of law principles) govern this Agreement and all matters arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including its negotiation, execution, validity, interpretation, construction,
performance and enforcement.

  

(b) The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or any federal
court sitting in the City of New York) over any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and each party hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
courts. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive any objection which they
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding
brought in such court or any claim that such action or proceeding brought in
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a judgment in such action or proceeding may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably consents to process
being served by any party to this Agreement in any action or proceeding by
delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.9.

  

SECTION 8.8. _ Specific Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the
City of New York, without bond or other security being required, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

SECTION 8.10. _ Severability._ If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy,
all other terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable 

       

of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify

 **SECTION 8.13.** _ __Interpretation; Other._

  

(a) When calculating the period of time before which, within which
or following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period is
excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-business day, the period in
question ends on the next succeeding business day. Any reference in this
Agreement to $ means U.S. dollars. The Exhibits and Schedules to this
Agreement are hereby incorporated and made a part hereof as if set forth in
full in this Agreement and are an integral part of this Agreement. Unless the
context otherwise requires, any reference in this Agreement to gender
includes all genders, and words imparting the singular number only include
the plural and vice versa. The provision of a Table of Contents, the division
of this Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and the
insertion of headings are for convenience of reference only and do not alter
the meaning of, or affect the construction or interpretation of, this
Agreement. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this
Agreement to any "Article," "Section," "Schedule" or "Exhibit" are to the
corresponding Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this Agreement. Unless
the context otherwise requires, the words "hereby," "herein," "hereinafter,"
"hereof," and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely
to the provision in which such words appear. The word "including," or any
variation thereof, means "including, without limitation" and does not limit
any general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items
or matters immediately following it. All references in this Agreement to
specific Laws or to specific sections or provisions of Laws, apply to the
respective federal, state, local, or foreign Laws that bear the names so
specified and to any succeeding or amended Law, section, or provision
corresponding thereto. Any reference in this Agreement to the "parties" to
this Agreement means the signatories to this Agreement and their successors
and permitted assigns, and does not include any third party.

  

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question
of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as
jointly drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement.

  

(c) This Agreement may only be enforced against the parties hereto. All
claims or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arising
out of or relating to this Agreement (including the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement and any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) may be made only against the parties hereto. No past, present or
future officer, director, shareholder, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, agent, attorney, representative or affiliate of any party hereto
(including any person negotiating or executing this Agreement on behalf of a
party hereto) (any such Person, a " ** _Non-Obligated Person_** ") has any
liability or obligation with respect to this Agreement or with respect to any
claim or cause of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arising out
of or relating to this Agreement (including the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement and any representation or warranty made in
or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into
this Agreement).

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
duly executed and delivered as of the date first above written.
