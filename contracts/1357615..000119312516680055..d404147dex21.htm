this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, convey, assign and transfer
to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase, acquire and accept, the Transferred Equity
Interests, free and clear of all Liens other than Liens created or imposed by
Buyer and its Affiliates or transfer restrictions arising under securities
laws. Accordingly, Seller shall deliver at the Closing stock certificates
representing the Transferred Equity Interests, together with stock powers
endorsed in blank.

(b) Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Closing, (i) Seller shall sell, convey, assign and transfer
to Buyer or one of its Affiliates designated by Buyer, and Buyer shall, or
Buyer shall cause such Affiliate to, purchase, acquire and accept, the
Transferred Assets, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens
and Liens created or imposed by Buyer and its Affiliates and (ii) Buyer and
such Affiliate shall assume full responsibility for the full performance of,
and shall undertake, assume and agree to perform, pay or otherwise discharge
when due, any and all Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates arising in
connection with or related to the Transferred Assets.

(c) To the extent that the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery
or attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to Buyer of
any Transferred Asset is prohibited by any applicable Law or would require any
governmental or third-party authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers
and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been
obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute a sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery thereof. From the date hereof
until 12 months after the Closing Date, the parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other to obtain promptly such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers and to give any notices
required for the transfer of such Transferred Asset; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller shall not be required to pay any consideration (other than
customary Intellectual Property filing fees typically paid by a seller or
transferee) or make any concession therefor. If such authorization, approval,
consent or waiver is obtained, Seller shall promptly assign, transfer, convey
or deliver any such Transferred Asset to Buyer or its designated Affiliate at
no additional cost. Pending the earlier of obtaining such authorization,
approval, consent or waiver or the expiration of such 12-month period, insofar
as reasonably practicable and to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
Seller shall hold such Transferred Assets for the benefit of Buyer and shall
operate such Transferred Assets in a manner to place Buyer in a substantially
similar position as if such Transferred Assets had been sold, conveyed,
assigned and transferred, and Buyer shall perform, at its sole expense,
all obligations of Seller to be performed after the Closing with respect to
such Transferred Asset. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Seller in connection with any actions taken by Seller pursuant
to this Section 2.02(c). Buyer further agrees that, if Seller shall have
complied with its obligations under this Agreement with respect to using
reasonable best efforts to obtain such authorization, approval, consent or
waiver, Seller shall not be in breach of this Agreement solely as a result of
the failure to obtain any such authorization, approval, consent or waiver.

 



17 SECTION 2.03. _Excluded Liabilities._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall assume or be obligated
to pay, perform or otherwise discharge, pursuant to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions, any Excluded Liability. Seller and its Affiliates will
remain liable to pay, perform and discharge when due, all Excluded
Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, at the Closing, the acquisition of
the Transferred Equity Interests and the Transferred Assets shall not result
in the assumption by Buyer of the Excluded Liabilities. 

SECTION 2.04. _Purchase Price._ (a) The purchase price to be paid by Buyer in
consideration of the sale, conveyance and transfer of the Transferred Equity
Interests and the Transferred Assets and the other covenants and agreements of
Seller contained herein shall be Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000)
(the " _Purchase Price_ "). The Purchase Price (i) as adjusted pursuant to
Section 2.04(c) is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date
Amount_ " and (ii) as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.05(d) is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Final Purchase Price._ "

(b) Not later than three business days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a written statement setting forth Sellers good-faith
estimate of the Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Net Working Capital and the
Closing Date Indebtedness. Such statement, as delivered to Buyer, is referred
to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date Statement._ "

(c) (i) If the Closing Date Net Working Capital as shown on the Closing Date
Statement (the " _Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital_ ") is greater
than $88,100,000 (the " _Working Capital Target_ "), then the Purchase Price
shall be increased by the amount by which the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital Target. If the Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Target, then the
Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount by which the Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Target;

(ii) (x) if the Closing Date Cash as shown on the Closing Date Statement
is greater than the Cash Target, the Purchase Price shall be increased by the
amount of such excess or (y) if the Closing Date Cash as shown on the Closing
Date Statement is less than the Cash Target, the Purchase Price shall be
decreased by the amount of such difference; and

(iii) if the Closing Date Indebtedness as shown on the Closing Date Statement
is greater than zero, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount of
such excess.

(d) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid an amount of cash in
U.S. dollars equal to the Closing Date Amount to Seller (or one or more of its
Affiliates as Seller may designate), in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to one or more bank accounts designated in writing by Seller
at least two business days prior to the Closing Date.

SECTION 2.05. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Determination._ (a) Within
90 calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
Seller a statement setting forth Buyers good faith calculation of the Closing
Date Cash, Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Indebtedness and
any resulting proposed adjustment to the Purchase

 



18  Price, in each case together with reasonable supporting detail with respect
to the calculations set forth therein. Such statement, as delivered to Seller,
is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Adjustment Statement_."

(b) If Seller disagrees with any of Buyers calculations of the Closing Date
Cash, Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness or any
resulting proposed adjustment to the Purchase Price, as set forth on the
Adjustment Statement, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing of such
disagreement within 60 calendar days after delivery of the Adjustment
Statement to Seller (an " _Objection Dispute_ "). Any such notice of an
Objection Dispute shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of the
Objection Dispute so asserted with respect to each item or amount set forth
in the Adjustment Statement and provide reasonable supporting detail with
respect to Sellers calculation of the Objection Dispute. The failure of
Seller to deliver written notice of an Objection Dispute to Buyer within 60
calendar days after delivery of the Adjustment Statement to Seller shall be
deemed acceptance of the Adjustment Statement and the amounts set forth
therein.

 

(c) Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any Objection
Dispute and any resolution agreed to in writing by Buyer and Seller shall be
final and binding upon the parties. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve
all Objection Disputes within 30 calendar days of delivery of written notice
of such Objection Disputes by Seller to Buyer, then the disputed matters
shall be referred for final determination to an independent accounting firm
(the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "). The Accounting Arbitrator shall be Ernst and
Young LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to so act, such
other internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants that
is not the independent auditor of (and does not otherwise serve as a
consultant to) either Buyer or Seller (or their respective Affiliates) as
shall be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller in writing. Once selected, each of
Buyer and Seller shall promptly deliver to the Accounting Arbitrator (with a
copy to the other party) a written statement (an " _Arbitration Statement_ ")
setting forth their current positions as to the amounts underlying each
unresolved Objection Dispute, as of the date of delivery of such Arbitration
Statement. The Accounting Arbitrator shall only consider those items and
amounts set forth in each partys Arbitration Statement and must resolve all
unresolved Objection Disputes in accordance with the terms and provisions of
this Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Accounting Arbitrator to
deliver a written report setting forth the resolution of any unresolved
Objection Disputes determined in accordance with this Section 2.05 within 15
business days following the date of delivery of the Arbitration Statements to
the Accounting Arbitrator. In making its determination, the
Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The
scope of the Accounting Arbitrators determination shall be limited to whether
there were mathematical errors in the Adjustment Statement, whether the
calculations of the Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing
Date Net Working Capital or any resulting proposed adjustment to the Purchase
Price set forth therein were performed strictly in accordance with the
Statement Principles and the definitions contained herein and therein, and
the Accounting Arbitrator is not to make any other determination. The
Accounting Arbitrators determination with respect to any unresolved Objection
Dispute shall be within the range of values assigned by Buyer to such item in
the Adjustment Statement and by Seller to such item in the Objection Dispute.
Such report of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the
parties to this Agreement. Upon the agreement of Buyer and Seller or the
decision of the Accounting Arbitrator, or if Seller fails to deliver written
notice of an Objection Dispute to Buyer within the

 



19  60-day period provided in Section 2.05(b), the Adjustment Statement, as
adjusted if necessary pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, shall be deemed
to be the Adjustment Statement for purposes of calculating the Purchase Price
Adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.05. Buyer and Seller agree that, except
for Sellers indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 10.02(d) with
respect to Indebtedness outstanding and unpaid at Closing that is not
included in the Closing Date Amount or the Adjustment Statement pursuant to
this Section 2.05, the procedure set forth in this Section 2.05 for resolving
disputes with respect to the Adjustment Statement shall be the exclusive
method for resolving any disputes with respect to Closing Date Cash, Closing
Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Net Working Capital and any resulting proposed
adjustment to the Purchase Price set forth in the Adjustment Statement. The
Accounting Arbitrator will determine the allocation of the cost of its review
and report to each party based on the inverse proportion of (x) the portion of
the Accounting Arbitrators determination (before such
allocation) successfully awarded to such party bears to (y) the total amount
of the Accounting Arbitrators determination (before such allocation) as
originally submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator. For example, should the
items in dispute total $1,000 and the Accounting Arbitrator awards $600 in
favor of Sellers position, 60% of the costs of the Accounting Arbitrators
review would be borne by Buyer and 40% of the costs would be borne by Seller.
Seller and Buyer shall pay the fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator
as so allocated. Buyer and Seller agree to execute, if requested by the
Accounting Arbitrator, a reasonable engagement letter in customary form and
shall cooperate with the Accounting Arbitrator and promptly provide documents
and information reasonably requested by the Accounting Arbitrator so as to
enable it to make its determination as quickly and as accurately as
practicable.

 

(d) (i) If the Closing Date Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant
to Section 2.05(b) or (c) (the " _Final Closing Date Net Working Capital_ ")
is greater than the Working Capital Target, then the Purchase Price shall be
increased by the amount by which the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital
exceeds the Working Capital Target. If the Final Closing Date Net Working
Capital is less than the Working Capital Target, then the Purchase Price shall
be decreased by the amount by which the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital
is less than the Working Capital Target;

 

(ii) (x) if the Closing Date Cash as finally determined pursuant to Section
2.05(b) or (c) is greater than the Cash Target, the Purchase Price shall be
increased by the amount of such excess or (y) if the Closing Date Cash as
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.05(b) or (c) is less than the Cash
Target, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount of such
difference; and

(iii) if the Closing Date Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant
to Section 2.05(b) or (c) is greater than zero, the Purchase Price shall be
decreased by the amount of such excess.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Purchase Price Adjustment_ " shall
be an amount (which amount may be a negative number) equal to (i) the Final
Purchase Price less (ii) the Closing Date Amount. If the Purchase
Price Adjustment is a positive number, then Buyer shall pay or cause to be
paid to Seller (or one or more of its Affiliates as Seller may designate) an
amount of cash in U.S. dollars equal to the Purchase Price Adjustment, in
immediately available 

 



20  funds by wire transfer to one or more bank accounts designated in writing by
Seller. If the Purchase Price Adjustment is a negative number, then Seller
shall pay or cause to be paid to Buyer (or one or more of its Affiliates as
Buyer may designate) an amount of cash in U.S. dollars equal to the absolute
value of the Purchase Price Adjustment, in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to one or more bank accounts designated in writing by Buyer. Any
such payment shall be (A) increased by the interest on such amount, at the
rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" as published in the _Wall Street
Journal_ on the business day preceding the date of such payment, compounded
daily, from the date of delivery of the notice of Objection Dispute to and
including the date of payment, based on a 365-day year and (B) made within
five business days after the Purchase Price Adjustment is finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.05.

(f) During the period following the Closing Date through the date on which the
Adjustment Statement becomes final and binding on the parties pursuant to
Section 2.05(b) or (c), Buyer shall provide Seller and its Representatives
with reasonable access during normal business hours to all the properties,
personnel and records of the Business and the Company relevant to the
calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustment (subject to reasonable
confidentiality restrictions and to providing such assurances, releases,
indemnities or other agreements as accountants may customarily require in
such circumstances).

(g) The pendency of an Objection Dispute shall not affect the payment
obligation of either Buyer or Seller, as applicable, under Section 2.05(e) to
the extent of any undisputed portion of any payment to be made by the parties
under this Article II after the Closing. If any portion of the payment is
disputed under this Section 2.05, the Final Purchase Price shall be
calculated on a preliminary basis using only the undisputed items, and to the
extent the Final Purchase Price so calculated is greater than or less than the
portion of the Closing Date Amount applicable to such undisputed items, then
the applicable payment shall be made on a preliminary basis pursuant to
Section 2.05(e) within five business days after the undisputed items have
become final. If a preliminary payment is directed to be made pursuant to
this Section 2.05(g), then, upon final resolution of the Closing Date Cash,
Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Net Working Capital and any resulting
proposed adjustment to the Purchase Price set forth in the Adjustment
Statement, the payment then required to be made in accordance with Section
2.05(e) shall be made, without duplication, after giving effect to the
preliminary payment so paid.

 

SECTION 2.06. _Withholding Taxes._ Seller and Buyer are each permitted to
withhold amounts from any payment made under this Agreement as required under
applicable Law. Any party that determines that applicable Law requires it to
withhold any amounts from any payments made under this Agreement shall notify
the other party as soon as reasonably practicable after making
such determination; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such
notification shall not preclude the withholding party from making the
withholding required by applicable Law. The parties shall reasonably cooperate
with each other to reduce the amount of withholding Taxes imposed on any
payment made under this Agreement, including by executing and filing any forms
or certificates reasonably required to claim an available reduced rate of, or
exemption from, withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent any amounts are withheld from any such payments solely as a result of
designation by Buyer before Closing of any of its rights or obligations
pursuant to Section 2.02(b), Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) such
additional amounts as necessary so that after such withholding has been made
Seller

 



21  receives an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no
additional withholding in respect of Buyers assignment been made. Any amounts
so deducted shall be remitted by the withholding party to the appropriate
Governmental Entity or Taxing Authority and shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the party in respect of which such
deduction was made.

 

SECTION 2.07. _Closing Deliveries by Seller._ At the Closing, Seller shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer (unless delivered previously), the
following:

(i) a certificate of good standing of the Company from the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware dated within two business days prior to the Closing
Date;

(ii) a certificate in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer from an officer
of the Company, dated as of the Closing Date, attaching true and complete
copies of (x) the Companys certificate of incorporation and all amendments
thereto, in effect as of the Closing Date, (y) the Companys bylaws and all
amendments thereto, in effect as of the Closing Date, and (z) resolutions of
the board of directors of the Company authorizing this Agreement and the
Transactions;

 

(iii) the officers certificate referred to in Section 5.01(c);

 

(iv) duly executed counterparts of the Ancillary Agreements as contemplated by
Section 7.09;

 

(v) stock certificates representing the Transferred Equity Interests, together
with executed stock powers endorsed in blank in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Buyer;

(vi) resignation letters, effective as of the Closing, in a form reasonably
acceptable to Buyer, from the directors and officers of the Company and any
managers or officers of the Joint Venture appointed by the Company, as
requested by Buyer at least five business days prior to the Closing Date;

 

(vii) evidence reasonably acceptable to Buyer of the termination of any powers
of attorney executed and delivered or otherwise issued to Seller or any of
its Affiliates by or on behalf of the Company;

(viii) a duly executed certificate of non-foreign status substantially in the
form set out in Section 1.1445-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations certifying
that the purchase of the Transferred Equity Interests and the Transferred
Assets pursuant to the terms of this Agreement is exempt from withholding
pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act;

(ix) evidence reasonably acceptable to Buyer of the termination of any
Affiliate Contracts in accordance with Section 6.06(b); and

(x) two identical IRS Forms 8023 (including attachments), each duly executed
by Seller.

 



22 SECTION 2.08. _Closing Deliveries by Buyer._ At the Closing, Buyer will
deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller or, as designated by Seller, one
or more of Sellers Affiliates (unless previously delivered), the following:

 

(i) the Closing Date Amount;

 

(ii) the officers certificate referred to in Section 5.02(c);

 

(iii) duly executed counterparts of the Guaranty Agreement  MSA; and

 

(iv) duly executed counterparts of the Ancillary Agreements as contemplated by
Section 7.09.

 

ARTICLE III

_Representations and Warranties of Seller and the Company_

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedules (it being agreed that any
matter disclosed in a Schedule with respect to any Section shall be deemed to
have been disclosed with respect to any other Section to the extent its
relevance and applicability to such Section is reasonably apparent from the
wording of such disclosure), Seller and the Company jointly represent and
warrant to Buyer as follows:

SECTION 3.01. _Organization and Good Standing; Capitalization._ (a) Each of

and is in good standing (where such concept is recognized in the relevant
jurisdiction) under the Laws of every other jurisdiction in which Sellers or
the Companys respective ownership of property relating to the Business or
conduct of the Business makes such qualification or authorization necessary
under applicable Law, except in each case where any such failure would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(b) _Schedule 3.01(b)_ sets forth the authorized capitalization of the
Company, the number of shares of each class of capital stock of or other
equity interests in the Company that are issued and outstanding and the record
ownership of such shares or other equity interests. There are no outstanding
warrants, options, subscriptions, convertible or exchangeable securities or
other Contracts pursuant to which the Company is obligated to issue, sell,
purchase, return or redeem any shares of capital stock or other securities of
or other equity interests in the Company,

 



23  and no equity securities of or other equity interests in the Company are
reserved for issuance for any purpose. The Company does not have any
outstanding or authorized stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit
participation or similar rights. There are no voting trusts, stockholder
agreements, proxies or other similar Contracts, including any rights of first
refusal or preemptive rights, in effect with respect to the voting or transfer

of or other equity interests in any Person.

(d) The Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any debt securities of

SECTION 3.02. _Authority._ Each of Seller and the Company has full power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to carry out, or cause to
be carried out, the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Seller and the
Company has, or will have at the Closing, full power and authority to execute
and deliver each Transaction Document (other than this Agreement) to which it
is or will be a party and to carry out, or cause to be carried out, the
transactions contemplated by each of the Transaction Documents (other than
this Agreement) to which it is or will be a party. This Agreement has been
duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of each of Seller and the
Company and has been duly executed and delivered by each of Seller and the
Company and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of each of
Seller and the Company, enforceable against each of Seller and the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (a)
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and (b) the availability
of injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. Each of the Transaction
Documents (other than this Agreement) has been duly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of Seller and the Company, as applicable, and has
been, or will be at the Closing, duly executed and delivered by Seller and the
Company, as applicable, and constitutes or will constitute a valid and
legally binding obligation of Seller and the Company, as applicable,

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally and (ii) the availability of
injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

 

SECTION 3.03. _Title to Transferred Equity Interests and Transferred Assets._
(a) Seller is the record and beneficial owner of all the Transferred Equity
Interests. Seller has good and valid title to the Transferred Equity Interests

clear of all Liens. The Transferred Equity Interests are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

 



24 (b) Seller (or one of its Affiliates (other than the Company)) has good and
valid title to, or a valid leasehold or license interest in or a valid right
to use, as the case may be, all of the tangible Transferred Assets and has the
right to transfer or assign (or cause to be transferred or assigned), in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such title to the owned tangible
Transferred Assets and such rights to the leased tangible Transferred Assets,
in each case, free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens.

 

(c) The Company has good and valid title, or a valid leasehold or license
interest in or a valid right to use, as the case may be, all of the material
tangible assets owned or used primarily by or held primarily for use by the
Company, free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens.

 

SECTION 3.04. _Consents and Approvals; Absence of Violation or Conflicts._
Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents by Seller or the Company, nor the consummation of the
Transactions by Seller or the Company nor compliance with the provisions
hereof or thereof will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any
provisions of the respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws of
Seller or the Company; (b) require any consent, approval, authorization or
Permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity, except
(i) in connection with the Antitrust Filings; (ii) any consent, approval,
authorization or Permit required to be obtained by Buyer or filing or
notification required to be made by Buyer in order to take title to the
Transferred Equity Interests or the Transferred Assets or otherwise operate
the Transferred Assets or the Business, which consent, approval, authorization
or Permit is customary in transactions of the type contemplated hereby; (iii)
any consent, approval, authorization or Permit required to be obtained solely
by reason of Buyers (as opposed to any third partys) participation in the
Transactions; (iv) the ITAR Notice and NISPOM Notice requirements set forth in
Section 6.03(d); (v) any consent, approval or authorization of, or
notification to, a Governmental Entity required pursuant to the terms of a
Government Contract, and (vi) where the failure to obtain any such consent,
approval, authorization or Permit, or to make such filing or notification,
would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Business or reasonably
be expected to have an adverse effect in any material respect on the ability
of Seller to consummate the Transaction; (c) assuming receipt of
the Antitrust Approvals, violate any Law or Judgment applicable to Seller or
the Company, except for any such violations that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or
(d) result in a material violation of or material default (or an event that,
with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would become a material
default) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any material obligation or to loss of a material benefit
under, any Material Contract, Real Property Lease, Material Government
Contract or material Transferred Asset, or result in the creation of any Liens
(other than Permitted Liens) upon any material properties or assets of the
Company or any material Transferred Assets.

SECTION 3.05. _Sufficiency of Assets._ At the Closing, except for services to
be provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement and assuming that
all consents set forth on _Schedule 3.04_ have been obtained, the Company
(and, solely with respect to the Transferred Assets, Buyer) will own or have
the valid right to use all of the properties, assets, services and rights
that are sufficient to conduct, in all material respects, the Business
immediately following the Closing as it is conducted as of the date hereof and
as it is anticipated as of the date hereof to be conducted immediately prior
to the Closing.

 



25 SECTION 3.06. _Real Property._ (a) The Company does not own any real
property.  _Schedule 3.06_ sets forth a true and complete list, as of the
date hereof, of all real property leased by the Company as lessee, or leased
by an Affiliate of the Company as lessee, that is primarily used or held for
use in the operation or conduct of the Business (the " _Leased Real Property_
"). The leasehold estates in all Leased Real Property are free and clear of
all Liens other than Permitted Liens. True and complete copies of each Lease
(including all amendments and modifications) under which the Leased Real
Property is held (each, a " _Real Property Lease_ ") have been made available
to Buyer. Each Real Property Lease is valid, binding and in full force and
effect with respect to the Company or its relevant Affiliate, and, to the
knowledge of Seller, each other party thereto, except as such enforceability
may be limited by (x) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and
(y) the availability of injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. There
is no monetary default or material non-monetary default under any Real
Property Lease by the Company or its relevant Affiliate or, to the knowledge
of Seller, by any other party thereto. None of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Company or any Affiliate that is the lessee under
a Real Property Lease) has received written notice that (i) the Company,
or its relevant Affiliate, is in default under any Real Property Lease and
such default has not been cured or (ii) a party to a Real Property Lease
(other than the Company or its relevant Affiliate) intends to terminate such
Real Property Lease. No employees of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller who
are not Employees of the Business physically work at any of the Leased Real
Property or otherwise identify any Leased Real Property as such employees
regular place of employment.

 

(b) Except to the extent that under the applicable Real Property Lease, the
Company or Seller, as applicable, does not have the obligation for the repair
and maintenance of improvements, equipment, machinery and equipment located
within the demised premises constituting the Leased Real Property and except
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect, all improvements, equipment, machinery and
fixtures located within the demised premises constituting the Leased Real
Property are in good operating condition and repair, have been maintained in
accordance with commercially reasonable standards and are adequate and
suitable in all material respects for the present and continued use and
operation thereof as used or operated as of the date of this Agreement and as
of the Closing Date, ordinary wear and tear excepted. To Sellers knowledge,
there are no pending or threatened condemnation or eminent domain proceedings,
and none of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Company and any
other lessee under a Real Property Lease) have received any written notice of
any such condemnation or eminent domain proceedings, affecting the Leased Real
Property which, if adversely decided, would materially interfere with such
Leased Real Propertys present use in the Business. None of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries (including the Company or any other Subsidiary that is a
lessee under a Real Property Lease) has subleased, licensed or otherwise
granted any third party the right to use or occupy any material portion of the
Leased Real Property.

 

(c) To the knowledge of Seller, none of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Company and any other lessee under a Real Property Lease) have
received any written notice of any outstanding work orders, deficiency notices
or other similar written notices

 



26  of noncompliance issued by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Leased Real Property that require or recommend material work or repairs in
connection with the Leased Real Property. To the knowledge of Seller, each

non-exclusive or multi-source arrangement or relationship; and (vii) the
Company has not made any voluntary or mandatory disclosures to any
Governmental Entity with respect to any material irregularity,

plans and procedures and has taken commercially reasonable measures to protect
the security and integrity of the IT Systems and the Software and data stored
or contained therein or transmitted thereby.

(f) The Company has taken commercially reasonable precautions in accordance

or exclusively licensed by the Company contains any open source, public
source, freeware or other similar Software that requires the disclosure,
licensing or distribution of any source code or otherwise imposes any material
limitation, condition or restriction on the right of the Company or the
Business to use, license, sell, distribute or otherwise exploit, any such
Software or charge for the same.

Listed Plan is not set forth in a written document, have been made available
to Buyer as of the date hereof; _provided_ that, in the case of any Listed
Plan that is in a Contract to which an Employee of the Business is a party,
Seller may instead make available a form or sample of such Contract
accompanied by a listing of the Employees of the Business, to the extent
permitted under applicable Law, who are parties to a Contract substantially
similar to such form or sample Contract. In addition, with respect to each
Assumed Benefit Plan, Seller has made available to Buyer, if applicable, (i)

expected to result in a material Liability to the Company, (i) each Business
Employee Benefit Plan (and each related trust, insurance Contract or funding
instrument) has been maintained, contributed to, funded, operated and
administered in accordance with the terms of such Business Employee Benefit
Plan and in accordance with applicable Law; (ii) no Action (other than any
routine claim for benefits) is pending or, to the knowledge of Seller,
threatened against, the Company, Seller, any of Sellers Affiliates, any
Business Employee Benefit Plan or any employees or former employees of any
such Person, in each case, relating to any Business Employee Benefit Plan; and
(iii) no Business Employee Benefit Plan is under audit or investigation by

(d) Each Business Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination

that would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the Tax-qualification of any
such plan.

(e) No Assumed Benefit Plan is or has since January 1, 2010 been subject to
the minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code, Title IV or
ERISA. The Company has never maintained, established, participated in,
contributed to, been obligated to contribute to or otherwise incurred any
obligation or Liability under, any "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of
Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "). No Assumed
Benefit Plan is a "multiple employer plan" (as defined in Section 413 of the
Code), a plan sponsored by a human resources or benefits outsourcing entity,
professional employer organization or similar vendor or provider, a "multiple
employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), or a

the Code.

 

(f) There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could
reasonably be expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that

or any of its Affiliates.

 

(g) None of the Assumed Benefit Plans provides retiree health or life
insurance benefits except as may be required by Section 4980B of the Code and
Section 601 of ERISA or any other applicable Law or at the expense of the
participant or the participants beneficiary.

 



37 (h) With respect to each Assumed Benefit Plan, to the extent relating to the
Employees of the Business, all material contributions, premiums or payments
required to be made or paid have been made or paid on or before their due
dates (including permissible extensions).

 

(i) Each Business Employee Benefit Plan, to the extent relating to the
Employees of the Business, that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as such term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been
administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms and the
operational and documentary requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations thereunder. The Company does not have any obligation to gross-up,
indemnify or otherwise reimburse any individual for any excise Taxes, interest
or penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

 

(j) Except as would not result in a material Liability to the Company, each
Assumed Benefit Plan that is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the
United States or covers any employees or other service providers of the
Company or the Business who reside or work outside of the United States (each,
a " _Non-U.S. Assumed Benefit Plan_ ") has, to the extent intended or
required to be qualified, approved or registered by or with a Governmental
Entity, been so qualified, approved or registered by or with such Governmental
Entity and, to the knowledge of Seller, no condition exists that would
reasonably be expected to jeopardize such qualification, approval or
registration, as applicable. To the extent required to be funded and/or book
reserved, each Non-U.S. Assumed Benefit Plan is fully funded and/or book
reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions and
does not have material unfunded Liabilities or Liabilities that could
reasonably be or expected to be imposed upon the assets of the Company or
Buyer or any of the Companys or Buyers Affiliates by reason of
such Non-U.S. Assumed Benefit Plan.

(k) Except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.16(k)_, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions (alone or
in conjunction with termination of employment) will, subject to Buyers
compliance with its obligations under Section 8.01, (i) entitle any Employee
of the Business to severance pay or any material increase in severance pay
under any Business Employee Benefit Plan; (ii) entitle any Employee of the
Business to any material compensation or benefit under any Business Employee
Benefit Plan; (iii) accelerate the time of payment, vesting or funding, or
materially increase the amount of, any compensation or benefit or trigger any
other material obligation to any Employee of the Business under any Business
Employee Benefit Plan; (iv) result in any payment of any amount to any
Employee of the Business that could, individually or in combination with any
other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code; or (v) result in the breach or violation of
or default under, or limit Buyers right to amend, modify or terminate, any
Assumed Benefit Plan except, in the case of clauses (i) through (iii), for
arrangements relating to the exercise by an Employee of the Business of any
rights under applicable Law. The Company does not have any obligation to
gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any individual for any excise
Taxes, interest or penalties incurred pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.

to a specified date, in which case on and as of such specified date and, in
each case, disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality",
"material adverse effect" and words of similar import set forth therein),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true

its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or materially impede,
interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Transactions.

(b) Buyer shall have performed and complied in all material respects with all
the covenants and obligations in this Agreement to be complied with and

may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in this Article V to be
satisfied if such failure was caused by such partys breach of any provision
of this Agreement or such partys failure to act in good faith.

evidence as to financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be
reasonably requested by any third party whose consent or approval is sought
hereunder. Subject to appropriate confidentiality protections, each of the
parties hereto will cooperate with and furnish to the other party such

consent or approval is required under a Contract and is sought hereunder.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the parties obligations under Section

connection with any required filings under the HSR Act in no event later than
six business days after the date of this Agreement), Seller and Buyer shall
file, or cause to be filed by their ultimate parent entities as that term is

provide as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information
required under any applicable Laws or otherwise reasonably requested by any

its reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or obtain early
termination, if available, of any applicable waiting periods in connection
with the filings and notifications made by the parties with Governmental
Entities pursuant to this Section 6.03. No party shall voluntarily extend any
applicable waiting period or enter into any Contract with any Governmental
Entity to delay or not to consummate the Transactions except with the
prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Subject to the provisions in
respect of "outside counsel only" materials set forth in Section 6.03(c), each
of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any Antitrust Filing and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental

the other party reasonably informed of its progress in obtaining any Antitrust
Approvals.

written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed)); and (iv) furnish each other upon request with copies
of all substantive correspondence, filings and written communications
between them or their subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity or its respective staff, on the other hand, with respect
to the Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
party shall provide to the other (or the others respective legal counsel)
upon request copies of all correspondence between such party and any
Governmental Entity relating to the Transactions. The parties may, as they
deem advisable and necessary, designate any commercially sensitive materials,
including any documents responsive to Items 4(c) or 4(d) of any required
filings under the HSR Act, provided to the other under this Section 6.03 as
"outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such
materials. To the extent reasonably practicable, all material discussions,
telephone calls and meetings with a Governmental Entity regarding the
Transactions shall include representatives of Seller and Buyer. Subject to
applicable Law, the parties hereto will consult and cooperate with each other
in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments and proposals made or submitted to any Governmental Entity
regarding the Transactions by or on behalf of any party hereto. Buyer and
Seller shall, to the extent practicable, provide each other and their
respective counsel with advance notice of and the opportunity to participate
in any in-person discussion or meeting with any Governmental Entity

other such information and assistance as is required for: (i) both to file

the sale of the Transferred Equity Interests as contemplated herein and
allocations to Government Contracts derived from Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller (other than the Company and the Joint Venture), attorney-client
privileged communication (except solely with respect to the Company and to the
extent that the providing of such access prior to the Closing would not

such information is prohibited by applicable Law) relating to the Business,
and will furnish, at Buyers expense, Buyer and its Representatives during
such period all such information (other than records relating to consolidated,

Representatives to (a) contact any third party doing business with Seller in

written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,

geographical area or by reason of being too extensive in any other respect,
the covenants contained in this Section 6.07 shall be interpreted to extend
only over the longest period of time for which they may be enforceable, and/or

to the maximum extent in all other aspects as to which they may be
enforceable, all as determined by such court in such action.

(other than the guarantees set forth on _Schedule 3.13(a)(ii)_), to be
terminated and released no later than the Closing and make any necessary
filings (including UCC-3 termination filings) in connection therewith or to
evidence any such termination or release. All such payoff letters, releases
and filings shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

SECTION 6.10.  _Books and Records_. On the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver
or cause to be delivered to Buyer all books and records to the extent related
to the Business or the Company (collectively, " _Records_ "), if any, in the
possession of Seller to the extent not then in the possession of the Company,
subject to the following exceptions:

(a) Buyer recognizes that certain Records may contain incidental information
relating to the Business or the Company or may relate primarily to
subsidiaries, divisions or businesses of Seller other than the Business or the
Company, and that Seller may retain such Records and shall provide copies of
the relevant portions thereof to Buyer;

(b) Seller may retain all Records prepared in connection with the sale of the
Transferred Equity Interests, including bids received from other parties and
analyses relating to the Company and the Business; and

7.07(a)(ii), and any consolidated, combined, or unitary Tax Returns for which
the Company was included.

to all Seller Marks and (ii) Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company
from and after the Closing) shall

 



57  have no rights, and are not acquiring any rights, to use the Seller Marks

immediately terminate the rights granted in this Section 7.01 if Buyer or its
Affiliates fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this Section 7.01.

(b) Buyer shall cause the Company to (i) within ten business days following

(c) For a period of 120 calendar days after the Closing Date (the "
_Transition Period_ "), Seller hereby grants to Buyer the non-exclusive right
to permit the Company (solely to the extent it remains an Affiliate of Buyer)
to (i) display signs containing Seller Marks on or near facilities associated
with the Leased Real Property and (ii) use and distribute letterhead and
invoice forms, advertisements and promotional materials, inventory and other
documents and materials containing or bearing any Seller Mark (" _Existing

the Transition Period in a manner consistent with the operation of the
Business immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(d) In exchange for Sellers grant to Buyer of the non-exclusive rights
listed in Section 7.01(c), Buyer shall ensure that during the Transition
Period:

 

(i) the Company informs all other parties to whom the Company displays or
presents any materials bearing Seller Marks or Existing Stock that in the
context of entering into or conducting any contractual relationship, the
Company, rather than Seller, is entering into or conducting the contractual
relationship; and

 

(ii) the Company (A) uses the Seller Marks and Existing Stock only in the form
and manner consistent with which, and in connection with goods and services
of a level of quality equal to or greater than the quality of goods and
services in connection with which, Seller and the Company used the Seller
Marks and Existing Stock immediately prior to the Closing Date and (B)
complies with all applicable Laws and industry practices in connection with
the Companys use and distribution of the Seller Marks and Existing Stock.

 

(e) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the end of the
Transition Period, Buyer shall ensure that the Company (i) ceases use of any
Existing Stock and (ii) removes or obliterates all Seller Marks (or obscures
or overstickers all Seller Marks to render the Seller Marks no longer
visible), including all display signs containing Seller Marks on or near
facilities associated with the Leased Real Property. Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Company) may not thereafter use the Seller Marks or Existing
Stock, except that the Company may at all times after the Closing Date retain,
solely for its internal business purposes, records and other historical or
archived documents containing or referencing the Seller Marks.

 



58 (f) At all times Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, and
Buyer and its Affiliates shall not attempt to or request any other Person to,
(i) use any Seller Mark in any manner, or engage in any other act or omission,
that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to tarnish, degrade or
disparage a Seller Mark or Sellers or its Affiliates business or
reputation, or that is intended to harm the value, reputation or
distinctiveness of or Sellers goodwill in any Seller Mark; (ii) register or
file applications to register in any jurisdiction any trademark, service
mark, trade dress, trade name, domain name, social media user name or other
identifier of source or origin that consists of, incorporates or is a similar

contest the ownership or validity of any of the Seller Marks, including in any
Action.

(g) Seller hereby disclaims all express and implied representations and
warranties concerning the Seller Marks and all responsibility or liability
under this Section 7.01 for claims by third parties after the Closing Date
arising out of or relating to the use of any Seller Marks by the Company.

SECTION 7.02. _Books and Records; Cooperation with Litigation and Financial
Reporting._  (a) For a period of six years after the Closing Date or such
longer time as may be required by Law (i) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, dispose of or destroy any of the books and records of the
Company in the possession of Buyer or its Affiliates relating to periods
prior to the Closing (the " _Books and Records_ ") without first offering to
turn over possession thereof to Seller by written notice to Seller at least 60
calendar days prior to the proposed date of such disposition or destruction
and (ii) upon reasonable advance notice, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, give Seller and its Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours and without undue interruption of Buyers business, to
all Books and Records at reasonable times at Buyers principal place of
business or at any location where any Books and Records are stored, and Seller
shall have the right, at Sellers own expense, to make copies of any Books
and Records.

(b) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, each of Buyer and Seller
shall, and shall cause each of its respective Affiliates to, make available
upon reasonable advance notice and at reasonable times upon written request
any personnel whose assistance or participation is reasonably required in
anticipation of, or preparation for, existing or future Actions,
investigations or claims by a third party in which such party or any of its
Affiliates are involved relating to or in connection with the Company or the
Business.

 

(c) For a period of one year after the Closing Date (or, if longer, for the
time periods, if any, for which pro forma financial information relating to
the Business is required to be disclosed pursuant to Regulation S-X under the
U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), each of Buyer and Seller
shall, and shall cause each of its respective Affiliates to, and shall request
each of its respective independent auditors to, cooperate with the other
party in providing information relating to the Business or the Company for the
purpose of preparing any financial statements or other financial reports that
are required to be filed by such party or its Affiliates with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.

 



59 (d) The requesting party shall reimburse the other party for its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing the covenants contained in this
Section 7.02.

SECTION 7.03. _Financing Cooperation._ On and prior to the Closing, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Companys
Representatives to provide, in each case in a timely manner,
reasonable cooperation and assistance to Buyer in connection with the
arrangement of any debt financing for the Transaction, including, as
reasonably requested, (i) assisting with due diligence activities of any debt
financing sources relating to the financial information of the Company; (ii)
making management of the Company available to participate in due diligence
meetings and marketing sessions; and (iii) providing such certificates and
documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer and its debt financing
sources; _provided_ that nothing herein shall require (A) such cooperation to
the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company; (B) the Company to prepare or deliver any financial statements
or financial information not previously provided to Buyer or required to be
delivered to Buyer pursuant to Section 6.05; or (C) deliver or cause the
delivery of any legal opinions or any certificate as to solvency.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
the Company be required to bear any out-of-pocket cost or expense, pay any fee
or incur any Liability or make, execute, deliver or take any corporate actions
to authorize any commitment, Contract, certificate or document prior to
Closing in connection with any such debt financing. Buyer shall reimburse the
Company for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing the
covenants contained in this Section 7.03.

SECTION 7.04. _Proprietary Information._ (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company may have received proprietary, confidential or other non-public
information (whether written, verbal, electronic, visual or otherwise)
concerning Seller and its Affiliates and their respective businesses,
financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities, including data,
reports, interpretations, forecasts, business plans, documents (including
Leases and other Contracts) and records, financial or otherwise, concerning or
relating to Seller and its Affiliates or their respective customers, vendors
or other counterparties in business relationships, in each case that is
unrelated to the Business (all such information, together with any notes,
analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared
by the Company, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Representatives_ ")
that contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, such
information, the " _Seller Confidential Information_ ")). Prior to the
Closing Date, Seller was routinely supplied with proprietary, confidential or
other non-public information (whether written, verbal, electronic, visual or
otherwise) concerning the Company and the Business and their respective
financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities, including data,
reports, interpretations, forecasts, business plans, documents (including
Leases and other Contracts) and records, financial or otherwise, concerning
or relating to the Company or its customers, vendors or other counterparties
in business relationships, in each case that is related to the Business (all
such information, together with any notes, analyses, compilations, studies,
interpretations or other documents prepared by Seller or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives (collectively, the "
_Seller Representatives_ ") that contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole
or in part, such information, the " _Company Confidential Information_ ").
The Company Confidential Information and the Seller Confidential Information
are collectively referred to as " _Retained Confidential Information_ ".

 



60 (b) To the extent that, in the ordinary course of business following the
Closing Date, Buyer or any of the Buyer Representatives discovers any
information within the Company or the Books and Records that can be readily
identified as Seller Confidential Information, or Seller or any of the Seller
Representatives discovers any information that can readily be identified as
Company Confidential Information, then the discovering party (as applicable)
agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, keep such
Retained Confidential Information confidential, not use such
Retained Confidential Information except as expressly contemplated by any of
the Transaction Documents, and not disclose such Retained Confidential
Information to any Person in any manner whatsoever at any time, in each case
except to the extent required by Law, but in such case only in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 7.04. In the event that disclosure is so
required by Law, the discovering party shall provide the other party with
prompt written notice of any such requirement so that the other party may
seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with
the provisions of this Section 7.04. If the other party determines to seek
such a protective order or other remedy, the discovering party shall
cooperate (and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Representatives to cooperate) with the other partys efforts to obtain such a
protective order or other remedy. If, in the absence of a protective order or
other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the other party, the discovering
party or any of its Representatives are nonetheless, on the written advice of
counsel, required by Law to disclose Retained Confidential Information, the
discovering party or its applicable Representative may, without liability
under this Section 7.04, disclose to, or as required by, the applicable
Governmental Entity only that portion of the Retained Confidential Information
which such counsel advises in writing is legally required to be disclosed
(and any such disclosure shall be made only to such Persons to whom such
counsel advises in writing such information is legally required to be
disclosed); _provided_ that the discovering party must exercise
its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the
Retained Confidential Information, including by cooperating with the other
party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded the Retained Confidential
Information. In the event that the discovering party discovers that any
Retained Confidential Information in written or electronic form is in the
possession of the discovering party or any of its Representatives as set
forth in this Section 7.04, it shall promptly inform the other party and
shall, upon the request of the other party, promptly (and in any event within
10 business days following such request), at the option of the other party
and at the other partys cost, deliver to the other party or destroy all such
written or electronic information, without keeping any copies, in whole or
part, thereof.

 

SECTION 7.05. _Insurance._ Except with respect to Pre-Closing Insurance
Claims, Buyer acknowledges that coverage for the Business under the Business
Insurance Policies and any other insurance policy of Seller will cease as of
the Closing Date and that neither Seller nor its Affiliates will purchase any
"tail" policy or other additional or substitute coverage for the benefit of
Buyer relating to the Business Insurance Policies, any other insurance policy
of Seller or the Business applicable in any period after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding this provision, Seller agrees that Seller or its Affiliates,
as applicable, shall, with respect to any incident that relates to any
damage, impairment or loss of a Transferred Asset or an asset of the Company
that is potentially covered under a Business Insurance Policy in effect prior
to the Closing Date or is otherwise a Pre-Closing Insurance Claim, (a) report
such incident to the appropriate insurer as promptly as practicable and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Business Insurance Policy
after such incident is reported to Seller; (b) include Buyer on

 



61  material correspondence and possible litigation proceedings relating to such
incident; and (c) instruct that such proceeds are paid directly to the injured
party in settlement of any claims relating to such incident, rather than to
Seller or its Affiliates, or, if such proceeds are received by Seller or any
of its Affiliates, pay such proceeds over to Buyer; _provided_ that Buyer
shall notify Seller promptly of any potential claim, shall cooperate in the
investigation and pursuit of any claim, shall have the right to effectively
associate in the pursuit of any claim, including the ability to withhold its
consent to any proposed claim settlement (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and shall bear all reasonable out-of-pocket
expense incurred by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with the foregoing;
_provided further_ that notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Seller and its Affiliates shall be obligated to use only
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any claims that are potentially
covered by the Business Insurance Policies or otherwise constitute a Pre-
Closing Insurance Claim and shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, have any
obligation to commence any litigation or pay any amounts to any person with
respect to any matter potentially covered by any Business Insurance Policy.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller makes no representation or warranty as
to whether any recovery under any Business Insurance Policy will be received
with respect to any particular incident arising before or after the Closing
Date. Buyer agrees that Seller shall have no Liability under this Agreement
or otherwise for any Liabilities in respect of any failures by Buyer to (x)
report in a timely manner or for any delays in reporting by Buyer or its
Affiliates that void any available coverage under Business Insurance Policies,
or (y) recover under any Business Insurance Policy with respect to any
particular claim. As of the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to arrange for its own
insurance policies with respect to the Company. To the extent that, after the
Closing, Seller receives insurance proceeds in respect of losses suffered by
the Company for which a pending or open claim has been filed with the
applicable insurer prior to the Closing (" _Pre-Closing Insurance Claims_ "),
Seller shall remit such proceeds to the Company or to Buyer.

SECTION 7.06. _Payments from Third Parties._ In the event that, on or after
the Closing Date, either party shall receive any payments or other funds due
to the other party pursuant to the terms of any of the Transaction Documents,
then the party receiving such funds shall promptly forward such funds to the
proper party. The parties acknowledge and agree there is no right of offset
regarding such payments and a party may not withhold funds received from third
parties for the account of the other party in the event there is a dispute
regarding any other issue under any of the Transaction Documents. 

SECTION 7.07. _Tax Matters._ (a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns;
Payment of Taxes._ (i) Seller shall prepare and file all Tax Returns required
to be filed by or on behalf of the Company for any Tax period of such entities
ending on or before the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ "). The
Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner that is consistent with
past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law or agreed by the
parties in writing. Seller shall also prepare and file all Tax Returns for the
Company that are required to be included in (or filed with) a Tax Return of
an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group of which
Seller or any of its Affiliates is part for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, which Tax
Returns, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be considered Pre-Closing Tax
Returns.

(A) In the case of any Pre-Closing Tax Return that is required to be filed by
the Company before the Closing Date, Seller shall (1) provide Buyer with

 



62  a copy of such Tax Return for Buyers review within a reasonable period of
time before the filing of such Tax Return (such period to be no less than 30
calendar days with respect to an income Tax Return), and (2) timely file or
cause to be filed such Tax Return with the relevant Taxing Authority.

(B) In the case of any Pre-Closing Tax Return that is required to be filed by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) after the Closing Date,
Seller shall present each such Tax Return to Buyer for Buyers review and
comment within a reasonable period of time prior to the filing of such Tax
Return, such period to be no less than 30 calendar days with respect to an
income Tax Return, taking into account extensions. If Buyer delivers an
objection to Seller, Seller shall consider in good faith any reasonable
comments from Buyer and Buyer shall timely file or cause to be filed such Tax
Return in the form agreed by Seller in writing with the relevant Taxing
Authority and Seller shall pay all Taxes reflected as due on such Tax Return
by the due date thereof. To the extent the parties are unable to reach
agreement on a disputed item and such item is expected to have a material
effect on a Tax Liability of the Company or Buyer for any Post-Closing Tax
Period, then the parties shall submit such dispute to the Tax Matters
Accounting Arbitrator in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
7.07(a)(ii) no later than 20 calendar days after the date of Buyers delivery
of an objection to Seller.

 

(ii) Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns required
to be filed by or on behalf of the Company for any Straddle Period (the "
_Straddle Period Tax Returns_ ") on a basis consistent with the past practices
of the Company, unless a different position is required by applicable Law or
agreed by the parties in writing. With respect to any such Tax Return, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer for review and approval at least 30 calendar days prior
to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return (taking into account any
applicable extensions), a statement setting forth the amount of Tax for which
Buyer is responsible pursuant to Section 10.03(d) and a copy of such Tax
Return, together with any additional information that Buyer may reasonably
request. Buyer shall deliver written notice to Seller within 15 calendar days
after Buyers receipt of such statement and Tax Return either accepting or
objecting to such statement or Tax Return, and, if Buyer shall not have
delivered such written notice within such 15-day period, Buyer shall be deemed
to have agreed to such statement and Tax Return and shall timely file or
cause to be filed such Tax Return in such accepted form with the relevant
Taxing Authority. If Buyer objects to such statement or Tax Return in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, Seller and Buyer shall
attempt to resolve their differences by good faith negotiation to agree on
such statement and Tax Return. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree on such
statement and Tax Return within 15 calendar days after delivery of Buyers
objection to such statement and Tax Return in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence, Seller and Buyer shall jointly request that an independent
accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller (" _Tax
Matters Accounting Arbitrator_ ") make a determination in resolution of any
issue in dispute as promptly as possible. The determinations of the Tax
Matters Accounting Arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive and Buyer
shall timely file or cause to be filed the Straddle Period Tax Return in
accordance with such determinations with the relevant

 



63  Taxing Authority. The Tax Matters Accounting Arbitrator will determine the
allocation of the cost of its review and report to each party based on the
inverse proportion of (x) the portion of the Tax Matters Accounting
Arbitrators determination (before such allocation) successfully awarded to
such party bears to (y) the total amount of the Tax Matters Accounting
Arbitrators determination (before such allocation) as originally submitted
to the Tax Matters Accounting Arbitrator. For example, should the items in
dispute total $1,000 and the Tax Matters Accounting Arbitrator awards $600 in
favor of Sellers position, 60% of the costs of the Tax Matters Accounting
Arbitrators review would be borne by Buyer and 40% of the costs would be
borne by Seller. Seller and Buyer shall pay the fees and expenses of the Tax
Matters Accounting Arbitrator as so allocated.

 

(iii) Unless otherwise required by Law, neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates (including the Company) shall file an amended Tax Return of, or
agree to any waiver or extension of the statute of limitations relating to
Taxes with respect to, the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle
Period without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(iv) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.07(a)(i)(B), all Taxes due and
payable with respect to Tax Returns described in Section 7.07 will be paid by
filer, subject to reimbursement by the other party pursuant to Section 7.07(h)
and Section 10.03(d).

 

(b) _Transfer Taxes._ All Transfer Taxes shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50%
by Buyer. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avail
itself of any available reductions of or exemptions from any such Taxes, and
to cooperate with the other parties in providing any information and
documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions.

 

(c) _Refunds._ Seller shall be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment
from Buyer or any of Buyers Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the
Company from and after the Closing) with respect to, any refund, credit,
offset or other similar benefit received or realized with respect to Taxes
attributable to the Company for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing
Date, including any such amounts arising by reason of amended Tax Returns
filed after the Closing Date. In connection with the foregoing, if Seller
determines that the Company is entitled to file or make a formal or informal
claim for a refund of Taxes (including by filing an amended Tax Return) with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall be entitled, at Sellers
expense, to file or make, or to request that Buyer cause the Company to file
or make, such formal or informal claim for refund, and Seller shall be
entitled to control the prosecution of such claim for refund subject to
Buyers right to participate, at Buyers expense, in any such formal or
informal claim or Tax Proceeding relating to a claim for refund. Buyer will
cooperate, and cause the Company to cooperate, with respect to such claim for
refund, and will pay, or cause the Company to pay, to Seller the amount
(including interest) of any related refund, credit, offset or other similar
benefit received or realized by Buyer or any Affiliate thereof (including the
Company), within five calendar days of receipt (or realization) thereof, and
net of any (i) unreimbursed costs incurred by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
in respect of such refund, credit, offset or other similar benefit and (ii)
any Taxes imposed on Buyer in respect of any such refund. Buyer and the
Company shall be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment from Seller
with respect to, any refund, credit, offset or other similar

 



64  benefit received or realized with respect to Taxes attributable to the
Company for a Tax period beginning after the Closing Date. Buyer and Seller
shall equitably apportion any refund, credit, offset or other similar benefit
received or realized with respect to Taxes attributable to the Company for a
Straddle Period in a manner consistent with the principles set forth in
Section 7.07(d). Any payment between Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (including the Company from and after the Closing), on the one
hand, and Seller and its respective Affiliates, on the other hand, under this
Section 7.07(c) shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
for Tax purposes unless there is no reasonable basis for doing so under the
applicable Tax Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
7.07(c), Buyer shall under no circumstances be required to cooperate with
Seller or file any claim for refund requested by Seller with respect to a
claim that (i) is not more likely than not correct, or (ii) is reasonably
expected to expose Buyer to increased Taxes for any Post-Closing Tax Period.

 

(d) _Straddle Periods._ In the case of any Straddle Period, Taxes shall be
allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period,
in the case of (i) Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real, personal
and intangible property Taxes) on a daily pro rata basis; and (ii) other
Taxes, as if the relevant taxable period ended as of the close of business on
the Closing Date and, in the case of any such Taxes attributable to the
ownership of any equity interest in a partnership, other "flowthrough" entity
or "controlled foreign corporation" (within the meaning of Section 957(a) of
the Code or any comparable state, local or foreign Law), as if the taxable
period of such partnership, other "flowthrough" entity or controlled foreign
corporation ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date (whether or
not such taxes arise in a Straddle Period of the applicable owner).

(e) _Tax Contests._ (i) Buyer shall notify Seller within ten business days of
receiving notice of a Tax Proceeding relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period with
respect to the Company. With respect to any Tax Proceeding relating to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, Seller may choose in its sole discretion (at its expense)
to control any such proceeding, subject to Buyers right to participate (at
its expense and by employing counsel of its choosing) in such proceeding and
Seller shall not compromise or settle any such dispute without first
obtaining the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if such compromise or
settlement would have an effect on a Tax Liability for a Post-Closing Tax
Period. With respect to any Tax Proceeding relating to a consolidated,
combined or unitary Tax Return, Seller shall have the right to exclusively
control any such proceeding and make all decisions in connection therewith.

 

(ii) Except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer shall control all proceedings
with respect to Taxes of the Company for any Post-Closing Tax Period or Tax
Proceeding described in Section 7.07(e)(i) for which Seller chooses not to
control.

 

(iii) Buyer, the Company and each of their respective Affiliates, on the one
hand, and Seller and its respective Affiliates, on the other hand, shall
cooperate with respect to any Tax Proceeding, which cooperation shall include
the retention and, upon request, the provision to the requesting party of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Proceeding,
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to
testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Proceeding. Buyer and Seller
shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the intent of this Section 7.07(e).

 



65 (f) _Section 338 Election._

 

(i) Buyer and Seller shall jointly make, or cause to be made, an election
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any related U.S. state or local
elections and shall deliver to the other duly executed forms, if required, to
effectuate said election for federal, state and/or local Tax purposes, with
respect to the Company.

 

(ii) Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer copies of IRS Form 8883 and a
schedule allocating the Purchase Price among the assets of the Company and
the Transferred Assets (the " _Purchase Price Allocation Schedule_ ") within
90 days after the Closing Date. The Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and any
other form or document prepared or provided by Seller pursuant to this
Section 7.07(f)(ii) shall be reasonable and shall be prepared in good faith in
accordance with Section 338 of the Code and Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder or applicable state Tax Law. Seller and Buyer
agree to consult and resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of
the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and the IRS Form 8883, and to mutually
consent to the filing as promptly as possible of IRS Form 8883, and any
applicable state or local filings, in accordance with the agreement reached by
the Parties.

(iii) In the event Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute within
30 calendar days following the delivery of the copies of such IRS Form 8883
and Purchase Price Allocation Schedule to Buyer, Seller and Buyer shall submit
the dispute to the Tax Matters Accounting Arbitrator consistent with the
procedures for engaging such party as described in Section 7.07(a)(ii),
including with respect to the division of fees.

 

(iv) Seller and Buyer agree to file, and cause their respective Affiliates to
file, all U.S. Tax Returns (if any) in accordance with the Section 338(h)(10)
election and, if there is a mutually agreed upon Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule, such schedule, and shall neither take any position contrary thereto
(unless and to the extent required to do so pursuant to a determination (as
defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar U.S. state or local Tax
provision)) nor modify or revoke any Section 338(h)(10) election. Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate to file Tax Returns or deliver such forms as may be
necessary, and as contemplated by this Section 7.07(f), to effectuate the
Section 338(h)(10) election for purposes of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
The allocation of the Purchase Price as contemplated by this Section
7.07(f) shall be adjusted as necessary to take into account adjustments to
the Purchase Price under this Agreement, including with respect to adjustments
contemplated by Section 2.05, and payments in respect of Section 7.07(h) and
Article X. 

(g) _Miscellaneous._ (i) Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or permit any
Affiliate (including the Company) to, take any action on the Closing Date
other than in the ordinary course of business except (A) as required by this
Agreement or applicable Law; (B) with Sellers consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); or (C) to the extent
such action does not increase a Tax Liability in a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



66 (ii) With respect to the Company, Buyer shall not make or change any
election with respect to Taxes that would reasonably be expected to give rise
to a Seller Tax indemnity obligation under Section 7.07(h) or reduce any Tax
asset of Seller or any of its Affiliates, except for an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and related U.S. state or local elections as provided
in Section 7.07(f).

(iii) Each of Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and provide the other with
such information and records, and make each of its respective Representatives
available, as may reasonably be requested by such other party in connection
with the preparation of any Tax Return of the Company or Seller, insofar as
it relates to the Company, including with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or a Straddle Period, and Buyer shall, within a reasonable period of
time after Closing or after the end of the applicable Tax period, as the case
may be, provide, or cause the Company to provide, data and other Tax related
information necessary to enable Seller to comply with the Tax Return filing
obligations of or relating to the Company, it being understood that the
provision of such data and other Tax related information shall not extend to
providing data or information to which Buyer has no access, or has been denied
access, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, Seller shall not be required to provide Buyer with a
copy of, or otherwise disclose the contents of, any consolidated, combined or
unitary Tax Return; _provided_ , _however_ , Seller shall make available to
Buyer or the Company, as determined by Seller in its sole discretion,
reasonable and appropriate resources, including employees with knowledge of
the Companys Tax Return filings for Pre-Closing Tax Periods filed on a
consolidated, combined or unitary basis, for the purpose of answering
questions and assisting Buyer or the Company in complying with its Tax Return
filing obligations.

(h)  _Indemnity_. From and after the Closing, and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Buyer Indemnitees against and from (i) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to
the Company arising from or attributable to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods; (ii)
any Taxes imposed on the Company as a result of the provisions of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or the analogous provisions of any U.S. state,
local or non-U.S. Law as a result of the Company being a member of an
Affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group prior to the Closing or
Taxes imposed on the Company as a transferee, successor, by Contract or
pursuant to any Law which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring
before the Closing Date; (iii) Sellers share of Transfer Taxes set forth in
Section 7.07(b); (iv) any payments required to be made after the Closing Date
under any Tax sharing, Tax indemnity, Tax allocation or similar Contracts
(other than a Contract, such as a Lease, the primary purpose of which does not
relate to Taxes) to which the Company was obligated, or was a party, prior to
the Closing; or (v) any Taxes arising from, caused by or related to any of
Sellers or its Affiliates actions taken pursuant to Section 6.06. For the
avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding any expiration of the survival of the
Tax representations and warranties, and any Claim with respect thereto, as
provided for in Section 10.01, the obligations of Seller pursuant to this
Section 7.07(h) shall survive until 60 calendar days after the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations

 



67 SECTION 7.08. _Replacement of Credit Support._ Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain or provide, effective as of the Closing,
guarantees, letters of credit or other credit support or financial obligation
assurances in full substitution for (a) each of the guarantees, letters of
credit or similar assurances set forth on _Schedule 7.08_ and (b) any other
guarantees, letters of credit or similar assurances issued or provided by
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller for the benefit of the Company after the
date hereof in the ordinary course of business and in compliance with Section
6.01 or with the written consent of Buyer in its sole discretion (clauses (a)
and (b) collectively, the " _Seller Guarantees_ "), in each case in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Seller and the counterparties thereto or
beneficiaries thereof, and shall obtain the full release of all Seller
Guarantees in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Seller in connection
therewith; _provided_ that nothing herein shall require Buyer to pay money to
effect any such substitution or release. Seller shall in good faith cooperate
with Buyer and provide Buyer all information reasonably requested by Buyer to
facilitate Buyers performance of its obligations under this Section 7.08,
including to obtain such substitute guarantees, letters of credit or other
credit support or financial obligation assurances. Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event that any Seller Guarantees are not fully released at
or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall continue to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain or provide guarantees, letters of credit or other credit
support or financial obligation assurances in full substitution of the
Seller Guarantees as promptly as practicable and Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against and from any and all
liabilities arising out of or relating to such Seller Guarantees, including
the cost of any fees, interest or other expenses incurred by Seller or its
Affiliates to maintain such Seller Guarantees following the Closing and any
liabilities arising out of any claim or demand under any such Seller
Guarantees.

 

SECTION 7.09. _Ancillary Agreements._ At the Closing, Buyer, Seller and
certain of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, shall enter into,
execute and deliver the Transition Services Agreement, the Honeywell Master
Services Agreement and any other Ancillary Agreement necessary to fully effect
the Transactions.

 

SECTION 7.10. _Further Assurances._ If at any time after the Closing any
further action is necessary or desirable to fully effect the Transactions,
each of the parties shall take such further action (including the execution
and delivery of such further instruments and documents including Intellectual
Property assignment agreements) as any other party may reasonably request.

 

SECTION 7.11. _Additional Payments._ Buyer shall make the additional payments
on _Schedules 7.11(a)_ and _7.11(b)_ , if any, in accordance with the terms
and conditions set forth in _Schedules 7.11(a)_ and _7.11(b)_ , and Buyer and
Seller shall comply with the covenants and obligations set forth therein.

 

SECTION 7.12. _Covenant Not To Sue._ Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates and their respective successors and assigns, hereby covenants not
to file, declare, commence or maintain, nor to assist, authorize or grant any
third party the right to file, declare, commence or maintain, any proceeding,
suit or other action, at law or in equity, against KBR, Inc. or
its Subsidiaries (including the Company) for any claim or cause of action
alleging infringement, misuse, misappropriation or other violation by KBR,
Inc. or its Subsidiaries of or under any Business Intellectual Property owned
by Seller or its Affiliates (excluding Seller

 



68  Marks) as of the Closing and not otherwise licensed pursuant to the terms of
the Transition Services Agreement solely for use, practice or
commercialization of such Business Intellectual Property, during the five
(5)-year period immediately following the Closing, in the conduct of the
Business as it is conducted and as it is anticipated to be conducted as of the
Closing, and any natural developments or natural extensions of such Business,
including for clarity, use or practice of such Business Intellectual Property
in the performance of the Master Services Agreement.

 

ARTICLE VIII

_Employees _

SECTION 8.01. _Employee Benefits Matters_. (a) From and after the date hereof
until the Closing Date, Buyer shall consult with Seller and obtain Sellers
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) before distributing any communications to any Employee of the
Business, whether relating to employee benefits, post-Closing terms of
employment or otherwise. Buyer shall provide Seller with advance copies of,
and a reasonable opportunity to comment on, all such communications. At the
request of Buyer, Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and use commercially
reasonable efforts to make available for discussion at reasonable times for
purposes of preparing for the consummation of the Transactions members of the
Sellers de-integration team established in connection with the Transactions.

 

(b) In the event the employment of any Employee of the Business will not
automatically transfer to Buyer or its Affiliates upon the occurrence of the
Closing by operation of Law or pursuant to the transfer of the Transferred
Equity Interests (each, an " _Offer Employee_ "), not less than 5 business
days prior to the Closing, Buyer or one of its Affiliates will
offer employment, effective at 11:59 p.m., local time, on the Closing Date
(the " _Transfer Time_ "), to such Employee of the Business in accordance with
this Agreement, subject to Seller providing Buyer with information necessary
to make such offers of employment. Offers pursuant to this Section 8.01(b)
shall (i) be for a comparable position at the same or a nearby geographic work
location, in each case, to those as of the Closing Date; (ii) be sufficient
to avoid statutory or common Law severance obligations (but other than those
severance obligations that are payable regardless of the terms of the offer)
or severance obligations under the arrangements set forth on _Schedule
8.01(b)_; and (iii) otherwise comply in all respects with applicable Law
(including with respect to compensation and benefits). With respect to any
Offer Employee who, as of the Closing Date, is on approved leave of absence
from work with Seller or its Affiliates (each, an " _Inactive Employee_ "),
Buyer shall offer employment to such individual on the earliest practicable
date following the return of such individual to work with Seller and its
Affiliates and otherwise on terms and conditions consistent with this Section
8.01; _provided_ that such employee returns to work within 180 calendar days
following the Closing Date or such later time as required by applicable Law or
the terms of any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement upon presenting
themselves for duty to the Business. No later than 10 business days prior to
the Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller shall provide
Buyer a list of all Inactive Employees and the projected end date of each
such leave of absence. Following the Closing and while Buyer has obligations
pursuant to this Section 8.01(b), Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of the
occurrence of the end of any such leave of absence. In the case of
any Inactive Employee who becomes a Transferred Employee on a date following
the Closing Date,

 



69  all references in this Agreement to (A) the day following the Closing Date
shall be deemed to be the references to the date on which such individual
becomes a Transferred Employee and (B) the Transfer Time shall be deemed to
be references to 11:59 p.m., local time, on the date that such individual
becomes a Transferred Employee. For the avoidance of doubt, the 12-month
period immediately following the Closing Date referred to in Section 8.01(e)
shall not be extended by operation of the preceding sentence, except as may be
required by applicable Law. In any jurisdiction where the employment of an
Employee of the Business can transfer automatically to Buyer and its
Affiliates upon the occurrence of the Closing by operation of Law (other than
pursuant to the transfer of the Transferred Equity Interests), (x) Buyer and
Seller agree to take, or cause their respective Affiliates to take,
all actions required under applicable Law and all other actions as are
necessary or appropriate such that the employment of such Employee of the
Business will transfer to Buyer or its Affiliates automatically as of the
Transfer Time and (y) in respect of Employees of the Business who are
principally employed in Mexico, such Employees of the Business will be
transferred to Buyer or one of its Affiliates as of the Closing Date through
"employer substitution mechanics."

 

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and as soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than 15 calendar days after
the date of this Agreement, Seller shall provide Buyer with a true and
complete list set forth on _Schedule 8.01(c)_ containing an identification
number, date of hire, position, location, union affiliation, and base salary,
wage rate and bonus opportunity, as applicable, of each individual identified
by Seller as expected to be an Offer Employee, and Seller shall update such
information periodically prior to the Closing Date to reflect new hires,
leaves of absence and employment terminations and any other material changes
thereto and provide copies of such updated lists and information to Buyer.

 

(d) Seller and Buyer intend that the Transactions should not constitute a
separation, termination or severance of employment of any Employee of the
Business prior to or upon the occurrence of the Transfer Time, including for
purposes of any Business Employee Benefit Plan that provides for separation,
termination or severance benefits, and that such employee will have continuous
and uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately after the
Transfer Time, and Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, comply with any requirements under applicable Law to ensure the
same. Buyer or its Affiliates shall bear all the liabilities, obligations and
costs relating to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates from and against, (i) any claims made by any Employee of the
Business for any statutory or common law severance obligations, any other
related legally mandated payment obligations (including any compensation
payable during a mandatory termination notice period and any payments pursuant
to a Judgment of a court having jurisdiction over the parties hereto), and
severance obligations under the arrangements set forth on _Schedule 8.01(b)_,
and for any other claim, cost, liability or obligation (whether related to
compensation, benefits or otherwise), in each case, arising out of or
in connection with (A) the failure of Buyer or its Affiliates to make an
offer of employment to anyone designated by Seller as an Offer Employee
pursuant to this Agreement, or to continue the employment of, any Employee of
the Business or any other individual who is entitled to automatically
transfer to Buyer or its Affiliates upon the occurrence of the Closing by
operation of Law or pursuant to the transfer of the Transferred Equity
Interests, in each case, in accordance with this Agreement or applicable Law
or (B) the Employee of the Business refusal to accept an offer of employment
from (or to commence employment with), or objection to the automatic transfer
of employment 

 



70  to, Buyer or its Affiliates, and (ii) any claims relating to the employment
of any Transferred Employee after the Transfer Time in respect of any act or
omission relating to the employment of any Transferred Employee after the
Transfer Time.

(e) With respect to each Transferred Employee, for the 12-month period
immediately following the Closing Date or such longer period required by
applicable Law (such period, the " _Benefits Continuation Period_ "), Buyer
and its Affiliates shall (or shall cause any other Person providing
compensation and benefits on their behalf to) provide to each such
Transferred Employee (i) no less favorable base salary or wage rates, as
applicable than the base salary or wage rates, as applicable, provided by
Seller and its Affiliates (or any other Person providing compensation and
benefits on their behalf) immediately prior to the Closing; (ii) cash
incentive compensation opportunities that when considered together with the
base salary or wage rates, as applicable, provided under clause (i)
provide such Transferred Employee with compensation that is substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the base salary or wage rates, as applicable,
and cash incentive compensation opportunities provided by Seller and its
Affiliates (or any other Person providing compensation and benefits on their
behalf) immediately prior to the Closing, but excluding the impact of any
equity-based award or growth plan units; (iii) employee benefits under plans,
programs and arrangements that will provide benefits to such Transferred
Employee that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to either (1) the
employee benefits provided by Seller and its Affiliates (or any other Person
providing compensation or benefits on their behalf) immediately prior to the
Closing or (2) the employee benefits generally made available to other
similarly situated employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates, excluding any
benefits not made available to newly hired employees of Buyer or
its Affiliates; and (iv) an office within a commute of no more than 50 miles
from his or her office as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, in each
case subject to applicable Law; _provided_ that if a relocation beyond that
distance is required and such employees employment terminates as a result of
his desire not to accept such a relocation, such employee shall receive from
Buyer the severance benefits at the level set forth in Section 8.01(g);
_provided further_ that, in the case of clauses (i) through (iii), Buyer
shall comply with any additional requirements in order to avoid a claim of
separation, termination or severance of employment under applicable Law or any
Collective Bargaining Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contemplated by this Agreement shall be construed as requiring either Buyer or
any of its Affiliates to continue the employment of any Transferred Employee
for any period after the Closing Date;  _provided_ that such employee shall
receive from Buyer the severance benefits set forth in, and in accordance
with, Section 8.01(g).

 

(f) As of the Closing, Buyer shall assume and honor or cause its Affiliates to
assume and honor, in accordance with their terms, all obligations with
respect to the bonus amounts payable to Transferred Employees under each
incentive plan maintained by Seller or its Affiliates as described on
_Schedule 8.01(f)_ with respect to the performance period in which the
Closing occurs, provided that, with respect to the portion of any such bonus
amounts related to periods on or prior to the Closing Date, solely to the
extent taken into account as a Current Liability in the calculation of Closing
Date Net Working Capital (the " _Assumed Payments_ "). Such Assumed Payments
shall be determined in accordance with the terms of _Schedule 8.01(f)_;
_provided_ that the employer portion of any employment Tax related to the
portion of the Assumed Payments that relate to periods on or prior to the
Closing Date shall also be taken into account as a Current Liability in the
calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital. Buyer and Seller

 



71  agree that for Tax purposes, (A) Assumed Payments that are taken into
account as a Current Liability in the calculation of Closing Date Net Working
Capital, and the employer portion of any employment Tax related to such
Assumed Payments, shall be deemed to be paid by Buyer acting on behalf of
Seller, (B) Seller rather than Buyer shall be the party that will take a Tax
deduction in respect of such amounts and (C) such amounts do not represent an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

(g) With respect to each Transferred Employee terminated during the Benefits
Continuation Period (other than for cause, as reasonably determined by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates), Buyer or its Affiliates shall provide severance or
termination benefits to each such Transferred Employee that are no less
favorable than those severance or termination benefits applicable to each
such Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, as set
forth on _Schedule 8.01(g)_.

 

(h) With respect to each Transferred Employee, effective from and after the
Transfer Time, Buyer and its Affiliates shall (i) recognize, for all purposes
(other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) under all
plans, programs and arrangements established or maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates for the benefit of such Transferred Employees, service with Seller
and its Affiliates prior to the Closing to the extent such service was
recognized under the corresponding Business Employee Benefit Plan covering
such Transferred Employee, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit levels and accruals (other than benefit accrual under a defined
benefit pension plan), in each case, except where it would result in a
duplication of benefits, (ii) use commercially reasonably efforts to waive any
pre-existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting
period under all employee health and other welfare benefit plans established
or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates for the benefit of the Transferred
Employees, except to the extent such pre-existing condition,
exclusion, requirement or waiting period would have applied to such
individual under the corresponding Business Employee Benefit Plan and (iii)
use commercially reasonably efforts to provide full credit for any co-
payments, deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to the
Closing for the plan year in which the Closing occurs. To the extent any
Transferred Employee receives compensation or benefits from another Person on
behalf of Buyer and its Affiliates, Buyer and its Affiliates will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Person to comply with the
requirements of this Section 8.01(h) as if such compensation or benefits were
provided pursuant to plans, programs or arrangements established or maintained
by Buyer and its Affiliates.

(i) If any Employee of the Business requires a work permit or employment pass
or other legal or regulatory approval for his employment with Buyer or its
Affiliates, both Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any such permit, pass or other approval to be obtained and in effect
prior to the Transfer Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law or any Collective Bargaining Agreement, in the
event an applicable work permit for an Employee of the Business is not
in place with Buyer or its Affiliate as of the Transfer Time, such Employee
of the Business shall be treated as an Inactive Employee hereunder and the
parties shall reasonably cooperate to provide for the services of such
Employee of the Business to be made available exclusively to Buyer through an
employee secondment, services or similar arrangement under which Buyer shall
be responsible for all the

 



72  economic costs of such individuals compensation and benefits (including
reimbursement for any expenses incurred by such Employee of the Business, all
applicable fees, Taxes and other amounts owed to third parties and all
applicable social or national insurance contributions) for such service period
until the applicable work permit can be obtained; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that both Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to,
continue to cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the applicable work permit.

(j) For the Benefits Continuation Period, Buyer shall assume and honor, in
accordance with the terms of the applicable policy of Seller or its applicable
Affiliate, all vacation days and other paid time off accrued but not yet taken
by the Transferred Employees in or prior to the applicable accrual period in
which the Closing Date occurs (including any non-forfeitable grandfathered
vacation bank otherwise payable only upon termination of employment) that are
included as Current Liabilities as of the Closing Date (the " _Accrued
Vacation Days_ "), for which payout as of the Closing Date is not required by
applicable Law. To the extent that a Transferred Employee is entitled under
applicable Law to be paid for any Accrued Vacation Days in connection with
the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates shall pay any such required amounts to
such Transferred Employee.

 

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, from and after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) honor all obligations under any Collective
Bargaining Agreement in accordance with its terms to the extent applicable to
the Transferred Employees, including all compensation and benefit obligations
in relation to service for periods after the Transfer Time, and (ii)
recognize the unions or other applicable representative body that are party to
the Collective Bargaining Agreements with respect to the Transferred
Employees.

 

(l) (i) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to assume all employment, labor, compensation, employee welfare
and employee benefits related Liabilities, commitments, claims and losses that
are included in Current Liabilities or that relate to each (A) Transferred
Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary of any Transferred Employee) that
(1) arise as a result of an event or events that occur after the Transfer Time
(except for such Liabilities, commitments, claims and losses set forth on
_Schedule 1.01(c)_); (2) Buyer or its Affiliates have specifically agreed to
assume, fulfill, bear, honor or be responsible for pursuant to this Agreement;
or (3) transfer to Buyer or its Affiliates under applicable Law (or pursuant
to the transfer of the Transferred Equity Interests) (except for
such Liabilities, commitments, claims and losses described in the definition
of Excluded HR Liabilities); (B) Employee of the Business (or any dependent or
beneficiary of any such employee) who does not become a Transferred Employee
as contemplated by this Agreement as a result of a breach by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates of applicable Law, any Collective Bargaining Agreement or this
Agreement that arise as a result of such breach; or (C) Assumed Benefit Plan
(such Liabilities, commitments, claims and losses, the " _Transferred HR
Liabilities_ ");

(ii) Except as specifically provided in this Agreement (including with
respect to the Transferred HR Liabilities), neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall assume or be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise
discharge, and Seller and its Affiliates, as the case may be, will
remain liable to pay, perform and discharge when due all employment, labor,
compensation, pension, employee welfare and employee benefits (including

 



73  defined benefit pension and retiree welfare benefits) related Liabilities,
commitments, claims and losses, including with respect to any Business
Employee Benefit Plan, relating to (A) each employee of Seller and its
Affiliates, including all former Employees of the Business (or any dependent
or beneficiary of any such employee), other than the Transferred Employees and
their dependents and beneficiaries, in each case, that arise out of an event
or events that occur at any time; (B) each Offer Employee (or any dependent or
beneficiary of any Offer Employee) that arise as a result of an event or
events that occur as of or prior to the Transfer Time; (C) Business Employee
Benefit Plans that are not Assumed Benefit Plans; (D) all Controlled Group
Liabilities; (E) with respect to defined benefit pension and retiree welfare
benefits, each Transferred Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary of
any Transferred Employee) that arise out of any event or events that occur as
of or prior to the Transfer Time; and (F) each Transferred Employee (or any
dependent or beneficiary of any Transferred Employee) that arise out of any
event or events that occur as of or prior to the Transfer Time and arise from
Sellers policies or practices to the extent that such policies or practices
are in violation of applicable Law (such Liabilities, commitments, claims and
losses, the " _Excluded HR Liabilities_ );

(iii) Seller shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates to be, responsible for
all (i) medical, vision, dental and prescription drug claims for expenses
incurred by any Transferred Employee or his dependents, (ii) claims for short-
term and long-term disability income benefits incurred by any Transferred
Employee and (iii) claims for group life, travel and accident, and accidental
death and dismemberment insurance benefits incurred by any Transferred
Employee, in each case, as of or prior to the Transfer Time. Buyer shall be,
or shall cause its Affiliates to be, responsible for all (A) medical, vision,
dental and prescription drug claims for expenses incurred by any Transferred
Employee or his dependents, (B) claims for short-term and long-term disability
income benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee and (C) claims for group
life, travel and accident, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance
benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee, in each case, after the
Transfer Time. Except in the event of any claim for workers compensation
benefits, for purposes of this Agreement, the following claims and liabilities
shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (1) medical, vision, dental and/or
prescription drug benefits (including hospital expenses), upon provision of
the services, materials or supplies comprising any such benefits and (2)
short- and long-term disability, life, accidental death and dismemberment and
business travel accident insurance benefits, upon the death, illness, injury
or accident giving rise to such benefits.

(iv) Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all claims for
workers compensation benefits that are incurred as of or prior to the
Transfer Time by any Transferred Employee. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be
responsible for all claims for workers compensation benefits that are incurred
after the Transfer Time by any Transferred Employee. A claim for workers
compensation benefits shall be deemed to be incurred when the event giving
rise to the claim (the " _Workers Compensation Event_ ") occurs. If the
Workers Compensation Event occurs over a period both preceding and following
the Transfer Time, the claim shall be the joint responsibility and liability
of Seller and Buyer and shall be equitably apportioned between Seller and
Buyer based upon the relative periods of time that the Workers Compensation
Event transpired preceding and following the Transfer Time.

 



74 (v) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller shall be permitted to
make and retain copies of any personnel files or other records relating to
the Excluded HR Liabilities. Without limiting the generality of Section 7.02,
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates
(including the Company) to, reasonably cooperate with, and provide reasonable
assistance to, Seller and its Affiliates in connection with, or in preparation
for, existing or future Actions, investigations or claims by a third party
with respect to the Excluded HR Liabilities.

(m) No later than the Closing Date, Buyer shall establish or cause to be
established, at its own expense, all employee benefit plans for Transferred
Employees as are necessary to comply with Buyers obligations pursuant to this
Section 8.01, as applicable. Effective as of the Closing, each Transferred
Employee shall cease to participate in any Business Employee Benefit Plan
(other than any Assumed Benefit Plan) as an active employee.

(n) To the extent applicable, the parties hereto acknowledge the application
of the European Council Directive of March 12, 2001 (2001/23/EC) (the "
_Directive_ "), relating to the safeguarding of employees rights in the event
of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses and any
country legislation implementing the Directive and any other similar Law
(collectively, the " _Transfer Regulations_ "). Buyer shall take all such
actions that may be necessary or required in order to cause the Transfer
Regulations to apply to the Transactions, and Buyer shall refrain from taking
any action that could cause the Transfer Regulations not to apply to the
Transactions. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that they shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, comply with the Transfer
Regulations to the extent applicable.

(o) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, undertake all provision
of information and documentation to, and consultations, discussions or
negotiations with, any unions, work councils and other employee
representatives which represent Employees of the Business (collectively, the
" _Employee Representatives_ ") to the extent required by applicable Law in
connection with the Transactions. To the extent required by applicable Law,
Buyer and its Affiliates shall cooperate with respect to the foregoing,
including by providing such information and documentation as Seller and its
Affiliates or any Employee Representative may reasonably request.

 

(p) Seller shall take all action necessary to fully vest any Transferred
Employee in any unvested amounts in the Sellers Savings and Ownership Plan
as of or prior to the Transfer Time.

(q) The provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to any Employee of
the Business are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right in any other Person, including any
Employee of the Business (or dependent or beneficiary of any of the
foregoing). Nothing herein shall be deemed an amendment of any plan providing
benefits to any employee of the Company, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates.

SECTION 9.01. _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

(b) by either Seller or Buyer:

(ii) if any Legal Impediment shall be in effect and shall have become final
and non-appealable;

 

(c) by Seller, if Buyer breaches or fails to perform any of its

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

 

SECTION 9.02. _Procedure for Termination._ In the event of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, written notice thereof shall be

SECTION 9.03. _Effect of Termination._ If this Agreement is terminated

bound by the Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any party from
Liability for Damages incurred or suffered by any other party as a result of
any fraud, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement prior to
such termination.

 



76 ARTICLE X

 

 _Indemnification_

SECTION 10.01. _Survival._ All representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement, and any Claim with respect thereto, shall survive the Closing
until the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date, and shall then expire
and be of no force or effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.17 shall survive the
Closing until the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date, and then
shall expire and be of no force or effect and (b) the Seller Fundamental
Representations shall survive indefinitely. The covenants and agreements that
by their nature are required to be performed by or prior to the Closing, and
any Claim with respect thereto, shall survive the Closing until the date that
is 12 months after the Closing Date and shall then expire and be of no force
or effect. All other covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement
shall survive indefinitely except as otherwise specified herein. Any
representation, warranty or covenant that is the subject of any Claim with
respect to which notice is delivered by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period
set forth in this Section 10.01 shall survive with respect to such Claim
until such Claim is fully and finally resolved.

SECTION 10.02.  _Indemnification by Seller._ In addition to the
indemnification set forth in Section 7.07, from and after the Closing, Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees against and from any
and all Damages that any Buyer Indemnitee may incur or suffer to the extent
such Damages arise out of or result from (a) the breach of any representation
or warranty made by Seller or the Company in this Agreement (or any
certificate delivered by Seller or the Company pursuant to this Agreement),
(b) the breach by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including solely to the
extent on or prior to the Closing, the Company) of any covenant or agreement
of Seller or, solely with respect to the covenants and agreements that by
their nature are required to be performed by or prior to the Closing, the
Company, contained in this Agreement, (c) any of the Excluded Liabilities; (d)
Indebtedness of the Company outstanding and unpaid as of the Closing (
_provided_ that (i) in no event shall Seller have any indemnification
obligation pursuant to this Section 10.02(d) or otherwise with respect to any
amounts taken into account in any adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Article II and (ii) the indemnification obligation of Seller
pursuant to this Section 10.02(d) shall expire and be of no further force or
effect on the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date) or (e) Sellers
share of Transfer Taxes set forth in Section 7.07(b). Buyer shall take, and
shall cause the other Buyer Indemnitees to take, all commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate any Damages upon becoming aware of any event that would
reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto. For purposes of
Section 3.18 and Section 3.09, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Seller shall have no liability for Taxes of the Company arising in or
attributable to a Post-Closing Tax Period.

SECTION 10.03. _Indemnification by Buyer._ In addition to the indemnification
set forth in Sections 7.08 and 8.01, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees against and from any and
all Damages that any Seller Indemnitee may incur or suffer to the extent such
Damages arise out of or result from (a) the breach of any representation or
warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement (or any certificate delivered by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement), (b) the breach by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates

 



77  (including after the Closing the Company) of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, (c) except for Claims subject to indemnification
by Seller pursuant to Section 10.02 (after taking into account the
limitations set forth in Section 10.04), any Liabilities, whether arising
before or after the Closing, of the Company, or (d)(i) any Tax liabilities of
the Company, other than any such Tax liabilities that Seller must indemnify
or hold harmless Buyer Indemnitees against or from under Section 7.07 or
10.02, and (ii) Buyers share of Transfer Taxes set forth in Section 7.07(b).
Seller shall take, and shall cause the other Seller Indemnitees to take, all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages upon becoming aware of
any event that would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

 

SECTION 10.04. _Scope of Liability._ The rights of the Buyer Indemnitees and
the Seller Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to this Article X are
subject to the following:

(a) Indemnification shall be available to the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller
Indemnitees under Section 10.02(a) or Section 10.03(a) (as applicable) only
to the extent the aggregate amount of Damages otherwise due to the Buyer
Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, respectively, for all Claims under
Section 10.02(a) or Section 10.03(a) (as applicable) for such indemnification
exceeds $2,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ ") and then indemnification shall be
available to the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, respectively,
for the amount of all payments due to the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller
Indemnitees, respectively, in excess of the Deductible, but only for Damages
in excess of the Deductible up to $30,000,000. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall
have any liability under Section 10.02(a) or Section 10.03(a) (as applicable)
for any individual item where the Damages relating thereto (aggregating the
Damages arising out of or resulting from the same or related facts, events or
circumstances) are less than $30,000, _provided_ that such items shall be
aggregated and included for purposes of satisfying the Deductible. The
limitations on Sellers indemnification obligations in this Section 10.04(a)
shall not apply to Claims for indemnification by any Buyer Indemnitee in
respect of the inaccuracy or breach of any of the Seller Fundamental
Representations. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations in this Section
10.04(a) shall not apply to any claims for indemnification pursuant to
Section 7.07(h). Solely for purposes of determining the amount of Damages
resulting from any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, for
purposes of determining whether any inaccuracy or breach of such
representations and warranties has occurred), the determination shall, in each
case, be made without references to the terms "material,"
"materiality," "Material Adverse Effect," "material adverse effect" or other
similar qualifications as to materiality contained or incorporated in any such
representation or warranty.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) indemnification shall be available to
the Buyer Indemnitees under Section 10.02(a) and (b) only to the extent the
aggregate amount of Damages due to the Buyer Indemnitees for all such Claims
for such indemnification does not exceed the Final Purchase Price and (ii)
indemnification shall be available to the Buyer Indemnitees under
Section10.02(a) for a breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller
or the Company in Section 3.17 of this Agreement as set forth on Schedule
10.04(b).

 

(c) The right of the Indemnitees to seek indemnification pursuant to this
Article X shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of the fact that,
based on any facts or circumstances known, or that should have been known, to
Seller, Buyer or any other Indemnitee,

 



78  including from any investigation made by or on behalf of such Indemnitee,
the information provided in the Management Presentation, the Data Room or
given in writing to such Indemnitee prior to the date of this Agreement
(except, for the avoidance of doubt, any disclosure of any fact or item in any
portion of the Disclosure Schedules), such Indemnitee or any of its
Representatives knew or should have known that any representation or warranty
is, was or might be inaccurate.

SECTION 10.05. _Claims._ Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee claiming it
may be entitled to indemnification under this Article X or Section 7.07(h)
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give written notice as promptly as
practicable to the other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of each Claim.
Such notice shall contain, with respect to each Claim, such facts and
information as are then reasonably available, including the estimated amount
of Damages and the basis for indemnification hereunder. Failure to give prompt
notice of a Claim hereunder shall not affect the Indemnifying Partys
obligations hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Party, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following such Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all written
notices and documents (including any court papers) received by such
Indemnified Party relating to a third-party Claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Claims that are Tax Proceedings relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period with respect to the Company shall be governed by the terms of Section
7.07(e) and not this Section 10.05.

 

SECTION 10.06. _Defense of Actions._ (a) The Indemnified Party shall permit
the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys option and expense, to
assume the complete defense of any Claim based on any Action or Claim by any
third party within 60 calendar days of receipt of notice of such Claim by the
Indemnifying Party with full authority to conduct such defense,
through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the expense
of the Indemnifying Party, and to settle or otherwise dispose of the same and
the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate in such defense; _provided_
that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense
of any third-party Claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party if such
third-party Claim (x) seeks an injunction or other equitable or non-monetary
relief against the Indemnified Party (other than equitable or non-monetary
relief that is incidental to monetary damages as the primary relief sought)
and not also against the Indemnifying Party or (y) is related to or otherwise
arises in connection with any criminal matter, in which case the Indemnified
Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to
participate in such defense with its own counsel and at its own expense, and
(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, in defense of any such Claim, except
with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that in the
case of the immediately following clause (A), such consent shall be in the
Indemnified Partys sole discretion), consent to the entry of any Judgment or
enter into any settlement which (A) provides for any relief other than the
payment of monetary damages, (B) does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the third-party claimant to the Indemnified Party of a
release from all Liability in respect thereof or (C) includes any admission of
wrongdoing or misconduct by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such defense, settlement
or disposal through counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ that
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified Party.
If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any third-party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement of such
Claim for the payment

 



79  of monetary damages unless (1) the Indemnified Party consents in writing to
such settlement, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, or (2) the Indemnifying Party confirms in writing to the Indemnified
Party that the Indemnifying Party will be responsible for indemnifying the
Indemnified Party for the Damages resulting from such Claim, to the extent
provided in (and subject to the limitations on liability and parameters of)
this Article X. After notice to the Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying
Partys election to assume the defense of any Claim in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable to the
Indemnified Party only for such legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof at the request
of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to employ one separate co-counsel and to participate in the defense
of any Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs
and expenses of such separate counsel, if, based on advice of counsel, there
exists an actual or potential conflict of interest between the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of the third-
party Claim. As to those third-party Actions or Claims with respect to which
the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume control of the defense, the
Indemnified Party will afford the Indemnifying Party an opportunity to
participate in such defense, at its cost and expense, and will consult with
the Indemnifying Party prior to settling or otherwise disposing of any of the
same. The Indemnified Party will not settle any third-party Action or claim
without the prior consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In any event, the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party and their respective counsel shall cooperate
in the defense of any third-party Claim subject to this Article X and keep
each other informed of all significant developments relating to any such
third-party Claim, and, upon written request, provide copies of all relevant
correspondence.

(b) _Limitation, Exclusivity, No Duplicate Recovery._ No Claim shall be made
or have any validity unless the Indemnified Party shall have given written
notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying Party prior to the date set forth in
Section 10.01 for such Claim. Subject to Section 11.15, this Article X and
Section 7.07 provide the exclusive means by which a party may assert and
remedy claims of any nature whatsoever relating to the Transactions (other
than disputes related to the Purchase Price Adjustment, which shall be
governed by the terms of Section 2.05) following the Closing, including any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, and Section
11.19 provides the exclusive means by which a party may bring Actions against
the other party under or with respect to this Agreement. Each party hereby
waives and releases any other remedies or claims (including any rights
of contribution or recovery under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act or otherwise under Environmental Laws) that it
may have against the other party (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to
the matters arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or relating
to the Transactions, except that any limitations herein shall not apply (i) to
the remedies of injunctive relief or specific performance set forth herein;
(ii) in the event of fraud or willful misconduct, as to which the parties
shall have all remedies available at Law or in equity; (iii) with respect to
the covenants and agreements that by their respective terms anticipate
performance following the Closing Date; and (iv) as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement (including in Sections, 7.07, 7.08 and 8.01) or any
Ancillary Agreements. With respect to any Damages arising under this
Agreement, Buyer agrees that it shall only seek such Damages from Seller or
any of its Affiliates that transfer Transferred Assets to Buyer or the
Company, and Buyer hereby waives

 



80  the right to seek Damages from or equitable remedies, such as injunctive
relief, against any other Affiliate of Seller or any director, officer,
employee or other Representative of Seller (or any of its Affiliates).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall any
Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification under this Article X or
Section 7.07 with respect to any matter to the extent that such matter
was reflected in the calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustment pursuant to
Section 2.05 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any payroll tax,
employment tax or other item included as a Current Liability in calculating
Closing Date Net Working Capital). For the avoidance of doubt, any indemnity
provided hereunder by Seller shall be so applied as to avoid any double
counting and no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to obtain indemnification
more than once for the same matter or Damages. 

SECTION 10.07. _Calculation of Damages._ Except as otherwise provided in this
Article X, in any case where the Indemnified Party subsequently recovers from
third parties any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an
Indemnifying Party has indemnified it pursuant to this Article X, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the
amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses
incurred by it in procuring such recovery and the related increase in
insurance premium), but not in excess of any amount previously so paid by the
Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of
such matter. The computation of the amount of any indemnity payment required
to be made pursuant to this Article X shall be reduced by the amount of the
Tax benefit resulting from the incurrence of the liability giving rise to the
Damages at issue, if any, actually realized by the Indemnified Party in the
year such liability is incurred or in the immediately succeeding year.

 

SECTION 10.08. _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments._ Any indemnity payment
under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
for Tax purposes unless there is no reasonable basis for doing so under the
applicable Tax Law. Each party shall notify the other party if it receives
notice that any Taxing Authority proposes to treat any indemnification payment
as other than an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, or if a
party otherwise determines that an indemnification payment is required by
applicable Tax Law to be treated as other than an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for Tax purposes. 

ARTICLE XI

_Miscellaneous _

SECTION 11.01. _Buyer s Own Due Diligence._ Buyer has conducted its own
investigation, examination and valuation of the Company and the Business in
effecting the Transactions. Buyer has made all inspections and investigations
of the Company and the Business deemed necessary or desirable by Buyer. Buyer
is purchasing the Transferred Equity Interests and the Transferred Assets
based on the results of Buyers inspections and investigations, and not on any
representation or warranty of Seller or any of its Affiliates not expressly
set forth in this Agreement, in any Ancillary Agreement or in any certificate
delivered by Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement. In light of
these inspections and investigations and the representations and warranties
made to Buyer by Seller and the Company herein, solely with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer is

 



81  relinquishing any right to any claim based on any representations and
warranties other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered by Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall limit the liability of
Seller for fraud or willful misconduct.

 

SECTION 11.02. _Financial Information and Projections._ In connection with
Buyers investigation of the Business, Buyer has received from Seller various
forward-looking statements regarding the Company and the Business (including
the estimates, assumptions, projections, forecasts and plans furnished to it)
(the " _Forward-Looking Statements_ "). Buyer acknowledges and agrees (i)
there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make the Forward-Looking
Statements; (ii) Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties; (iii) Buyer is not
relying on any Forward-Looking Statement in any manner whatsoever; and (iv)
with respect to any Forward-Looking Statements, Buyer shall have no claim
against Seller or any of its Affiliates solely with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement except in the case of fraud or
willful misconduct.

SECTION 11.03. _No Other Representations or Warranties._ Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that except for the representations and warranties contained in
Article III, the Ancillary Agreements or any certificate delivered by Seller
or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) pursuant to this Agreement,
none of Seller or the Company nor any other Person makes or shall be deemed
to make any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the
Business or the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Buyer acknowledges that Seller makes no representation or warranty (a) with
respect to any Forward-Looking Statements made (i) in the Management
Presentation, (ii) in the Data Room, (iii) in any supplemental due diligence
information provided or made available to Buyer, (iv) in connection with
Buyers discussions with management of the Business, (v) in negotiations
leading to this Agreement or (vi) in any other circumstance; (b) with respect
to the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying any Forward-Looking
Statements; or (c) as to merchantability, suitability or fitness for a
particular purpose or quality, with respect to any tangible assets or as to
the condition or workmanship thereof or the absence of any defects
therein, whether latent or patent. Buyer agrees that the representations and
warranties contained in Article III by Seller and the Company, the Ancillary
Agreements or any certificate delivered by Seller or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company) pursuant to this Agreement, are in lieu of, and Buyer
hereby expressly waives all rights to, any implied warranties that may
otherwise be applicable because of the provisions of the Uniform Commercial
Code or any other Law, including the warranties of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose.

SECTION 11.04. _Disclosure Schedules._ Buyer acknowledges and agrees that no
reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Disclosure
Schedules shall be construed as an admission or indication that such item or
other matter is material (nor shall it establish a standard of materiality for
any purpose whatsoever) or that such item or other matter is required to be
referred to or disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules. The information set
forth in the Disclosure Schedules is disclosed solely for the purposes of this
Agreement, and no information set forth therein shall be deemed to be an
admission by any party hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever,
including any violation of Law or breach of any Contract. The Disclosure
Schedules and the information and disclosures contained therein are intended
only to qualify and limit the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of Seller and the

 



82  Company contained in this Agreement. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedules is
intended to broaden the scope of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement or create any covenant. Matters reflected in the Disclosure
Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by the Agreement to
be reflected in the Disclosure Schedules. Such additional matters are set
forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters
of a similar nature.

SECTION 11.05. _To the knowledge._ "To the knowledge of Seller" or other
references to the knowledge or awareness of Seller or its Affiliates means the
actual knowledge, after reasonable due inquiry, of those individuals set forth
on _Schedule 11.05(a)_ and "to the knowledge of Buyer" or other references
to the knowledge or awareness of Buyer or its Affiliates means the actual
knowledge, after reasonable due inquiry, of those individuals set forth on
_Schedule 11.05(b)_.

 

SECTION 11.06. _Expenses._ Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions, including the fees of counsel and accountants, shall be
borne by the party incurring such expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, except
as otherwise provided herein, Seller shall be responsible for any out-of-
pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Company prior to the Closing in
connection with the Transactions, including any fees and expenses of brokers
(as contemplated by Section 3.21 or otherwise), investment bankers, legal
counsel, accountants and other advisors. Buyer and Seller shall each be
responsible for 50% of the antitrust filing fees pursuant to Section 6.03(b).

 

SECTION 11.07. _Modifications and Amendments._ This Agreement shall not be
modified, altered or otherwise amended except pursuant to an instrument in
writing executed and delivered by each of the parties hereto.

SECTION 11.08. _Waivers._ At any time and from time to time prior to the
Closing, the parties hereto may, to the extent permitted under applicable Law,
(a) extend the time for, or waive in whole or in part, the performance of any
obligation of any party hereto under this Agreement; (b) waive any inaccuracy
in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement; or (c) waive
any condition or compliance with any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement. The failure of a party hereto to require performance of
any provision hereof at any time shall in no manner affect such partys right
at a later time to enforce such provision. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement shall not constitute a
waiver of its rights.

 

SECTION 11.09. _Assignability._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by either of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other party; _provided_ that without
such consent, either Seller or Buyer may assign this Agreement or
such partys rights and obligations hereunder to a third party in connection
with a sale or transfer (by means of a merger, stock sale or otherwise) of all
or substantially all of Sellers or Buyers respective business. Any
purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the
preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns.

 



83 SECTION 11.10. _No Third Party Beneficiaries._ Other than as set forth in
Section 10.02 and Section 10.03, nothing in this Agreement, whether express
or implied, shall be construed to give any Person (other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns) any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any
covenants, conditions or provisions contained herein, as a third party
beneficiary or otherwise.

 

SECTION 11.11. _Notices._ Any notice, request, instruction or other
communication to be given hereunder by any party to the other parties shall
be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) when delivered
personally, (b) one business day following the day when sent by overnight
courier (with written confirmation of receipt), (c) three business

shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by Law; (b)
such unenforceability or prohibition in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate

Agreement.

 



85 SECTION 11.18. _Set-Off_. Any payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be

of such state or federal courts in the State of Delaware for the purpose of
