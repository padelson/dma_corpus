dated  as of April 11, 2007, is entered into by and among **Allen  Systems
Group, Inc** **.**   (the " _ _Parent__ "),  a  Delaware corporation,
**ASG  M andA, Inc.**  (the " _ _Purchaser__ "),  a  Delaware corporation
and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent, and **Mobius  Management Systems,
Inc** **.** ,  (the  " _ _Company__ "),  a  Delaware corporation. Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are  defined in Section 10.1 of this
Agreement.

 

 

**RECITALS**

 

 

**WHEREAS** ,  the  respective boards of directors of the Company, the
Parent and the Purchaser  have  deemed it advisable and in the best
interests of their respective corporations  and stockholders to approve the
acquisition of the Company by the Parent upon  the terms and conditions set
forth herein;

 

 

**WHEREAS** ,  the  respective boards of directors of the Parent, the
Purchaser, and the Company  have approved this Agreement and the Merger (as
defined in Section 1.1 hereof)  in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware  (" _ _DGCL__ "),  and  upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 

 

**WHEREAS** ,  the  board of directors of the Company has approved this
Agreement and has determined  that the consideration to be paid for each
share of the issued and outstanding  common stock, $0.0001 par value per
share, of the Company (" _ _Common  Stock__ ")  in the  Merger is fair to
the holders thereof and has resolved to recommend that such  holders adopt 
this Agreement upon  the  terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein; and

 

 

**WHEREAS** ,  the  Parent and the Purchaser have required as a condition
and an inducement to  their  willingness to enter into this Agreement that
concurrently with the execution  and delivery of this Agreement and incurring
the obligations set forth herein,  that certain stockholders of the Company
enter into, and such stockholders  contemporaneously with the execution of
this Agreement have entered into, a  Voting Letter Agreement in substantially
the form attached hereto as Exhibit  A  (" _ _Voting  Agreement__ ") 
pursuant to which such stockholders have agreed, among other things, (i) to 
vote  the shares of Common Stock held by them in favor of the adoption of
this  Agreement and, under certain circumstances, to grant the Parent their
proxy  to  vote such shares, and (ii) not to transfer, sell, hypothecate, or
otherwise  dispose of their beneficial ownership of, or their ability to
vote, the Common  Stock held by them as of the date hereof or which they may
acquire  hereafter.

 

 

**NOW,  THEREFORE** ,  in  consideration of the foregoing, and of the
mutual representations, warranties,  covenants, and agreements herein
contained, the parties hereto hereby agree  as  follows:

 

 

**ARTICLE  1**

 

 

**Terms  of Merger**

shall continue unaffected by  the  Merger. The corporation surviving the
Merger is sometimes hereinafter referred  to as the " _ _Surviving 
Corporation__." The  Merger will be

**1.3** **Effective  Time.** On  the  Closing Date, the Company and the
Purchaser shall jointly prepare and cause  to  be filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware as provided by  the  DGCL an appropriate
Certificate of Merger (the " _ _Certificate  of Merger__ ").  The  Merger
and the other Transactions  shall  become effective on the date and time at
which the Certificate of Merger has  been duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in  accordance with the DGCL (the " _
_Effective  Time__ ").

 

 

**ARTICLE  2**

 

 

**Effects  of the Merger**

 

 

**2.1** **Certificate  of Incorporation.** At  the  Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be  restated and amended to

as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except  that the name
of the Surviving Corporation shall remain "Mobius Management  Systems, Inc."
and the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of the  Purchaser
relating to the incorporator of the Purchaser shall be omitted, and  as  so
restated and amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the 
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided by applicable
Law  and such certificate of incorporation.

 

 

**2.2** **Bylaws.**   The  bylaws of the Purchaser, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time,  shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, except as to the name of  the  Surviving Corporation, which

provided by applicable Law, the certificate of  incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, and such bylaws.

 

 

**2.3** **Directors  an Officers of the Surviving Corporation.** The 
directors of the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from  and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving

Effective Time shall,  from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation,  in each case until their respective successors
shall have been duly elected,  designated or qualified, or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal  in  accordance with the Surviving
Corporation's certificate of incorporation and  bylaws.

 



 

**ARTICLE  3**

 

 

**Manner  of Converting Securities**

 

 

**3.1** **Conversion  of Capital Stock.** Subject  to the provisions of this
Article 3, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the  Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders of the shares of  Common

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Stock  or the  holders of shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per
share, of the Purchaser  (" _ _Purchaser  Common Stock__ "):

 

 

(a) **_Purchaser  Common Stock._**   Each  share of the Purchaser Common
Stock issued  and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall 
be  converted automatically into and become one validly issued, fully paid
and  nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each 
certificate evidencing ownership of the Purchaser Common Stock immediately 
prior  to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, evidence
ownership of  such shares of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(b) **_Parent  Common Stock._**   Each  issued and outstanding share of
common stock, no par value per share, of the  Parent will remain issued and
outstanding.

 

 

(c) **_Conversion  of Common Stock._** Each  outstanding share (including 
any Restricted Shares) of  Common  Stock (other than shares of Common Stock
to be cancelled in accordance with  Section 3.2 and other than Dissenting
Common Stock) shall cease to be  outstanding and shall be converted
automatically into, and represent the right  to receive the Merger
Consideration, payable to the holder thereof in cash,  without interest. From
and after the Effective Time, all such shares of Common  Stock shall no
longer remain outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled  and retired,
and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares  of  Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the  right
to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such 
certificate in accordance with Section 3.6,  without  interest thereon.

 

 

**3.2** **Cancellation  of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.** All 
shares of Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and 
any  shares of Common Stock owned by the Parent, the Purchaser or any other 
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Parent shall be cancelled and retired, and no 
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

**3.3** **Adjustments  to Merger Consideration.**   If,  between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company changes  the number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the  Effective Time as
the result of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend  (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Common  Stock),
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other like change  with
respect to Common Stock (each, an " _ _Adjustment__ "),  the  Merger
Consideration shall  be  adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to
provide the holders of shares  of  Common Stock with the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement  prior to such Adjustment.

 

 

**3.4** **Derivative  Securities.**

 

 

(a) The  Board  of Directors of the Company shall take all actions necessary
to cause, at the  Effective Time, each outstanding option, stock equivalent
right or other right  to acquire shares of Common Stock (an " _ _Option__
" or  " _ _Options__ ")  granted under the Option Plans whether or not then
exercisable or vested, except  as  set forth on Section 3.4(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule,  to be  100% exercisable and vested and to be
cancelled and, in consideration of such  cancellation, at the Effective Time
the Parent shall, or shall cause the  Surviving Corporation to, pay to such
holders of Options, an amount in respect  thereof equal to the product of (x)
the excess, if any, of the Merger  Consideration over the exercise price of
each such Option and (y) the number  of  shares of Common Stock subject to
such Option (such payment, if any, to be  net  of applicable withholding and
excise taxes). As of the Effective Time, all  Option Plans and any agreement
or plan relating to Options shall terminate  and  all rights under any
provision of any other plan, program or arrangement  providing for the
issuance or grant of any other interest in respect to the  capital stock of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 


 

the  RSUs,  shall be cancelled. The Company shall use its commercially 
reasonable  efforts  to effectuate the foregoing, including, but not limited
to, obtaining all  consents necessary to cash out and cancel all Options and
as are necessary  to  ensure that, after the Effective Time, no Person shall
have any right under  any  of the Option Plans, or any other plan, program
or arrangement with respect  to  equity securities of the Surviving
Corporation or any subsidiary thereof. 

 

 

(b) (i)  Immediately  prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock
unit (" _ _RSU__ ")  issued  by the Company under its Option Plans that 
is  outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, whether or not vested and
subject  to conversion into Common Stock under its Option Plans, shall be
converted  automatically into one share of Common Stock and shall be entitled
only to  receive the Merger Consideration,  and  (ii) each restricted share
of Common Stock issued by the Company pursuant to  any  applicable
restricted stock award agreement of the Company and subject to any  vesting,
repurchase or other lapse restrictions thereunder (each, a " _ _Restricted 
Share__ ")  that is  outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, whether
or not vested or subject  to repurchase, shall automatically vest and become
free of such restrictions  and  right of repurchase as of the Effective Time
and shall, as of the Effective  Time, be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive the Merger  Consideration. 

 

 

(c) The  Board  of Directors of the Company shall take all action necessary
to cause (i) any  "Offering Periods" (as defined in the 1998 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, as  amended (the " _ _ESPP__ "))  then  in progress to be
shortened by setting a new "Exercise Date" (as defined in the  ESPP) as of a
date prior to the Effective Time, and any Offering Periods then  in 
progress shall end on such new Exercise Date, and (ii) the termination of
the  ESPP effective as of a time following such new Exercise Date but at or
prior  to  the Effective Time of the Merger, as may be requested by the 
Parent.

 

 

**3.5** **Dissenting  Common Stock.**

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Common Stock
outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time which is held by a
holder who has not voted in  favor  of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has complied with Section  262 of the DGCL (" _ _Dissenting 
Common Stock__ ")  shall  not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, unless  such  holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses its right to appraisal.  A holder of Dissenting Common Stock
shall be entitled to receive payment of  the  appraised value of the Common
Stock held by it in accordance with  Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after
the Effective Time, such holder  fails to perfect or withdraws or loses its
right to appraisal, in which case  such Common Stock shall be converted into
and represent only the right to  receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, upon surrender  of  the Certificate or Certificates
representing such Common Stock pursuant to  Section 3.6.

 

 

(b) The  Company shall give the Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for  appraisal of any Common Stock received by the Company pursuant
to Section 262  of  DGCL, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant  to  the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to rights of appraisal and  (ii) the opportunity to participate in
the conduct of all negotiations and  proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. Except with  the prior written consent of the
Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily  make  any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to  settle any such demands for
appraisal.

 

 

**3.6** **Exchange  of Certificates.**

 

 

(a) **_Paying  Agent._** Prior  to  the Effective Time, the Parent shall
designate a national bank or trust company  (which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company) to act as agent for the  holders of shares of
Common Stock in connection with the Merger  (the " _ _Paying  Agent__ ") 
and to  receive

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 


 

the  funds  to which holders of shares of Common shall become entitled
pursuant to Section  3.1(c). At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent or
the Purchaser shall  deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent,
for exchange, in  accordance with this Section 3.6, and  payment, in
accordance with Section 3.4, an  amount  of cash sufficient to make payment
of the aggregate Merger Consideration (other  than that for Dissenting Common
Stock) and  payments relating to Options and RSUs pursuant  to this
Agreement (such deposited Merger Consideration and payments relating  to 
Options and RSUs pursuant to this Agreement referred to herein as the " _
_Exchange  Fund__ ").  In  the event that a holder of Dissenting Common
Stock effectively withdraws its  dissenters rights under the DGCL following
the Effective Time, such holder  of  Dissenting Common Stock shall properly
surrender its Certificate(s) and  following such surrender : (i) all of such
shares of Dissenting Common Stock  shall be cancelled and (ii) such holder of
the Dissenting Common Stock  surrendered shall receive payment therefor from
the Purchaser or the Parent  in  an amount equal to the Merger Consideration
per share of Dissenting Common  Stock  so cancelled. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such funds shall be invested by  the  Paying Agent as directed 
by the  Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in its sole discretion, pending
payment  thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Common Stock;
_provided_ ,  that  such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States  of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by  Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation,  respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or  banker's acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion  (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank which are then  publicly available). Earnings from such
investments shall be the sole and  exclusive property of the Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, and no part  of  such earnings shall accrue to the
benefit of holders of Common  Stock.

 

 

(b) **_Exchange  Procedures._**   Promptly  after the Effective Time,  but
in  no event more than five (5) Business Days,  the  Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a  certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time  represented
issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (the " _ _Certificates__ ") 
whose  shares were converted pursuant to Section 3.1 into the right to
receive the  Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal in customary
form,  mutually agreed to by the Company and the Parent (which shall specify
that  delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates  shall  pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent) and  (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in  exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. After the
Effective Time,  upon  surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent or to such  other  agent or agents as may be appointed by the
Parent, together with such  transmittal materials, properly and duly
executed, the holder of such  Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger  Consideration for each share of Common Stock
formerly represented by such  Certificate or Certificates, and the
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered  shall forthwith be cancelled, and
the holder of such Certificate shall be paid  promptly in exchange therefor
cash in an amount equal to the Merger  Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the  provisions hereof. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to  a  Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is  registered, it shall be a condition
precedent of payment that (x) the  Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise  in  proper form for transfer and
(y) the Person requesting such payment shall  have paid any transfer and
other taxes required by reason of the payment of  the  Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered holder of the  Certificate surrendered
or shall have established to the satisfaction of the  Surviving Corporation
that such tax either has been paid or is not required  to  be paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.6(b), neither  the Parent nor
the Purchaser shall be obligated to deliver the Merger  Consideration to the
holder of shares of Common Stock and, after the Effective  Time, each
Certificate shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent  only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest  thereon.


 

(c) **_Lost,  Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates._**   If any  Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an  affidavit
(in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser) of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  fact  by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the  Paying Agent will issue, in each case, in exchange for such
affidavit, the  appropriate amount of Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof as  determined in accordance with Section 3.1; provided that
the Person to whom  the  Merger Consideration is paid shall, as a condition
precedent to the payment  thereof, upon the request of the Purchaser, the
Parent, or Surviving  Corporation, indemnify the Surviving Corporation and
the Parent in a manner  reasonably satisfactory to them (by the posting by
such Person of such bond  and  security as the Surviving Corporation and the
Parent my reasonably request)  against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Corporation and the  Parent with respect to the Certificate claimed
to have been lost, stolen or  destroyed.

 

 

(d) **_Transfer  Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock._**  
At the  Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and  thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of  Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time,  the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of shares
of Common Stock  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any  rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock, except
as otherwise provided  for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates  are  presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be cancelled  and exchanged as provided in this
Article 3.

 

 

(e) **_Termination  of Fund; No Liability._**   Subject  to applicable Law,
any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds  of  any
investments thereof) which had been made available to the Paying Agent 
pursuant to Section 3.6 of this Agreement that remain unclaimed by the 
former stockholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time
shall  be paid to the Parent. Any former stockholders of the Company who have
not  theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to
the  Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws)
for  payment of the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Any
other  provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, none of the Parent, the
Purchaser,  the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent shall
be liable  to a  holder of the Common Stock for any amount paid or property
delivered in good  faith to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat, or  similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by any
holder of Common Stock  immediately prior to the time when such amounts would
otherwise escheat to  or  become the property of a federal, state, or local
government authority or court  or administrative or regulatory agency, shall,
to the extent permitted by Law,  become the property of the Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest  of  any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

 

(f) **_Withholding  Taxes._** **** Each  of  the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent, and the Parent shall be entitled  to  deduct and withhold from
the Merger Consideration otherwise payable hereunder  to  any Person such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold pursuant to  any 
applicable Tax Laws. To the extent such amounts are deducted, withheld, and 
paid  to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such deducted and withheld
amounts  shall  be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to such  Person.

 

 

**3.7** **Subsequent  Actions.** If  at any  time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall determine that  any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record  or  otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to  or  under any of
the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or the  Purchaser
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result  of, or
in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, 
then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
authorized  to take all such actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest
all right,  title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or
assets in the  Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement.

(a) Each  of  the Parent and the Purchaser is a corporation incorporated,
validly existing  and  in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction
of its respective  incorporation, and each has all requisite corporate power
and authority to  own  and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as is now being operated  and carried on. Each of the Parent and the
Purchaser is duly qualified or  licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in  each  jurisdiction where the
character of the property owned or leased by it or the  nature of its
business makes such qualification necessary, except where the  failure to be
so qualified or licensed and in good standing would not,  individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Parent  or the
Purchaser, as the case may be.


 

(b) The  Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
Transactions,  has  engaged in no other business activities, and has
conducted its operations as  contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser
is, and immediately prior to  the  Effective Time will be, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Parent, and the  Purchaser has no Subsidiaries.

this Agreement  and the  Voting Agreement.  The  execution, delivery and
performance by the Parent and the Purchaser of this  Agreement and the
Voting  Agreement and the consummation  of the Transactions  and the 
transactions contemplated by the Voting Agreement  have  been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action in respect thereof on  the 
part of each of the Parent and the Purchaser, and by the Parent as the sole 
stockholder of the Purchaser, and no other corporate action is required on 
the  part of the Parent or the Purchaser to authorize the execution and
delivery  by  the Parent and the Purchaser of this Agreement and the
Voting  Agreement and the consummation  by them of the Transactions  and
the  transactions contemplated by the Voting Agreement.  This  Agreement
and  the  Voting Agreement have  been  duly executed and delivered by the
Parent and the Purchaser and, assuming valid  authorization, execution and
delivery hereof and  thereof by  the  Company  (and, in  the case of the
Voting Agreement, by the other parties thereto),  this  Agreement and 
the  Voting Agreement constitute the  valid  and binding obligations  of
each  of the Parent and the Purchaser enforceable against each of them in
accordance  with their  respective  terms  (subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception).

 



 

(b) Neither  the execution and delivery of this Agreement or  the  Voting
Agreement by  the  Parent or the Purchaser, nor the consummation by the
Parent or the Purchaser  of  the Transactions  or the  transactions
contemplated by the Voting Agreement,  or  compliance by the Parent or the
Purchaser with any of the terms or provisions  herein  or  therein, 
will:  (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the certificate of
incorporation  or bylaws of either the Parent or the Purchaser, (ii) violate,
conflict with  or  result in a breach of any terms, conditions or provisions
of, or constitute  a  default (with or without notice or the lapse of time,

a consent pursuant  any  of the terms, provisions, or conditions of any
material loan or credit  agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
trust, license, agreement,  contract, lease, Permit, concession, franchise,
plan or other instrument or  obligation to which the Parent or the Purchaser
is a party or by which any  of  their respective assets or properties is
bound, (iii) require any filing by  the  Parent or the Purchaser with, or
Permit, or Consent of, any Governmental Entity  other than the Regulatory
Filings, or (iv) conflict with or violate any  judgment, order, writ,
Injunction,  decree,  or Law applicable to the Parent, or any of its
properties or assets; except  in  the case of clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) for
such violations, breaches or defaults  which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, impair the ability of each  of  the Parent or the Purchaser
to perform its obligations under this Agreement,  as  the case may be, or
prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of  the  Transactions.

 



 

**5.3** **Information  in the Proxy Statement.**   None of  the information
supplied by the Parent or the Purchaser in writing expressly  for  inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (or any amendment 
thereof or supplement thereto), if necessary, will at the date mailed to 
stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Special Meeting, contain 
any  untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required  to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein,  in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not 
misleading.

**5.5** **Financing. ** The  Purchaser has delivered to the Company a true
and complete copy of the  commitment letter from the Parent's lender to
provide the necessary financing  for the Transactions, and the Parent is not
aware of any reasons why such  financing will not be available at the
Effective Time. Irrespective of any  such  commitment letter or the terms
thereof, at the Effective Time, the Parent and  the Purchaser shall have
sufficient cash, available lines of credit, or other  sources of immediately
available funds to enable the Purchaser to pay the  aggregate Merger
Consideration.

 



 

**5.6** **Litigation. ** There  is  no suit, claim, action, proceeding,
including, without limitation, arbitration  proceeding or alternative dispute
resolution proceeding, or investigation  instituted or pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Parent, threatened against,  affecting or naming as a party
thereto the Parent or the Purchaser, or against  their respective businesses
or assets that, individually or in the aggregate,  are or would materially
impede, delay, or impair the consummation of the  Transactions.

 



 

**5.7** **Not  an Interested Stockholder.**   Neither  the Parent nor the
Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates is an "interested
stockholder" (as such term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) of  the

**6.2** **No  Solicitation.**

 



 

(a) The  Company agrees that it shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all  existing discussions, negotiations  and  communications
with any Persons with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. From  and after
the date of this Agreement and until the earlier of termination of  this
Agreement or the Effective Time, the Company shall not and shall not 
authorize or permit its officers,  directors, employees, investment 
bankers, attorneys, accountants or other agents (collectively, " _
_Representatives__ ") __ to  directly  or indirectly:

 



 

(i) initiate,  solicit or knowingly encourage, or take any action to
facilitate the making  of,  any offer or proposal which constitutes or which
would be reasonably likely  to  lead to any third-party Acquisition
Proposal; or

 



 

(ii) enter  into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal;  or

 



 

(iii) in  the  event of an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, engage in
negotiations or  discussions  with, or  provide any information or data to,
any Person (other than Parent or any of  its  Affiliates or representatives)
relating to an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

The  Company shall promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days,
notify  the Parent if any inquiries or proposals are received by, any
information is  requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated  or  continued with the Company or its Representatives, in
each case, in connection  with an Acquisition Proposal (an " _ _Acquisition 
Proposal Interest__ ").  Such  notice shall identify the Person indicating
such Acquisition Proposal Interest  and the material terms and conditions of
any such Acquisition Proposal. 

 



 

Notwithstanding  the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 6.2(a)
shall prohibit the  Company or its board of directors from taking (and
disclosing to the Company's  stockholders) any position with respect to a
tender or exchange offer by a  third  party in compliance with Rules 14d-9
or 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or making  such other disclosures to the
Company's stockholders if, in the good faith  judgment of the board of
directors of the Company, after consultation with  outside legal counsel,
such disclosure is necessary for the board of directors  of the Company to
comply with its fiduciary duties.

 



 

As  used  in this Agreement, " _ _Acquisition  Proposal__ " __ means 
any  proposal or offer relating to any transaction or series of related
transactions  (other than the Transactions) involving any (A) acquisition or
purchase from  the  Company by any Person or "group" (as defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange  Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, referred to herein  as  a " _ _Group__ ")  of  more  than a
25% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of the Company  or 
any Company Subsidiary, or (B) exchange or tender offer involving the 
Company which, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially
owning  25% or more of any class of outstanding voting securities of the
Company, or  (C)  merger, consolidation, business combination or similar
transaction involving  the  Company, or (D) any sale, lease (other than in
the ordinary course of business),  exchange, transfer,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

license  (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition or
disposition  of  more than 25% of the business or assets of the Company, or
(E) any dissolution  or liquidation of the Company, or (F) any other
transaction similar to the  foregoing with respect to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding  Section 6.2(a) hereof, prior to receipt of the approval
of the stockholders  of  the Company to this Agreement and the Merger, the
Company may furnish, pursuant  to a confidentiality agreement with terms no
less favorable to the Company  than  those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (subject to applicable Law,  including without limitation the
fiduciary obligations of the board of directors  of the Company), information
concerning its business, properties or assets  and  such other information
as it deems relevant to any Person  making  an  Acquisition Proposal that
did not result from a breach of this Agreement and  that the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith (after  consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisors) could be  reasonably expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, and may negotiate and  participate in
discussions and negotiations with such Person concerning such  Acquisition
Proposal if in the good faith opinion of the board of directors  of  the
Company, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company,  it
is  determined that providing such information or access or engaging in
such  discussions or negotiations is in the best interests of the Company and
its  stockholders and necessary in order for the board of directors of the
Company  to  discharge its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders
under applicable  Law. The  Company shall notify the Parent of such
determination relating to a potential  Superior Proposal and shall promptly
provide to the Parent any material  non-public information regarding the
Company provided to any other party, which  was not previously provided to
the Parent.

 

 

As  used  herein, the term " _ _Superior  Proposal__ " shall  mean a bona
fide, written Acquisition Proposal made by such entity or group  on  an
unsolicited basis, and in the absence of any violation of this Section 6.2 
by  the Company, which the board of directors determines, in good faith
after  consultation with its legal and financial advisors, is (i) not subject
to any  condition related to financing or, if so subject, that the board of
directors  of  the Company has determined in its good faith judgment that it
is reasonably  likely to be financed, (ii) reasonably likely to be
consummated (taking into  account the legal aspects of the Acquisition
Proposal, the Person making the  Acquisition Proposal and approvals required
in connection therewith), and (iii)  more favorable (taken as a whole) than
the Merger Consideration to the Company\'s  stockholders from a financial
point of view; _provided_ ,  that a  Superior Proposal may be subject to
customary conditions.

 

 

(c) Except  as  set forth in this Sections 6.2(c), neither the board of
directors of the Company  nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify,
or propose to withdraw  or  modify, in a manner adverse to the Transactions,
to the Parent or to the  Purchaser, the approval or recommendation by the
board of directors of the  Company of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii)
approve or recommend or propose  to  approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) enter into any  agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

Notwithstanding  the foregoing, prior to the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement or  the  Effective Time, the board of directors of the
Company may (subject to the terms  of this and the following sentence)
withhold, withdraw or modify its approval  or  recommendation of this
Agreement and the Merger, approve or recommend a Superior  Proposal, or enter
into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, in  each case at any
time after the third Business Day following the Company's delivery  to the
Parent of a notice of its determination that an Acquisition Proposal 
constitutes a Superior Proposal (a " _ _Superior  Proposal Notice__ "); 
_provided,  however_ ,  that  the Company shall not terminate this
Agreement and enter into an agreement  with  respect to a Superior Proposal
unless __ (i)  prior  to any such termination the Company has provided the
Parent with a Superior  Proposal Notice with respect to such Superior
Proposal as aforesaid, (ii) within  a period of three Business Days following
the delivery of the Superior Proposal  Notice, the Parent does not propose to
amend this Agreement or enter into  an

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative  transaction, in either case which the board of directors of the
Company  determines in its good faith judgment in consultation with its legal
and  financial advisors to be as favorable to the Company's stockholders,
from a  financial point of view, as such Superior Proposal, and (iii) at
least three  full Business Days after the Company has provided the Superior
Proposal Notice,  the Company delivers to the Parent a written notice of
termination of this  Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.2(c) and payment of
the Termination Fee  in  accordance with Section 9.2 of this Agreement.

 



 

**6.3** **SEC  Reports.**   The  Company shall file in a timely manner all
reports, forms, filings, registration  statements, and other documents
(including, but not limited to, all exhibits,  post-effective amendments and
supplements thereto) required to be filed by  it  under the Exchange Act
**(** including,  but not limited to, any applicable reports on Form 8-K)
between the date of  this  Agreement and the Effective Date. If financial
statements are contained in  any  reports filed with the SEC, such financial
statements will present fairly,  in  all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the entity filing  such statements as of the dates
indicated and the consolidated results of  operations, changes in
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the periods  then-ended in
accordance with GAAP (subject in the case of interim financial  statements to
normal recurring year-end adjustments and except for the  permissible absence
of footnote disclosure in unaudited financial statements).  As of their
respective dates, such reports filed with the SEC will comply as  to  form
in all material respects with the Securities Act and the Exchange Act  and 
will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a 
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the  statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made,  not misleading.

(a) For  a  period of six years after the Effective Time, the Parent shall,
or shall cause  the Surviving Corporation (or any successor to the Surviving
Corporation) to  indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former
directors and  officers of the Company and of any Company Subsidiaries, and
Persons who become  any of the foregoing prior to the Effective Time (each an
" _ _Indemnified  Party__ ")  against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, fees and expenses  (including reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel) and judgments, fines,  losses, claims, liabilities
and amounts paid in settlement incurred in  connection with or arising out of
any claim, action, suit, proceeding, or  investigation, whether criminal,
civil, administrative or investigative, arising  out of any acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time  (including, without limitation,
the Transactions); _provided,  however,_   that  neither the Parent  nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be required to indemnify any Indemnified 
Party pursuant hereto if it shall be determined by a court of competent 
jurisdiction that the Indemnified Party acted in bad faith or, with respect 
to  any criminal action or proceeding, that the Indemnified Party did not
have  reasonable cause to believe that its conduct was lawful, whether
asserted or  claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent  permitted under applicable Law. The Parent also shall advance
expenses incurred  promptly upon (but in any event with ten days following)
receipt of statements  therefor from any Indemnified Party; provided that the
Person to whom such  advances are made provides an

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undertaking  to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court
of competent  jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification. The Parent  and  the Company agree that in the event any
claim, action, suit, proceeding, or  investigation is asserted, commenced, or
made within the six-year period  contemplated by this Section 7.7, all rights
to indemnification in respect  of  any such claim, action, suit, proceeding,
or investigation shall continue until  disposition of any and all such
claims.

 



 

(b) The  Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses  existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability
of, the  present or former directors or officers of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary  as provided in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation
or Bylaws, the  Certificate or Articles **** of  Incorporation, as the case
may be, bylaws or similar documents of any of the  Company's Subsidiaries, or
any agreements as in effect as of the date hereof  with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time shall survive  the  Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect. The Parent agrees to cause  the Surviving
Corporation to comply fully with its obligations hereunder and  thereunder.

 



 

(c)(i) The  Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Company's
existing  officers' and directors' liability insurance (" _ _D andO 
Insurance__")  for a  period of not less than six years after the Effective
Time; _provided,  however_ ,  that  the  Parent  may substitute therefor
policies of substantially equivalent coverage and  amounts containing terms
no less favorable to such former directors or officers;  provided, further,
that if the existing DandO Insurance expires or is  terminated or cancelled
during such period, then the  Parent  or  the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain substantially similar DandO  Insurance  on terms  at least as
favorable to such former directors or officers.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 7.7(c)(i) above, the Company
may at its option,  in lieu of complying with the provisions of Section
7.7(c)(i), purchase an  extended reporting period endorsement (the " _
_Policy  Extension__ ")  under  the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage for  the Company's directors and
officers which shall provide such directors and  officers with coverage for
six years following the Effective Time, which policy  shall provide coverage
amounts, terms, and conditions which are no less  favorable to the insured
Persons than the directors' and officers' liability  insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company with respect to acts  or  omissions
occurring prior to or at the Effective Time. The Parent shall take  any  and
all actions necessary or advisable to maintain such Policy Extension, and 
shall so maintain such Policy Extension, on the terms so purchased and shall 
not  modify or amend the terms thereof in any manner.

 



 

(d) In  the  event the Parent, the Surviving Company, or any of their
successors or assigns  (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the  continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger,  or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and  assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary,  proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Parent  assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 7.7.

 



 

(e) The  Parent shall unconditionally guarantee the timely payment of all
funds owing  by,  and the timely performance of all other obligations of,
the Surviving  Corporation under this Section 7.7. From and after the
Effective Time, the  Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, pay  all  expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees that may be
incurred by the  Indemnified Parties in enforcing their indemnity rights and
other rights  provided in this Section 7.7.

 



 

**7.8** **Third  Party Standstill Agreements**.  During  the period from
the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the  Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce and shall  not  terminate,
amend, modify or waive (except in accordance with the terms of the 
applicable agreement) any standstill provision of any confidentiality or 
standstill agreement between the Company

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  its Representatives and other parties entered into  prior to the date
hereof, subject to applicable Law, including without  limitation the
fiduciary obligations of the board of directors of the  Company. 

 

**7.9** **State  Takeover Laws.**   If any  state takeover statute or
similar Laws becomes or is deemed to become applicable  to the Company or the
Merger, then the Company's board of directors shall,  subject to its
fiduciary duties as advised of the same by its counsel, take  all 
reasonable action necessary to render such statute inapplicable to the 
foregoing.

 



 

**7.10** **Stockholder  Solicitation and Approvals.**

 



 

(a) As  soon  as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, and 
subject to the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation,
Section  6.2 hereof, the  Company shall:

 



 

(i)  duly  call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its

practicable for the purpose of considering and taking action upon  the

(ii)  prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy or information

respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC  with  respect to the

information statement (together with  any supplements thereto, the " _
_Proxy  Statement__ ")  to be  mailed to its stockholders;

board of directors  that stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the

Common Stock proxies  in favor of the Merger and take all actions reasonably
necessary or, in the  reasonable opinion of the Purchaser, advisable to
secure the approval of  stockholders required by the DGCL, the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation,  and any other applicable law to effect the
Merger.

 



 

(b) The  Parent agrees promptly to provide the Company with all information
regarding  the  Parent and the Purchaser required to be included in the

**7.11** **Employee  Benefits.**

 



 

(a) For  a  period of six months following the Effective Date of this
Agreement, the  Parent  shall provide  a  notice of termination to any

(ii) two months  for U.S. employees who have less than 5 years service, (iii)
three months for  U.S. employees who have more than 5 but less than 10 years

(b) The  Parent  agrees to cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be,  to  honor  all contracts and agreements of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries,  in accordance with their terms, which
are applicable with respect to any  employee, officer, director or executive
or former employee, officer, director,  or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

executive  of the Company or of any Company Subsidiary,  including without
limitation as contemplated by Section 7.11(f)  hereof.  Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 7.11 or any other provision  of  this Agreement,
the ability or right of the Company, the Surviving Company  or  any Company
Subsidiary to terminate the employment of any of their respective  employees
after the Closing Date shall not be limited or restricted in any  way

agreement, arrangement, policy, plan or commitment). Notwithstanding
anything  in  this Agreement to the contrary, the Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation  to pay all amounts earned by employees of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary  under any contract, agreement, arrangement,
policy, plan or commitment to all  employees who are employed by the Company

immediately prior to the  Effective Time (" _ _Continuing  Employees__ "),

welfare  benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those
provided  to  similarly situated employees of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries under the Parent  Employee Plans (as defined below). Following
the Effective Time, the Parent  will  give each Continuing Employee full
credit for prior service with the Company  or  any Company Subsidiary as if
such service was service with the Parent for  purposes of (w) eligibility and
vesting under any Parent Employee Plans, (x)  determination of benefit levels
under any Parent Employee Plan or policy  relating solely to vacation or
severance and (y) determination of "retiree" status under any Parent Employee
Plan, in each case for which the Continuing  Employee is otherwise eligible
and in which the Continuing Employee is offered  participation, but except
where such credit would result in a duplication of  benefits. In addition,
the Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any  limitations on benefits
relating to pre-existing conditions to the same extent  such limitations are
waived under any comparable plan of the Parent and  recognize for purposes of
annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under  its  medical and dental
plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by  Continuing Employees in
the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.  For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _ _Parent  Employee Plan__ " means  any "employee
pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) that  is a
defined contribution plan, any "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined 
in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other  written plan generally made
available to similarly situated employees of Parent  in the ordinary course
of business by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries  or  any entity which
is a member of (A) a controlled group of corporations (as  defined in Section
414(b) of the Code), (B) a group of trades or businesses  under common
control (as defined in Section 414(c) of the Code) or (C) an  affiliated
service group (as defined in Section 414(m) of the Code or the  regulations
under Section 414(o) of the Code), any of which includes or included  the
Parent or a Subsidiary of the Parent; provided, however, that for  the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoidance  of doubt, the term " _ _Parent  Employee Plan__ " shall  not
include any defined benefit pension plan or any plan providing for  post-
retirement medical or other welfare benefits.

 



 

(f) Simultaneously  with the Closing, and subject thereto, the Company (or
the Surviving  Corporation, as applicable) shall make lump sum cash payments
to the employees  of the Company identified by the Company in an aggregate
amount not to exceed  $800,000.
