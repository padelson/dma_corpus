appropriately adjusted for any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend
thereon).

 



 

Section 2.8 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) _Closing Statement_. As soon as practicable, but not later than sixty (60)
days, after the Closing Date, Parent and its representatives shall prepare and
deliver to the Shareholders Agent a schedule setting forth the Closing Excess
Cash Amount (the " _Closing Statement_ ").

 



 

(b) _Access to Books and Records_. Upon receipt of the Closing Statement, the
Shareholders Agent and its representatives shall be given reasonable access
to the Companys books and records reasonably relating to the Closing
Statement during reasonable business hours for the purpose of verifying the
Closing Statement.

 



 

(c) _Protest Notice_. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing
Statement, the Shareholders Agent may deliver written notice (the " _Closing
Statement Protest Notice_ ") to Parent of any objections that the
Shareholders Agent may have to the Closing Statement. The Closing Statement
Protest Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis of such
objection together with the amount(s) in dispute. If the Shareholders Agent
does not deliver the Closing Statement Protest Notice within the prescribed
time period, the Shareholders Agent shall be deemed to have accepted the
Closing Statement as delivered by Parent.

 



 

(d) _Resolution of Protest_. If Parent and the Shareholders Agent are unable
to resolve any disagreement with respect to the Closing Statement within
thirty (30) days following Parents receipt of the Closing Statement Protest
Notice, then the items in dispute will be

 



      
 

 



 

referred to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or if such firm is unable to perform
such services, then another nationally recognized independent accounting firm
mutually selected by Parent and the Shareholders Agent (such firm referred to
as the " _Accountants_ ") for final determination within thirty (30) days
after submitting the matter to the Accountants, which final determination
shall be final and binding on both Parent and the Shareholders Agent and
shall be within the range of values proposed by Parent and the Shareholders
Agent. The Accountants shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely
on presentations by Parent and the Shareholders Agent, and not by independent
review, only those amounts still in dispute. Parent and the Shareholders
Agent agree to execute, if requested by the Accountants, a reasonable
engagement letter and any other reasonable documentation required by the
Accountants. The fees and expenses of the Accountants shall be allocated
equally between Parent, on the one hand, and the Effective Time Holders (to be
paid first from the Closing Excess Cash Holdback Amount, to the extent it
would be available following any payment to Parent of any adjustment amount as
provided in _Section 2.8(e)_, and second from the Shareholders Agent Reserve
Amount), on the other hand. The term " _Final Closing Statement_ " means the
definitive Closing Statement accepted by the Shareholders Agent in accordance
with _Section 2.8(c)_, agreed to by the Shareholders Agent and Parent or the
definitive Closing Statement resulting from the determinations made by the
Accountants in accordance with this _Section 2.8(d)_ (in addition to those
items theretofore accepted by the Shareholders Agent or agreed to by the
Shareholders Agent and Parent).

 



 

(e) _Final Adjustment and Payment_. If the Closing Excess Cash Amount set
forth on the Final Closing Statement is less than the Closing Excess Cash
Amount set forth on the Consideration Spreadsheet (as may be adjusted pursuant
to the proviso to _Section 2.12(j)(i)_), (i) Parent shall (A) retain a
portion of the Closing Excess Cash Holdback Amount equal to such difference
and (B) within five (5) Business Days following the determination of the Final
Closing Statement, deliver the remainder of the Closing Excess Cash Holdback
Amount, if any, to the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to be paid to the Effective Time Holders in accordance with
_Sections 2.9(a)_ , _2.10(a)_ , _2.10(b)_ , _2.12_ and _2.18_ , as applicable,
and (ii) to the extent such difference exceeds the Closing Excess Cash
Holdback Amount, Parent shall be entitled to offset such excess against the
next Milestone Payment or the PRV Payment, whichever is first. If the Closing
Excess Cash Amount set forth on the Final Closing Statement is greater than
the Closing Excess Cash Amount set forth on the Consideration Spreadsheet (as
may be adjusted pursuant to the proviso to _Section 2.12(j)(i)_), within five
(5) Business Days following the determination of the Final Closing Statement,
Parent shall deliver an amount equal to such excess plus the Closing Excess
Cash Holdback Amount (less any portion thereof applied to the fees and
expenses of the Accountants) to the Exchange Agent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, to be paid to the Effective Time Holders in
accordance with _Sections 2.9(a)_ , _2.10(a)_ , _2.10(b)_ , _2.12_ and _2.18_
, as applicable.

any distribution of the Shareholders Agent Reserve Amount, an amount equal to
the product of (A) the Per Share Shareholders Agent Reserve Amount,
multiplied by (B) the quotient of the aggregate amount of such distribution,
divided by the Shareholders Agent Reserve Amount;

 



 

(ii) each share of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be an existing and issued share of

an amount equal to the Per Share Closing Excess Cash Holdback Amount, and (vi)
in connection with any distribution of the Shareholders Agent Reserve Amount,
an amount equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Shareholders Agent
Reserve Amount, multiplied by (B) the quotient of the aggregate amount of such
distribution, divided by the Shareholders Agent Reserve Amount; and

 



 

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be an existing and issued share of
Company Common Stock, and (except for Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive, without interest, an amount in cash and shares of

with respect to such PRV Payment, (iv) in connection with the payment, if any,

pursuant to _Section 2.8(e)_, an amount equal to the Per Share Closing Excess
Cash Holdback Amount, and (v) in connection with any distribution of the
Shareholders Agent Reserve Amount, an amount equal to the product of (A) the

Agent Reserve Amount.

 



 

(b) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any of the parties hereto or any
holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and shall automatically be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any
such shares of common stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) _Appraisal and Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has made a
demand for appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (any such shares being referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such
time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares),
will not be converted into or represent the right to receive consideration in
accordance with this _Section 2.9_ or otherwise hereunder, but will be
converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to
be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL (and at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set
forth in Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ , _however_ , that if a holder
of Dissenting Shares (a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") withdraws, has failed to
perfect or otherwise loses such holders demand for such payment and appraisal
or becomes ineligible for such payment and appraisal then, as of the later of
the Effective Time or the date on which such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws
such demand or otherwise becomes ineligible for such payment and appraisal,
such holders Dissenting Shares will cease to be Dissenting Shares (and the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting
Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease) and will be converted into
the right to receive the consideration determined in accordance with and
subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.9_ upon surrender of such shares
in accordance with _Section 2.12_. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any written demand received by the Company prior to the Effective
Time for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and any
withdrawal of any such demand and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or
instrument to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect
to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 



 

(d) _Cancellation of Certain Company Capital Stock_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital
Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 2.10 _Company Options, Company RSUs, and Company Warrants_.

 



 

(a) _Company Plan Options and Company RSUs_. At, and contingent upon the
occurrence of, the Effective Time, each Company Plan Option and Company RSU
that is unexpired and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not vested, shall be automatically terminated and converted into
the right to receive, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company Plan Option or Company RSU, in cash and shares of
Parent Common Stock (as provided herein), (i) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, minus, solely in the case of a Company Plan Option, the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Plan
Option, (ii) in the event that any Milestone Payment becomes due pursuant to
_Section 2.11(a)_, the Per Share Milestone Consideration with respect to such
Milestone Payment, (iii) in the event that the PRV Payment becomes due
pursuant to _Section 2.11(b)_, the Per Share PRV Consideration with respect
to such PRV Payment, (iv) in connection with the payment, if any, to the
Effective Time Holders of all or a portion of the Closing Excess Cash Holdback
Amount and any other amount due to the Effective Time Holders pursuant to
_Section 2.8(e)_, an amount equal to the Per Share Closing Excess Cash
Holdback Amount, and (v) in connection with any distribution of the
Shareholders Agent Reserve Amount, an amount equal to the product of (A) the
Per Share Shareholders Agent Reserve Amount, multiplied by (B) the quotient
of the aggregate amount of such distribution, divided by the Shareholders
Agent Reserve Amount. Such amounts shall be paid in accordance with _Section
2.12_ and _2.18_.

 



 

(b) _Company Investor Options and Company Warrants_. At, and contingent upon
the occurrence of, the Effective Time, in accordance with cancellation
agreements being delivered to the Company on the date hereof by each holder of
a Company Investor Option or Company Warrant, each Company Investor Option and
Company Warrant that is unexpired and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be automatically terminated and
converted into the right to receive, with respect to each share of Company
Common Stock underlying such Company Investor Option or Company Warrant, in
cash and shares of Parent Common Stock (as provided herein), (i) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, minus the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock underlying such Company Investor Option or Company Warrant, (ii) in the
event that any Milestone Payment becomes due pursuant to _Section 2.11(a)_,
the Per Share Milestone Consideration with respect to such Milestone Payment,
(iii) in the event that the PRV Payment becomes due pursuant to _Section
2.11(b)_, the Per Share PRV Consideration with respect to such PRV Payment,
(iv) in connection with the payment, if any, to the Effective Time Holders of
all or a portion of the Closing Excess Cash Holdback Amount and any other
amount due to the Effective Time Holders pursuant to _Section 2.8(e)_, an
amount equal to the Per Share Closing Excess Cash Holdback Amount, and (v) in
connection with any distribution of the Shareholders Agent Reserve Amount, an
amount equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Shareholders Agent Reserve
Amount, multiplied by (B) the quotient of the aggregate amount of such
distribution, divided by the Shareholders Agent Reserve Amount. Such amounts
shall be paid in accordance with _Section 2.12_.

 



 

(c) _General_. Neither the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall assume any
Company Option, Company RSU or Company Warrant that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable. The Company
shall take such further steps as may be reasonably necessary to cause the
Company Options, Company RSUs and Company Warrants to be treated as set forth
in this _Section 2.10_, including providing any necessary notices (in each
case, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent). For the avoidance of
doubt, to the extent any holder of Company Options or

 



      
 

 



 

Company Warrants exercises such Company Options or Company Warrants prior to
the Effective Time, such holder shall be a Company Shareholder with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock issued in respect of such exercise (which
shares shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to
Effective Time for all purposes of this Agreement, unless sold or otherwise
transferred prior to the Effective Time).

 



 

Section 2.11 _Contingent Consideration_.

 



 

(a) _Milestone Payments_. Parent shall pay to the Effective Time Holders, in
accordance with this _Section 2.11_, the following payments (each, a "
_Milestone Payment_ ") upon achievement of the following milestones (each, a "
_Milestone_ "):

 



 

(i) an amount equal to $[***] upon [***];

 



 

(ii) an amount equal to $[***] upon [***];

 



 

(iii) an amount equal to $[***] upon [***];

 



 

(iv) an amount equal to $[***] upon [***];

 



 

(v) an amount equal to $[***] upon [***];

 



 

(vi) an amount equal to $[***] upon [***]; and

 



 

(vii) an amount equal to $[***] upon [***].

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, each Milestone may only be achieved one time and
each Milestone Payment may only be paid one time, if at all.

 



 

(b) _PRV Payment_. Promptly following the approval by the FDA of a New Drug
Application for Zorblisa in the treatment of Epidermolysis Bullosa, Parent
shall request the related Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher under
the FDCA (the " _PRV_ "). If Parent obtains the PRV and sells or otherwise
transfers to a third party the PRV, Parent shall pay to the Effective Time
Holders, in accordance with this _Section 2.11_, an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) $100,000,000 and (ii) 50% of the total proceeds from the PRV
sale or transfer, with a reduction in such total proceeds only for reasonable
out-of-pocket transaction-related costs and expenses

 



      
 

 



 

(excluding any Taxes) incurred by Parent in connection with the PRV sale (the
" _PRV Payment_ "). If Parent elects to sell or to otherwise transfer to a
third party the PRV prior to the achievement of the Milestone set forth in
_Section 2.11(a)(ii)_, such sale or transfer shall be subject to the prior
written consent of the Shareholders Agent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If Parent obtains the PRV and
has not entered into an agreement to sell or otherwise transfer to a third
party the PRV within one (1) year of its receipt, the Shareholders Agent may
appoint a financial advisor reasonably acceptable to Parent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the reasonable fees and
expenses of such financial advisor to be paid by Parent (and which fees and
expenses shall not be deducted from the proceeds of the PRV sale set forth
above), to conduct a process to sell the PRV; _provided_ that any such sale is
be subject to the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If Parent determines in its
sole discretion to use the PRV, Parent shall give the Shareholders Agent
written notice thereof and shall pay to the Effective Time Holders, in
accordance with this _Section 2.11_, $100,000,000. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parents (or the designated financial advisors as set forth above)
inability to sell the PRV after complying with the provisions of this _Section
2.11(b)_, including as a result of any Legal Requirements, shall not give rise
to any payment set forth above.

 



 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Any Milestone Payment or the PRV Payment shall be
payable at Parents sole election in cash, in shares of Parent Common Stock
based on the Parent Stock Value, or a combination of both; _provided_ that (i)
the PRV Payment shall be made in cash if the PRV Payment is due as a result of
sale of the PRV for cash (or, if the proceeds of a PRV sale consist of cash
and other consideration, the PRV Payment shall include a cash portion of no
less than the percentage of cash included in such proceeds) and (ii) in the
event that the Parent Common Stock is no longer listed on NASDAQ or another
national exchange (whether as a result of a merger of Parent into another
Person, the acquisition of Parent, Parent effecting a going-private
transaction or otherwise), Parent (or its successor) shall pay such Milestone
Payment or the PRV Payment in cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence,
any Effective Time Holder that is unable to deliver an accredited investor
certificate with its Letter of Transmittal certifying such Effective Time
Holders status as an "accredited investor" (as such term is defined in Rule
501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act) may receive, at
Parents election, its portion of any Milestone Payment or the PRV Payment, as
applicable, otherwise payable hereunder in shares of Parent Common Stock in
cash. In the event that a Milestone Payment or the PRV Payment is due pursuant
to _Section 2.11(a)_ or _Section 2.11(b)_, then Parent shall (x) in the case
_Section 2.11(a)(i)_  _(iv)_ or _Section 2.11(b)_, as soon as practicable
and in no event more than thirty (30) days following such Milestone Payment or
PRV Payment becoming due, or (y) in the case of _Section 2.11(a)(v)_ 
_(vii)_ , as soon as practicable and in no event more than thirty (30) days,
in the case of cash, and ten (10) Business Days, in the case of shares of
Parent Common Stock, following such Milestone Payment or PRV Payment becoming
due, deliver or cause to be delivered to the Exchange Agent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, such amount of shares of Parent Common Stock
(which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form) and/or an amount of cash
in U.S. dollars sufficient to be issued and paid in connection with such
Milestone Payment or PRV Payment, to be paid to the Effective Time Holders in
accordance with _Sections 2.9(a)_ , _2.10(a)_ , _2.10(b)_ , _2.12_ and _2.18_
, as applicable.

 



 

(d) _Diligence_. Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) and licensees, as applicable, to, (i) act in good faith
and use

 



      
 

 



 

Commercially Reasonable Efforts to achieve the Milestones, including using
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (A) conduct the Companys Phase 3 Trial,
(B) if such trial is successful, file applications for marketing approval for
Zorblisa in the indication of Epidermolysis Bullosa in U.S., the European
Union and Japan and (C) upon obtaining marketing approval, commercialize
Zorblisa, where " _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_ " means such commercially
reasonable efforts as are typically used by a similarly-situated
pharmaceutical company with respect to the development and commercialization
of prescription pharmaceutical products of similar commercial potential at a
similar stage in product lifecycle, taking into consideration the safety and
efficacy of such product, its competitiveness compared to alternative third
party products, the proprietary position of the product (including scope and
duration of relevant patents), the scope, timing and likelihood of regulatory
approval, the regulatory status of the product, whether the product is subject
to a clinical hold, recall or market withdrawal, and the anticipated
reimbursability and pricing of the product, and (ii) refrain from taking any
action in bad faith or without reasonable basis which is intended to prevent,
or the primary effect of which is to prevent, the realization of the
achievement of any of the Milestones.

 



 

(e) _Reporting; Records_.

 



 

(i) From and after the Effective Time and until the earlier of [***] (the "
_Reporting Period_ "), Parent shall provide the Shareholders Agent, within
sixty (60) days following January 1 and July 1 of each calendar year, with
reasonably detailed semiannual reports of the (a) status of efforts to achieve
the Milestones ( _provided_ that the reports, schedules, forms, statements and
other documents filed or furnished by Parent with or to the SEC shall be
deemed to satisfy this reporting obligation (except if Parent has undertaken a
Disposal Transaction); _provided_ , _further_ , that if (i) Parent is no
longer required to file such reports under the Exchange Act or (ii) has
undertaken a Disposal Transaction, then reports regarding Zorblisa that are
reasonably consistent in scope and timing with the reports regarding Zorblisa
filed or furnished by Parent with or to the SEC prior to such time shall be
deemed to satisfy this reporting obligation) and (b) as applicable, Net Sales
in the immediately preceding two calendar quarters. The Shareholders Agent
may disclose each such report (including its analysis thereof) to its
Representatives, to the Advisory Group and to each Effective Time Holder that
is a venture capital fund or other institutional or strategic investor (and
each such Effective Time Holder shall be permitted to disclose any such report
(including any analysis thereof) to its Representatives) so long as each such
Person receiving any such report (or analysis thereof) is subject to
reasonable confidentiality obligations with (x) Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and (y) the Shareholders Agent with respect thereto. Within
thirty (30) days after receipt of such a report, if the Shareholders Agent
has inquiries regarding the status of activities described in such report, the
Shareholders Agent may request a meeting with representatives of Parent to
discuss such report, and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
make available for such a meeting (which may be

 



      
 

 



 

held via teleconference) the relevant employees or representatives responsible
for the activities set forth in the report.

 



 

(ii) With respect to the achievement of any of the Milestones or the events
giving rise to a PRV Payment, Parent shall provide written notice to the
Shareholders Agent of such occurrence no later than (A) ten (10) Business
Days after the occurrence thereof, in the case _Section 2.11(a)(i)_  _(iv)_
or _Section 2.11(b)_ or thirty (30) days in the case of _Section 2.11(a)(v)_
 _(vii)_.

 



 

(iii) During the Reporting Period, to the extent consistent with the manner in
which it maintains its other comparable books and records, Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) and licensees
to, keep accurate books and records relating to efforts to achieve the
Milestones and as necessary to verify Net Sales, and Parent shall obtain from
such licensees reasonable copies of such books and records. Such records shall
be maintained for a period of two (2) years following the end of the calendar
year to which they pertain.

 



 

(iv) During the Reporting Period and for a period of one (1) year thereafter,
upon the written request of the Shareholders Agent, Parent shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to, permit
Representatives of the Shareholders Agent, which may be an independent public
accountant (other than the Accountants), at the Shareholders Agents expense
(but with no charge by Parent or its Affiliates), to have access solely in
response to a request made during the Reporting Period, upon reasonable prior
notice and during normal business hours, but no more than one (1) time during
any calendar year, to inspect and make copies of the records specified in
_Section 2.11(e)(iii)_ for the immediately preceding calendar year, for the
purpose of determining the accuracy of the Net Sales for the most recent
calendar year included in the reports described in _Section 2.11(e)(i)(b)_;
_provided_ , that each such Person conducting such inspection shall be subject
to reasonable confidentiality obligations with the Surviving Corporation with
respect thereto.

 



 

(v) If within thirty (30) days following any audit of Net Sales conducted
pursuant to _Section 2.11(e)(iv)_, the Shareholders Agent notifies Parent of
any disagreement with the Net Sales for the immediately preceding calendar
year included in the reports described in _Section 2.11(e)(i)_, the
Shareholders Agent and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve such disagreement within thirty (30) days following such notice. If
Parent and the Shareholders Agent are unable to resolve any such disagreement
within such thirty (30) day period, then the items in dispute will be referred
to the Accountants for arbitration within thirty (30) days after submitting
the matter to the Accountants, which arbitration shall be final and binding on
both Parent and the Effective Time Holders. The Accountants shall act as an
arbitrator to determine, based solely on presentations by Parent and the
Shareholders Agent, and not by independent review, only those amounts still
in dispute. Parent and the Shareholders Agent agree to execute, if requested
by the Accountants, a reasonable engagement letter and any other reasonable
documentation required by the Accountants. The fees and expenses of the
Accountants shall be borne by the Effective Time Holders (to be paid by the
Shareholders Agent, and the Shareholders Agent shall be entitled to recover
such

 



      
 

 



 

fees and expenses from the Shareholders Agent Reserve Amount or, to the
extent the Shareholders Agent Reserve Amount is insufficient, by offset
against the next Milestone Payment or the PRV Payment, whichever is first),
except Parent shall pay the fees and expenses of the Accountants if it is
finally determined the Net Sales were underreported for such immediately
preceding calendar year by more than four percent (4%).

 



 

(f) _Disposal Restrictions_. During the Reporting Period, neither Parent nor
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) shall transfer, sell,
license or assign, to any third Person who is not an Affiliate of Parent, all
or substantially all of the rights covering Zorblisa (excluding a PRV sale as
contemplated by _Section 2.11(b)_), including as a part of a sale that
includes all or substantially all of the assets of Parent or such Affiliate
(including the Surviving Corporation) or all of the equity interests of, or a
merger with, the Surviving Corporation, unless the transferee of such sale
assumes the obligations of Parent under this _Section 2.11_, including
payment of the Milestone Payments and the PRV Payment (except to the extent
previously paid), and Parent remains responsible for the performance of such
obligations (a " _Disposal Transaction_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
merger or consolidation, or acquisition by a third Person of all or any of the
equity securities, of Parent (or of an acquirer of, or successor-in-interest
to, Parent) shall not be a Disposal Transaction.

 



 

Section 2.12 _Surrender of Certificates and Payment; Consideration
Spreadsheet_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC shall act
as paying and exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the Merger. Parent
shall be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(b) _Parent to Provide Parent Common Stock and Cash_. On the Closing Date,
Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent for exchange and payment in
accordance with this _Article II_ shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall
be in non-certificated book-entry form) and an amount of cash in U.S. dollars
sufficient to be issued and paid pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)_, _Section
2.10(b)_ and _Section 2.12(h)_, payable pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_, in each case, in accordance with the provisions of a paying
agent agreement and exchange agent agreement to be executed at the Effective
Time in forms reasonably acceptable to the Shareholders Agent. Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to make such payments of cash and shares of Parent
Common Stock to the applicable Effective Time Holders in accordance with this
_Article II_.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall
cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
representing Company Capital Stock (each, a " _Company Certificate_ ") or
shares of Company Capital Stock that are in non-certificated book-entry form
or Company Investor Option or Company Warrant, in each case whose shares of
Company Capital Stock (or Company Investor Option or Company Warrant) will be
converted into the right to receive consideration pursuant to _Section
2.9(a)_ or _2.10(b)_ , a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_ (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and a lock-up agreement (that
among other things provides for a lock-up period of 30 days for one-third of
the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in connection with the Initial
Amount, the Aggregate Series B Preference and the Aggregate Series A
Preference and 60 days for one-third of the shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in connection with the Initial Amount, the Aggregate Series B
Preference and the Aggregate Series A Preference) in the form attached hereto
as

 



      
 

 



 

 _Exhibit C_ (a " _Lock-Up Agreement_ "). Upon surrender of all shares of
Company Capital Stock (or Company Investor Options or Company Warrants) held
by an Effective Time Holder for cancellation to the Exchange Agent in
accordance with such Effective Time Holders Letter of Transmittal, together
with such Letter of Transmittal and a Lock-Up Agreement, in each case, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the shares of Company Capital Stock (or Company Investor Options or Company
Warrants) so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled and, subject to _Section
2.16_, the holder of such shares of Company Capital Stock (or Company Investor
Options or Company Warrants) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-
certificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive and (ii) a check or
wire transfer in the amount that such holder has the right to receive,
including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section
2.12(h)_, in each case pursuant to this _Article II_. Until so surrendered,
each outstanding share of Company Capital Stock (or Company Investor Option or
Company Warrant) that was outstanding prior to the Effective Time (including
each Company Certificate representing shares of Company Capital Stock) will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to
evidence the right to receive the respective consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 2.9(a)_ or _2.10(b)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any
merger consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or unpaid dividends
and distributions payable to holders of Company Capital Stock (or Company
Investor Options or Company Warrants). Nothing in this _Section 2.12_ or
otherwise herein shall limit the rights of the holders of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock to payments under the Series B Additional Purchase Price
Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any merger consideration is to be distributed
to a Person with a name other than that in which any shares of Company Capital
Stock (or Company Investor Options or Company Warrants) surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered (or has been issued), it will be a condition
of the distribution thereof that the applicable procedures set forth in the
applicable Effective Time Holders Letter of Transmittal have been followed,
including that it shall have been established to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that any transfer or other Tax required by reason of
payment in cash to any Person with a name other than that of such registered
holder has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article
II_, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto
shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to any Governmental
Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal
Requirements.

 



 

(f) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Any merger consideration made available
to the Exchange Agent and not paid to the Effective Time Holders in accordance
with this _Article II_ within six (6) months after the Effective Time shall
be redelivered or repaid by the Exchange Agent to Parent, after which time any
holder of shares of Company Capital Stock (or Company Investor Options or
Company Warrants) who has not theretofore surrendered such shares of Company
Capital Stock (or Company Investor Options or Company Warrants) together with
such Effective Time Holders Letter of Transmittal and Lock-Up Agreement to
the Exchange Agent, subject to applicable Legal Requirements, shall look as a
general creditor only to Parent for payment of the consideration to which such
Effective Time Holder is entitled

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this _Article II_. If any shares of Company Capital Stock (or
Company Investor Options or Company Warrants) are not surrendered prior to the
earlier of the second (2nd) anniversary of the Effective Time and such time as
the unclaimed merger consideration payable therefor would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Entity, such unclaimed merger
consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) _Dividends and Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered shares of Company Capital Stock (or Company
Investor Options or Company Warrants) until surrendered as provided in this
_Section 2.12_. Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat
(in accordance with _Section 2.12(f)_), Tax or other applicable Legal
Requirements, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of
the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time
of such surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of
such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not
previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of
shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

 



 

(h) _No Fractional Shares_.

 



 

(i) After taking into account all shares of Parent Common Stock to which an
Effective Time Holder is entitled at a particular time, no certificates or
scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
pursuant to this _Article II_, no dividends or other distributions of Parent
shall relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
stockholder of Parent.

 



 

(ii) In lieu of such fractional share interests, Parent, the Exchange Agent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall pay to each Effective Time
Holder otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share interest pursuant to
this _Article II_, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the
fractional share interest to which such Effective Time Holder is entitled,
after taking into account all shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
Effective Time Holder is entitled at such time, multiplied by (B) the Parent
Stock Value.

 



 

(i) _Payments on behalf of the Company_. At or as promptly as practicable
after the Closing (or the applicable Milestone Payment or PRV Payment upon the
direction of the Shareholders Agent in accordance with the Consideration
Spreadsheet), but in any event within two (2) Business Days thereafter, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to the applicable recipients
thereof each of their applicable portion of the Company Fees and Expenses (or
such portion, if any, of such Milestone Payment or PRV Payment to be paid to a

 



      
 

 



 

third party at the direction of the Shareholders Agent in accordance with the
Consideration Spreadsheet) in accordance with the instructions contained in
the Consideration Spreadsheet (or, in the case of such Milestone Payment or
PRV Payment, delivered by the Shareholders Agent) (including to Company
employees through the Surviving Corporations payroll system); _provided_ that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have received a payoff letter from
each such recipient of the Company Fees and Expenses (or portion of such
Milestone Payment or PRV Payment) acknowledging and agreeing that, upon
receipt of the payment provided for in this _Section 2.12(i)_, all
obligations to such recipient for all fees and expenses incurred through the
date thereof shall be fully satisfied and discharged; _provided_ that such
payoff letter may acknowledge that the Effective Time Holders are responsible
to pay such recipient additional fees and expenses from any Milestone Payment
or PRV Payment upon the direction of the Shareholders Agent pursuant to this
_Section 2.12(i)_.

 



 

(j) _Consideration Spreadsheet_. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a spreadsheet in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (such form, the " _Illustrative Consideration
Spreadsheet_ ") reflecting (i) the Initial Amount and the Companys good faith
estimate of the Closing Excess Cash Amount (including the Company Fees and
Expenses and the Closing Net Working Capital Amount), which amounts shall be
consented to by Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ if such consent has been withheld and no
agreement between the Company and Parent can be reached after good faith
negotiations by close of business on the Business Day prior to the Closing
Date, the parties shall proceed to Closing on the Closing Date and the
Consideration Spreadsheet as initially delivered shall be used for purposes of
this _Section 2.12(j)(i)_, (ii) the Aggregate Series B Preference Amount, the
Per Share Series B Preference Amount, the Aggregate Series A Preference
Amount, the Per Share Series A Preference Amount, the Closing Company Share
Number, the Per Share Merger Consideration and the Per Share Shareholders
Agent Reserve Fund Amount, (iii) the Aggregate Exercise Amount and the amount
payable in connection with the Closing to each Cashed-Out Holder and holder of
Company Investor Options or Company Warrants, (iv) with respect to each of the
foregoing items (to the extent applicable), the portion thereof payable in
cash and shares of Parent Common Stock (and the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in connection therewith), (v) each Effective Time
Holders Proportionate Share and the amount payable in connection with the
Closing to each Effective Time Holder, (vi) each Effective Time Holders
physical and e-mail address, (vii) wire instructions for any amounts to be
paid on behalf of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to _Section 2.12(i)_,
and (viii) any fees and expenses to be paid from any Milestone Payment or PRV
Payment upon direction of the Shareholders Agent pursuant to _Section
2.12(i)_ (the spreadsheet described in this sentence, the " _Consideration
Spreadsheet_ "). The calculations contained in the Consideration Spreadsheet,
as delivered by the Company to Parent, shall be made without regard to
withholding and shall be used to determine the amounts to be paid at the
Closing pursuant to this _Article II_ (and the Proportionate Shares of the
Effective Time Holders specified therein shall be used to allocate payments to
be made to or by the Effective Time Holders after the Closing). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Consideration Spreadsheet shall not include any
payments to be made under the Series B Additional Purchase Price Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.13 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of any shares
of Company Capital Stock on the records of the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

From and after the Effective Time, the Cashed-Out Holders and the holders of
shares of Company Capital Stock (and Company Investor Options and Company
Warrants) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. If, after the Effective Time,
shares of Company Capital Stock (or Company Options or Company Warrants) are
presented to the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
II_.

 



 

Section 2.14 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall
cause to be paid in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof as provided in the such holders Letter of Transmittal, such payment
of consideration as may be required pursuant to this _Article II_; _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent or the Exchange Agent may, in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates to deliver a bond
in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the
Company Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

Section 2.15 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If at any time
after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company, the officers and directors of Parent,
the Company and the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of
their respective entities or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful
and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.16 _Tax Withholding_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the merger consideration payable hereunder, or other
payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, the amounts required to
be deducted and withheld under the Code, or any provision of any U.S. federal,
state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to reduce or eliminate any such withholding, including by requesting any
appropriate Tax forms such as IRS Form W-9 or the appropriate series of IRS
Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information, from the recipients of
payments deliverable under this Agreement. Any amounts so withheld shall be
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity. To the extent that any
amounts so deducted and withheld are paid over to the appropriate Tax
Authority in accordance with applicable Tax law, such deducted and withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to such holder in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made.

 



 

Section 2.17 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) imposed on any Person with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be borne and paid by such Person.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 2.18 _Cashed-Out Holders_. On the Closing Date and each date that a
Milestone Payment or the PRV Payment is due, Parent shall deliver (a) to the
Surviving Corporation, the amount of cash payable to the Cashed-Out Holders
pursuant to this _Article II_ (including _Section 2.12(h)_) in respect of
such payment, which, within two (2) Business Days thereafter, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to the applicable Cashed-Out Holders
(through its payroll system, in the case of Cashed-Out Holders who received
their Company Plan Options or Company RSUs in their capacities as employees),
and (b) to the Exchange Agent, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested) pursuant to this _Article II_ issuable to the
Cashed-Out Holders in respect of such payment, which Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to issue to the applicable Cashed-Out Holders pursuant to
Parents exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent. It is condition
precedent to each Cash-Out Holders receipt of the shares of Parent Common
Stock to which such Cashed-Out Holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.10(a)(i)_ that such Cashed-Out Holder deliver to Parent a duly-executed
Lock-Up Agreement.

Section 3.14 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) _Section 3.14_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists, with respect to
the Company and any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is
treated as a single employer with the Company (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ")
within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code, (i) all
employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")), (ii) each loan to any
non-officer employee, and loans to officers and directors, in each case that
was made by the Company and is currently outstanding, and any stock option,
stock purchase, phantom stock, stock appreciation right, restricted stock
unit, supplemental retirement, severance, termination, change in control,
sabbatical, medical, dental, vision care, disability, employee relocation,
cafeteria benefit (Code Section 125) or dependent care (Code Section 129),
life insurance or

 



      
 

 



 

accident insurance plans, programs, agreements or arrangements, (iii) all
bonus, profit sharing, savings, deferred compensation, equity compensation or
incentive plans, programs, agreements or arrangements, (iv) other material

any current or former offer letters or employment or executive compensation or

to, any present or former employee, consultant or director of the Company, in
each case, to the extent currently effective or sponsored by the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate, or with respect to which the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate has or may have any current or future liability (whether current or
contingent), and excluding the payment of regular wages or salary in the
ordinary course of business, and (vi) all plans, programs, agreements and
arrangements provided to any current or former director, officer, employee or
consultant of the Company employed in a jurisdiction outside the U.S.
(together, the " _Company Employee Plans_ "); _provided_ that _Section 3.14_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule (but not the definition of "Company
Employee Plans") may exclude offer letters for at-will employment and option
grant documents for options listed in _Section 3.2(d)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) The Company has provided to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of
each of the Company Employee Plans and related material plan documents
(including trust documents, insurance policies or Contracts, employee
booklets, summary plan descriptions and summary of material modifications) and
has, with respect to each Company Employee Plan which is subject to ERISA
reporting requirements, made available copies of the Form 5500 reports filed
for the last three (3) plan years. Any Company Employee Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has either (i) obtained from the
IRS a favorable determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code
or (ii) has established such Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code under a standardized or non-standardized
prototype plan for which an Internal Revenue Service opinion letter has been
obtained by the plan sponsor and is valid as to the adopting employer. The
Company has also furnished or made available to Parent the most recent IRS
determination, notification, advisory, or opinion letter issued with respect
to each such Company Employee Plan, and nothing has occurred since the
issuance of each such letter which would reasonably be expected to cause the
loss of the tax-qualified status of any Company Employee Plan subject to Code
Section 401(a).

 



 

(c) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or
other retiree welfare benefits to any Person, except as required by applicable
Legal Requirements. To the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no non-
exempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section 406 of
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, with respect to any Company Employee Plan.
Each Company Employee Plan has been established and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the
requirements prescribed by any and all applicable statutes, rules and
regulations (including ERISA and the Code). Neither the Company nor any of its
ERISA Affiliates is subject to any liability or penalty under Sections 4976
through 4980 of the Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any of the
Company Employee Plans. All contributions required to be made by the Company
or any of its ERISA Affiliates to any Company Employee Plan have in all
material respects been made on or before their due dates. With respect to each
Company Employee Plan, no "reportable event" within the meaning of Section
4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the 30 day notice
requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA)
nor any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 or

 



      
 

 



 

ERISA has occurred. Each Company Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or
otherwise discontinued after the Closing Date in accordance with its terms,
without material liability to Parent, the Company or any of its ERISA
Affiliates (other than ordinary administrative expenses typically incurred in
a termination event). No suit, administrative proceeding, action or other
litigation has been brought, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is
threatened, against or with respect to any such Company Employee Plan,
including any audit or inquiry by the IRS, the United States Department of
Labor or any other local Tax Authority other than requests for payments in the
ordinary course or requests for qualified domestic relations orders and other
routine claims for benefits.

 



 

(d) Each Company Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Code Section 409A(d)(1)) has in all material respects
been operated since January 1, 2005 in good faith compliance with Code Section
409A and the regulations and guidance in respect thereto and in compliance
with Code Section 409A and the regulations and guidance in respect thereto
after December 31, 2008. No Company Option has an exercise price that has been
or may be less than, the fair market value of the underlying stock as of the
date such option was granted as determined by the Board of Directors of the
Company in accordance with Section 422 of the Code in the case of incentive
stock options or has any feature for the deferral of compensation other than
the deferral of recognition of income until the later of exercise or
disposition of such option, in each case, determined in accordance with the
regulations and guidance under Code Section 409A.

 



 

(e) Neither the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) entitle any
current or former employee, director or other service provider of the Company
or any ERISA Affiliates to severance benefits or any other similar termination
payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, (ii) increase any
benefits otherwise payable by the Company under any Company Employee Plan or
(iii) except as expressly provided in _Section 2.10_, accelerate the time of
payment or vesting of Company Options, Company RSUs, or any other benefit, or
otherwise increase the amount of compensation due any such employee, director
or service provider.

 



 

(f) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company or any ERISA Affiliates relating to,
or change in participation or coverage under, any Company Employee Plan that
would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Company Employee
Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to that Company Employee
Plan for the most recent fiscal year included in the Financial Statements.

 



 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates maintains, sponsors,
participates in or contributes to, nor have such entities ever maintained,
established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to, any pension plan
(within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) which is subject to Section 302
of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

 



 

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates is a party to, or has
made any contribution to or otherwise incurred any obligation to contribute
to, any "multi employer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is obligated to make any
parachute payments as such term is defined in Section 280G of the Code, and
neither is a party to any agreement that is reasonably likely to obligate it,
or any successor in interest, to make any parachute payments that will not be
deductible under Section 280G of the Code. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate is obligated to make reimbursement or gross-up payments to any
Person in respect to excess parachute payments. _Section 3.14(i)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule lists each person who the Company reasonably
believes is, with respect to the Company and/or any ERISA Affiliate, a
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined as of the date hereof.

with respect to the Company, and no such investigation is in progress.

 



 

(d) The Company has not at any time been a party to any collective bargaining

relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by the Company
because of the nature of the business conducted by the Company or to the use
of Trade Secrets or proprietary information of others. The employment of each
of the employees of the Company is "at-will" and, except as required by
applicable Legal Requirements, the Company does not have any obligation to
provide any particular form or period of notice prior to terminating the
employment of any of its employees.

and complete list of (i) the names, titles, work location, overtime
classification and current salaries of all employees, directors and elected
and appointed officers of the Company, and (ii) each employee of the Company
who is on a leave of absence from work (and the basis of such leave). No

information required to be disclosed in Parents reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that
all such information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as

(a) The Company shall afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Closing to (i) all

information concerning the business of the Company and its respective
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request.

(c) From the date hereof until the Closing, the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent, on the other hand, shall give prompt notice to the other upon learning
of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-
occurrence, as the case may be, would reasonably be likely to cause either (A)
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate such that one of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article
VII_ would be unsatisfied at the Closing Date or (B) any condition set forth
in _Article VII_ to be unsatisfied at the Closing Date and (ii) any material
failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.1(c)_ shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice or the representations or warranties of the parties hereto or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto. If a party fails to
notify the other party of a breach of a representation or warranty pursuant to
_Section 6.1(c)(i)(A)_, such other party shall only be entitled to bring a
claim for breach of such representation or warranty and not a claim for breach
of this _Section 6.1(c)(i)(A)_ unless the failure or delay in providing such
notice prejudiced the party entitled to receive such notice.

than thirty (30) days after the end of each fiscal month, the Company shall
provide to Parent an unaudited balance sheet as of the end of such month and

Agreement_ "). The parties hereto agree that the terms and conditions of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and information exchanged in connection with
the execution hereof and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect as of the
Closing.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Public Disclosure_. Prior to the Closing, the Company and its
Representatives shall not issue any press release or make any public statement
or disclosure regarding the terms of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written approval of Parent (which

parties shall cooperate in good faith to issue a mutually acceptable press
release in connection with Parents announcement of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Reasonable Efforts and Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Shareholders Agent agree
to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable (subject to any applicable Legal Requirements) to consummate and
make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable, including: (i) the satisfaction of the other parties

providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its
advisors prior to filing and, if requested, accepting reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith. The Company and Parent
shall furnish to each other all information required for any application or
other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any Legal
Requirement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and the Company agree that
nothing contained in this _Section 6.4(a)_ shall modify or affect their
respective rights and responsibilities under _Section 6.4(b)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, the Company and Parent agree, and shall cause
each of their respective Representatives, to cooperate and to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearances or
approvals required for the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by

Federal Trade Commission Act and any other Legal Requirement designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or be
construed to require Parent to take, or agree to take, any action that would
result in any Burdensome Condition, and the Company shall not take, or agree
to take, any action that would result in any Burdensome Condition without the
prior written consent of Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, a "
_Burdensome Condition_ " means making proposals, executing or carrying out
agreements (including consent decrees) or submitting to Legal Requirements to
divest or hold separate any of Parents or the Companys existing assets or
businesses or to discontinue or limit any operations or the conduct of their
respective businesses or to procure any such divestment, holding separate,
discontinuation or limitation by any of their respective Affiliates, in each
case, except as would not impair in any material respect the expected benefits
of Parent and its Affiliates from or relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Parent shall pay all of the filing fees and other costs and
expenses payable to any Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Laws relating
to the foregoing and to the transactions contemplated hereby, irrespective of
whether the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated. Except to the
extent prohibited by Legal Requirements, (i) the parties hereto will consult
and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, arguments and opinions made
or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with
proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law, (ii) the parties hereto
shall give each other party reasonable prior notice of any communication with,
and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any
Governmental Entity regarding any Antitrust Law, (iii) no party hereto shall
independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any substantive
conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect of any Antitrust Law
without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or conversation
and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend
or participate. Parent shall take the lead, subject to the Companys right to
participate and consent to material decisions (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), in determining strategy for
and scheduling and conducting any meeting with any Governmental Entity,
coordinating any filings, obtaining any necessary approvals, and resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of any such agency or other Governmental Entity
under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing, each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Shareholders Agent shall perform, or cause to be done and performed, all
such further acts and things, and shall execute and deliver all such other
agreements, certificates, instruments and documents, as the other parties
hereto may reasonably request (at such other parties expense) in order to

with each other and with each partys accounting firms and legal counsel, as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes or pertaining to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Shareholders Agent agrees
(i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Parent, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods,
and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Tax
Authority, and (ii) to give Parent reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if
Parent so requests, the Shareholders Agent shall allow Parent to take
possession of such books and records prior to such transfer, destruction or
discarding. Parent and the Shareholders Agent further agree, upon request, to
use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Tax Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 



 

(f) _Contests_. In the case of any notice of Tax deficiency, proposed Tax
adjustment, Tax assessment, Tax audit, Tax examination or other administrative
or court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim with respect to Taxes (a "
_Tax Claim_ ") relating to any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date
that, if determined adversely to the Company would be grounds for a claim for
indemnity pursuant to this _Section 6.5_, Parent shall upon receipt of such
Tax Claim, promptly, but no later than 15 days, inform the Shareholders Agent
of such Tax Claim and the Shareholders Agent (at its sole cost and expense on
behalf of the Effective Time Holders) shall have the right to control the
conduct of such Tax Claim and shall have the right to settle such Tax Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , (i) that Parent may fully participate in the dispute
of such Tax Claim, (ii) the Shareholders Agent shall keep Parent timely
informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any such Tax
Claim and (iii) the Shareholders Agent shall not settle, compromise or
dispose of any Tax Claim without the consent of Parent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the case of any Tax
Claim relating to the Taxes of any Straddle Period, Parent and the
Shareholders Agent may each participate, at their own expense, in the audit
or proceeding, and the audit or proceeding shall be controlled by Parent or
the Shareholders Agent, whichever would bear the burden of the greatest
portion of the adjustment; _provided_ , _however_ , that the party controlling
the Straddle Period Tax Claim (i) shall not settle such audit or proceeding
without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and (ii) shall keep the other

 



      
 

 



 

party timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of
any such Tax Claim. The failure by Parent to provide the notice contemplated
by this _Section 6.5(f)_ shall not affect the Effective Time Holders
indemnification obligations under _Section 6.5(a)_.

 



 

(g) _Adjustment to Consideration_. Any indemnification payment under this
_Section 6.5_ or _Article IX_ shall, to the extent such payment can be
properly so characterized under applicable Tax law, be treated as an
adjustment to the consideration payable hereunder.

 



 

(h) _Pre-Closing Tax Period Actions_. No Parent Indemnified Person will: (i)
file or amend any Tax Return of the Company or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or (ii) have the
Company or the Surviving Corporation make any Tax election that has
retroactive effect to any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period, or (iii) agree to extend or waive the statute of limitations with
respect to Taxes of the Company or the Surviving Corporation for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period (other than routine or customary extensions), in
each case except (x) as permitted by _Section 6.5(d)_, or (y) with the prior
written consent of the Shareholders Agent (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Except as required by Legal Requirements,
the Company and the Parent, including successors of either, shall take no
action out of the ordinary course that would have the effect of accelerating
income into a Pre-Closing Tax Period or into the portion of a Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date, or deferring a deduction from a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date into a
subsequent period without the prior written consent of the Shareholders Agent
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(i) _Survival of Obligations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.5_ shall be
unconditional and absolute, shall survive until ninety (90) days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for the Taxes in question
and with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.13_, having regard, without limitation to (A) any waiver given by Parent or
the Company in accordance with _Section 6.5(h)_ in respect of the Taxes in
question and (B) any entitlement of a Tax Authority to assess or reassess the
Company in the event of fraud or misrepresentation attributable to neglect,
carelessness or willful default.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Related Party Transactions_. Effective as of the Closing, the
Company and the applicable Effective Time Holder(s) agree that all
intercompany receivables or payables and loans existing and outstanding as of
the Closing Date between the Company and any Related Party shall be settled
(whether in the ordinary course of business or by way of capital contribution,
gift, distribution, dividend or otherwise) or otherwise cancelled. The Company
and the applicable Effective Time Holder (on behalf of itself and its Related
Parties) hereby acknowledge and agree that all contracts, agreements,
commitments and arrangements between the Company and any Related Party,
including the Shareholder Agreements, shall be deemed terminated as of the
Closing Date and of no further force or effect, and the applicable Effective
Time Holder shall cause each such Related Party not to take any action or
assert any claim that is inconsistent with such deemed termination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of employment of any Person with the
Company shall not be affected by this _Section 6.6_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.7 _General Benefits of Continuing Employees_.

 



 

(a) For the twelve (12) month period immediately following the Closing Date,
Parent will provide or cause to be provided to those individuals who are
employed by the Company immediately prior to the Closing and who continue in
their employment with the Company following the Closing (" _Continuing
Employees_ ") employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable
than the employee benefits provided to such employees by the Company
immediately prior to the Closing, and Parent and the Company shall include
each Continuing Employees length of service with the Company for purposes of
vesting and eligibility under any applicable employee benefit plan (and for
severance and paid time off purposes, also for benefit accrual purposes).

 



 

(b) Parent shall cause any and all pre-existing condition (or actively at work
or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under any Parent employee benefit plans and
arrangements to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees, shall provide
them with credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar
payments) made under a benefit plan of the Company during the plan year which
includes the Closing Date for the purposes of satisfying any applicable
deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements under any corresponding
Parent employee benefit plans or arrangements in which they are eligible to
participate after the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) If required to avoid the imposition of Taxes under Section 4999 of the
Code or the loss of deduction under Section 280G of the Code with respect to
any payment or benefit in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Company will (i) solicit from each "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) who has received or
may receive any payment or benefits that would constitute a "parachute
payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code) a waiver of
such disqualified individuals rights to some or all of such payments or
benefits (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") so that all remaining payments
and/or benefits, if any, shall not be "excess parachute payments" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code) and (ii) if such waiver is obtained,
submit to a vote of the Company Shareholders entitled to vote (in a manner
which satisfies all applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, including Q-7 of Section
1.280G-1 of such Treasury Regulations) the rights of any such "disqualified
individual" to receive the Waived 280G Benefits.

 



 

(d) This _Section 6.7_ shall not require the Company or Parent to continue
the employment of any individual following the Closing, nor shall this section
be construed as an amendment of any benefit plan of Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Indemnification Obligations to Directors and Officers of the
Company_.

 



 

(a) During the period ending six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent
will ensure that the Surviving Corporation fulfills its obligations to the
present and former members of the Company Board and present and former
officers of the Company (each, an " _Indemnified D andO_") pursuant to the terms
of the Company Certificate of Incorporation, Company Bylaws and any
indemnification agreements between the Company and an Indemnified DandO set
forth in _Schedule 6.8(a)_ , in each case, as in effect on the date hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) During the period ending six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent
shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms with
respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to such persons
than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (or Parent may
substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the
same coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time);
_provided, however_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to expend more
than an amount per year equal to 250% of current annual premiums paid by the
Company, whether expended over time or paid in a lump sum or otherwise, to
maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant to this _Section 6.8(b)_.

 



 

(c) Each Indemnified DandO shall be deemed a third party beneficiary of this
_Section 6.8_, and this _Section 6.8_ shall be enforceable by each
Indemnified DandO, his or her heirs and his or her representatives.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Information Statement; Shareholder Consent_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, in accordance with the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and the Company Bylaws and the applicable requirements of the
DGCL (including Sections 228 and 262 of the DGCL), (i) prepare an information
statement describing the material terms of this Agreement, the Merger, the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Information Statement_ "), (ii) within ten
(10) days after the date hereof, cause a copy of the Information Statement to
be delivered to the physical or electronic address on record for each Company
Shareholder who is entitled to vote upon adoption of this Agreement, and (iii)
actively solicit from each Company Shareholder who did not sign the
Shareholder Consent as of the date hereof an executed joinder to the
Shareholder Consent and an accredited investor certificate regarding such
Effective Time Holders status as an "accredited investor" as such term is
defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act
(it being understood that each Company Shareholder that executes the
Shareholder Consent shall deliver such certificate with its counterpart
signature page to the Shareholder Consent).

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any Company
Shareholders party to the Voting Agreement have not executed a joinder to the
Shareholder Consent by the time the Information Statement is delivered to the
Company Shareholders, the Information Statement shall include the drag-along
notice contemplated by Section 1.7 of the Voting Agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
shall deliver to Parent the executed Shareholder Consent by 11:59 p.m. (New
York City time) on the date hereof.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Registration of Parent Common Stock_.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, Parent shall prepare, and,
on the later of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) ten (10) Business Days following
the date hereof, Parent

 



      
 

 



 

shall file with the SEC, and cause to be declared automatically and
immediately effective at the time of such filing, one or more registration
statements in compliance with the Securities Act (each, a " _Registration
Statement_ ") covering the resale of all shares of Parent Common Stock that
are to be issued in connection with the payment of the Initial Amount, the
Aggregate Series B Preference, the Aggregate Series A Preference and under the
Series B Additional Purchase Price Agreement (such shares, together with the
shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable hereunder or under the Series
B Additional Purchase Price Agreement, the " _Registrable Stock_ "). On or
prior to the payment date of each Milestone Payment and the PRV Payment, as
applicable, that Parent intends to pay all or in part in Parent Common Stock,
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC, and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause to be declared effective as soon as reasonably practicable
after filing, one or more Registration Statements covering the resale of all
Registrable Stock to be issued in connection with such payment; _provided_
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein other than the
subsequent proviso, in no event may Parent elect to pay any portion of a
payment hereunder in Registrable Stock unless the Registration Statement
covering such Registrable Stock is effective (and not unavailable pursuant to
_Section 6.10(d)_) as of the applicable payment date; _provided_ , _however_
, that if the failure of the Registration Statement to be so effective is the
result of any Effective Time Holders or the Shareholders Agents
noncompliance with this Agreement, Parent shall nevertheless be able to make
such payment in Registrable Stock and the obligation to register such
Registrable Stock shall be suspended until such time as such Effective Time
Holder or the Shareholders Agent is in compliance with this Agreement (upon
which Parent shall cause the applicable Registration Statement to become
effective within three (3) Business Days). Each Registration Statement shall
be (x) on Form S-3 (except if Parent fails to meet one or more of the
registrant requirements specified in General Instruction I.A. on Form S-3,
such registration shall be on another appropriate form in accordance herewith
that allows for the Registrable Stock covered thereby to be registered on a
delayed and continuous basis) or (y) pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the
Securities Act, a prospectus supplement that shall be deemed to be part of an
existing "shelf" registration statement in accordance with Rule 430B under the
Securities Act and shall permit a delayed or continuous offering. Parent shall
cause all Registrable Stock to be listed on NASDAQ and to comply with the
listing requirements of NASDAQ, including all corporate governance
requirements.

 



 

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain the
continuous effectiveness of each Registration Statement (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) until the
earlier of (A) all such shares of Registrable Stock having been sold pursuant
to such Registration Statement or (B) at such time as none of the holders of
Registrable Stock issued thereunder are restricted from transferring such
Registrable Stock under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and (ii) subject to
the Lock-Up Agreements and _Section 6.10(d)_, to take such other actions as
are necessary to permit the Persons who are issued Registrable Stock pursuant
to this Agreement to sell such Registrable Stock without restriction as
promptly as practicable pursuant to such Registration Statements. In the case
of any Registration Statement that is an automatic shelf registration
statement, a new registration statement pursuant to Rule 415(a)(6) with
respect to the Registrable Stock will be deemed to be an amendment to such
Registration Statement for purposes of this _Section 6.10_, and references in
this _Section 6.10_ to a Registration Statement, except in clause (ii) above,
shall include such new registration statement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the filing of the Registration
Statement or any prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, or
comparable statements under securities or state "blue sky" laws of any
jurisdiction, or any free writing prospectus related thereto, or before
sending a response to an SEC comment letter related to the Registration
Statement, Parent shall furnish to the Shareholders Agent copies of
reasonably complete drafts of all such documents proposed to be filed
(including all exhibits thereto and each document incorporated by reference
therein to the extent then required by the rules and regulations of the SEC),
which documents will be subject to the review and comment of the Shareholders
Agent, and Parent shall consider in good faith the changes reasonably
requested by the Shareholders Agent prior to making any such filing.

 



 

(d) With respect to any Registration Statement that has been filed pursuant to
_Section 6.10(a)_, (i) upon the issuance by the SEC of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement or the initiation
of any proceedings for that purpose; (ii) if any Registration Statement or
related prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated
therein by reference shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading (including, in any such case, as a
result of the non-availability of financial statements); or (iii) if, in the
good faith judgment of Parent following consultation with legal counsel, it
would be detrimental to Parent or its stockholders for resales of Registrable
Securities to be made pursuant to the Registration Statement due to (A) the
existence of a material development or potential material development
involving Parent that Parent would be obligated to disclose or incorporate by
reference in the Registration Statement, which disclosure would be premature
or otherwise inadvisable at such time, or (B) interference with an actual or
potential material financing or business combination transaction involving
Parent, (I)(1) in the case of clause (ii) above, but subject to clause (iii)
above, Parent shall as promptly as reasonably practicable prepare and file a
post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement or a supplement to the
related prospectus so that such Registration Statement or prospectus does not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, and in the case of a post-effective amendment to a
Registration Statement, use reasonable best efforts to cause it to become
effective as promptly as reasonably practicable and (2) in the case of clause
(i) above, use reasonable best efforts to cause such stop order to be lifted,
and (II) Parent shall give notice to the Effective Time Holders that the
availability of such Registration Statement is suspended and, upon receipt of
any such notice, each Effective Time Holder agrees that it shall not sell any
of the registered securities pursuant to a Registration Statement until such
Effective Time Holder or the Shareholders Agent is notified by Parent of the
effectiveness of the post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement
provided for in clause (I) above, or until it is notified in writing by Parent
that the Registration Statement may be used. In connection with any
circumstance covered by clause (iii) above, Parent shall be entitled to
exercise its rights pursuant to this _Section 6.10(d)_ to suspend the
availability of the Registration Statement for no more than thirty (30)
consecutive days and an aggregate of sixty (60) days in any 180-day period.
Parent shall promptly notify the Shareholders Agent upon the receipt of any
comment letter or request by the SEC, state securities authority or other
Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any Registration
Statement or the prospectus related thereto or for additional information.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) All fees and expenses incurred by Parent in connection with its
performance of its obligations under or in compliance with this _Section
6.10_ shall be borne by Parent. Each Effective Time Holder shall pay any
expenses incurred by it in connection with the performance of its obligations
under or in compliance with this _Section 6.10_.

 



 

(f) _Indemnification_. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the Shareholder
Indemnified Persons, from and against any Damages to which any Shareholder
Indemnified Person may become subject (under the Securities Act or otherwise)
to the extent such Damages arise out of, directly or indirectly, any untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any
other document filed in accordance with this _Section 6.10_, or any omission
to state therein a fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent will
not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such Damages out of,
directly or indirectly, any untrue statement or omission, made in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to Parent by or on
behalf of the Company, prior to the Closing, the Shareholders Agent or such
Effective Time Holder specifically for use in the preparation of the
Registration Statement or any other registration statement filed in accordance
with this _Section 6.10_. The Effective Time Holders, on a several basis,
shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, the Parent Indemnified Persons to the same
extent as the foregoing indemnity from Parent, but only with reference to
information furnished in writing to Parent, the Company or the Shareholders
Agent specifically for use in the preparation of the Registration Statement or
any other registration statement filed in accordance with this _Section
6.10_. _Section 9.4_ shall apply, _mutatis mutandis_ , to any claim for
indemnification under this _Section 6.10(f)_.

 



 

(g) Each Effective Time Holder (i) shall furnish to Parent such information
regarding themselves, their relationship to Parent and its Affiliates, their
beneficial ownership of Parent Common Stock, the Registrable Stock held by
them, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as is required
to be included under the Securities Act in a Registration Statement (or any
amendment thereto) or any prospectus with respect to such Effective Time
Holder, (ii) shall comply with the prospectus delivery requirements under the
Securities Act in connection with the sale or other distribution of
Registrable Stock pursuant to a Registration Statement, and (iii) shall report
to Parent all sales or other distributions by such Effective Time Holder of
Registrable Stock pursuant to a Registration Statement. No Effective Time
Holder shall use any free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act) in connection with the sale of Registrable Securities without
the prior written consent of Parent. It shall be a condition precedent to the
obligations of Parent to take any action pursuant to this _Section 6.10_ with
respect to the Registrable Stock of any selling Effective Time Holder that
such selling Effective Time Holder furnish to Parent the information required
by clause (i) above within a reasonable time prior to Parents obligation to
file such Registration Statement.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Series B Additional Purchase Price Agreement_. On the date
hereof, Parent is entering into an agreement with certain of the holders of
Series B Preferred Stock, for the benefit of all of the holders of Series B
Preferred Stock (the " _Series B Additional Purchase Price Agreement_"),
pursuant to which Parent, in connection with payment of the Aggregate Series B
Preference Amount, Initial Amount and any Milestone Payments hereunder, shall
make additional payments in the aggregate amount of up to $27,000,000 directly
to the holders of

 



      
 

 



 

Series B Preferred Stock if the Closing occurs on or prior to the first (1st)
anniversary of the Companys issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock.

Section 9.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) Any Parent Indemnified Person seeking any indemnification under _Section
9.2(a)_ or Shareholder Indemnified Person seeking any indemnification under
_Section 9.3(a)_ (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ "), acting through Parent
or the Shareholders Agent, as applicable, shall give the party from whom
indemnification is being sought (which, in the case of an Effective Time
Holder, shall be represented by the Shareholders Agent) (an " _Indemnifying
Person_ ") prompt notice (a

 



      
 

 



 

" _Claim Notice_ ") of any matter which such Indemnified Person has determined
has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under _Section
9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.3(a)_, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , if an
Indemnified Person shall receive written notice of any third party claim
(other than any claim relating to Taxes, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which such
Indemnified Person believes may result in a demand for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.3(a)_, as applicable, the
Indemnified Person, acting through Parent or the Shareholders Agent, as
applicable, shall give the Indemnifying Person a Claim Notice within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt by the Indemnified Person of such notice. The
Claim Notice shall (i) indicate whether the Indemnity Claim results from or
arises out of a Third Party Claim or a direct claim, (ii) describe with
reasonable specificity the nature of the Indemnity Claim and (iii) state the
amount of Damages sought pursuant to such Indemnity Claim to the extent then
known. The failure to deliver or timely deliver the Claim Notice shall not
affect the rights of the Indemnified Person to indemnification under _Section
9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.3(a)_, as applicable, except and only to the extent
that the Indemnifying Persons shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced by reason of such failure.

 



 

(b) _Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(i) Subject to _Section 9.4(b)(ii)_, the Indemnifying Person shall have the
right to conduct at the Indemnifying Persons expense the defense of a Third
Party Claim, upon delivery of notice to the applicable Indemnified Person (the
" _Defense Notice_ ") within ten (10) days after the Indemnifying Persons
receipt of the Claim Notice; _provided_ that the Defense Notice shall specify
the counsel the Indemnifying Person will appoint to defend such Third Party
Claim and acknowledge, without qualification, the right of such Indemnified
Person to be indemnified for Damages incurred in connection with such Third
Party Claim. The applicable Indemnified Person shall be entitled to be
indemnified for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for any period
during which the Indemnifying Person has not assumed the defense of any such
Third Party Claim in accordance herewith. If the Indemnifying Person delivers
a Defense Notice and thereby elects to conduct the defense of the Third Party
Claim, such Indemnified Person will cooperate with and make available to the
Indemnifying Person such assistance and materials as the Indemnifying Person
may reasonably request, all at the sole expense of the Indemnifying Person,
and the Indemnified Person shall have the right at its expense to participate
in the defense assisted by counsel of its own choosing, subject to the control
of the Indemnifying Person.

 



 

(ii) The Indemnifying Person shall not be entitled to control the defense of
any Third Party Claim if (i) in the case of any Indemnity Claim by a Parent
Indemnified Person, such Indemnity Claim is with respect to a Proceeding (A)
by a Governmental Entity, (B) regarding material Company Intellectual
Property, or (C) that would reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) it is reasonably likely the Damages for such
Indemnity Claim will exceed the cap set forth in _Section 9.2(b)(iii)_ or
_9.3(b)(iii)_ , if applicable, (iii) the applicable Indemnified Person has
been advised by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a material
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Persons and such Indemnified
Person with respect to such Third Party Claim, (iv) the Indemnifying Person
has failed to deliver the Defense Notice or is failing to adequately prosecute
or defend such Third Party Claim, or (v) such Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction or other equitable relief against such Indemnified Person.

 



       
 

 



 

(iii) In the event that the Indemnifying Person does not assume the control of
the defense of a Third Party Claim or is not entitled to control the defense
of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have the right at its
expense to participate in the defense assisted by counsel of its own choosing,
subject to the control of the Indemnified Person. If the fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Person are determined to be recoverable Damages in
accordance herewith, in no event shall the Indemnifying Persons be responsible
for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any
required local counsel).

 



 

(iv) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to settle or compromise any
Third Party Claim if it is otherwise not entitled to control the defense of
such Third Party Claim. With respect to Third Party Claims which the
Indemnifying Party is entitle to control the defense of, the Indemnifying
Person shall not, without the prior written consent of the applicable
Indemnified Person (i) settle or compromise a Third Party Claim or consent to
the entry of any Proceeding which does not include an unconditional release by
the claimant or plaintiff of such Indemnified Person from all liability in
respect of the Third Party Claim; (ii) settle or compromise any Third Party
Claim if the settlement imposes equitable remedies or other obligations on
such Indemnified Person; or (iii) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim
if the result is to admit civil or criminal liability or culpability on the
part of such Indemnified Person that could give rise to criminal liability
with respect to such Indemnified Person. If the Indemnifying Person has not
assumed the control of the defense of a Third Party Claim or is not entitled
to control the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall
have the right, subject to _Section 9.4(b)(iii)_, to defend such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Person shall not settle,
compromise or discharge, or admit any liability with respect to, any such
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Person
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

Section 9.5 _Shareholders  Agent_.

 



 

(a) The Effective Time Holders, by approving this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, are deemed to irrevocably appoint and
constitute Fortis Advisors LLC as the Shareholders Agent and as the true and
lawful attorney-in-fact and exclusive agent for and on behalf of the Effective
Time Holders to execute and deliver this Agreement and for all other purposes
hereunder, to give and receive notices and communications, to object to such
deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to such claims, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
and provide amendments and supplements to and waivers in respect of this
Agreement, in accordance with this _Section 9.5_ and _Section 9.6_, to
exercise all available rights and remedies of the Effective Time Holders under
_Section 2.11_ and otherwise to take all actions necessary or appropriate in
the judgment of the Shareholders Agent for the accomplishment of any or all
of the foregoing or in furtherance of the rights and obligations of the
Effective Time Holders under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Shareholders Agent shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the
Effective Time Holders, except as expressly provided herein, and for purposes
of clarity, there are no obligations of the Shareholders Agent in any
ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Company Disclosure

 



      
 

 



 

Schedule. Such agency may be changed by the holders of a majority of the
Proportionate Shares from time to time upon not less than ten (10) days prior
written notice to all of the Effective Time Holders and to Parent. No bond
shall be required of the Shareholders Agent. Notices or communications to or
from the Shareholders Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Effective Time Holders under this Agreement. The Shareholders Agent shall be
entitled to: (i) rely upon the Consideration Spreadsheet; (ii) rely upon any
signature believed by it to be genuine; and (iii) reasonably assume that a
signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable
Effective Time Holder or other party. The powers, immunities and rights to
indemnification granted to the Shareholders Agent Group (as defined below)
hereunder: (x) are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and
survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of the respective
Effective Time Holder and shall be binding on any successor thereto; and (y)
shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Effective Time Holder of
the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in any Milestone Payment
or the PRV Payment.

 



 

(b) Certain Effective Time Holders have entered into an engagement agreement
with the Shareholders Agent to provide direction to the Shareholders Agent
in connection with the performance of its services under this Agreement (such
Effective Time Holders, including their individual representatives,
collectively hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). Neither the
Shareholders Agent nor its members, managers, directors, officers,
contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory Group
(collectively, the " _Shareholders  Agent Group_") shall be liable for any
act done or omitted hereunder as Shareholders Agent while acting in good
faith and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Effective Time Holders shall
severally, in accordance with their respective Proportionate Shares, indemnify
the Shareholders Agent Group and defend and hold it harmless against any
loss, liability, claim, damage, fee, cost, judgment, fine, amount paid in
settlement or expense (including fees, disbursements and costs of counsel and
other skilled professionals and in connection with seeking recovery from
insurers) incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Shareholders Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of his duties hereunder, (the " _Agent Expenses_ "). To the
extent the Shareholders Agent Reserve Amount is unavailable, the
Shareholders Agent shall have the right to recover Agent Expenses first, from
the cash portion of any Milestone Payment or the PRV Payment otherwise
distributable to the Effective Time Holders at the time of distribution and
second, directly from the Effective Time Holders. The Effective Time Holders
acknowledge that the Shareholders Agent shall not be required to expend or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise
or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or
administration of its duties. The immunities and rights to indemnification
shall survive the resignation or removal of the Shareholders Agent or any
member of the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) At the Closing, Parent shall deliver the Shareholders Agent Reserve
Amount to an account designated by the Shareholders Agent. The Shareholders
Agent Reserve Amount shall be controlled solely by the Shareholders Agent,
which shall use such amount solely to pay the reasonable costs and expenses,
if any, incurred by it in the performance of its obligations as Shareholders
Agent hereunder or under any Shareholders Agent letter agreement. The
Shareholders Agent is not providing any investment supervision,

 



      
 

 



 

recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for
any loss of principal of the Shareholders Agent Reserve other than as a
result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Shareholders Agent
is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection
with the Shareholders Agent Reserve, and has no tax reporting or income
distribution obligations hereunder. At such time as the Shareholders Agent
determines, it shall deliver to the Exchange Agent the amount, if any,
remaining in the Shareholders Agent Reserve Amount, and the Exchange Agent
shall disburse such amount to the Effective Time Holders as provided in
_Sections 2.9_ and _2.10_. For Tax purposes, Parent shall be deemed to have
paid the Effective Time Holders their respective Proportionate Shares of the
Shareholders Agent Reserve Amount, and the Effective Time Holders shall be
deemed to have voluntarily contributed such amount to the Shareholders Agent
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, any information reporting and tax
withholding with respect to any portion of the Shareholders Agent Reserve
Amount that is returned to any Effective Time Holder shall be the
responsibility of the Shareholders Agent).

 



 

(d) The Shareholders Agent represents and warrants to the Company and Parent
that (i) it has full corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, (ii) the execution and
delivery by the Shareholders Agent of this Agreement has been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate or similar action and no other proceedings are
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and (iii)
this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Shareholders Agent and, assuming due authorization and delivery by the
Company and Parent, is a valid and binding agreement, enforceable against the
Shareholders Agent in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by the effect, if any, of (A) any applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other Legal Requirements
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, and (B) general
principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding at law or in equity.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Actions of the Shareholders  Agent_. A decision, act, consent or
instruction, in each case in writing, of the Shareholders Agent shall
constitute a decision of all of the Effective Time Holders and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each and every Effective Time Holder, and Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders Agent as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every Effective Time Holder.
Parent is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done
by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholders Agent.

 



 

Section 9.7 _No Right of Contribution_. Neither the Shareholders Agent nor
any Effective Time Holder shall make any claim for contribution from the
Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any indemnity claims
arising under or in connection with this Agreement to the extent that Parent,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Parent Indemnified Person is
entitled to indemnification under _Section 6.5(a)_, _Section 6.10(f)_ or
_Section 9.2(a)_ for such claim, and the Shareholders Agent, on its own
behalf and on behalf of all Effective Time Holders, hereby waives any such
right of contribution from the Company or the Surviving Corporation it has or
may have in the future.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Set-Off_. Parent and the Effective Time Holders hereby expressly
acknowledge and agree that Parent shall have the right [***].

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.9 _Alternative Reimbursement_. The amount of any Damages subject to
indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)_ and _Section 9.3(a)_ shall be
calculated net of any insurance proceeds, indemnity, contribution or other
payment actually recovered by the Indemnified Person from any third party with
respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no Indemnified Person shall
be required to pursue insurance or other collateral sources to offset such
Damages, except that an Indemnified Person shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to avail itself of available insurance policies to the same extent as
it would if such Damages were not subject to indemnification hereunder, and
(ii) the amount of such recovery shall be reduced by any costs and expenses
incurred in obtaining such recovery and by the amount of any increase in
insurance premiums resulting from making the claim giving rise to such
recovery. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any
Indemnified Person with respect to any Damages for which any such Indemnified
Person has been indemnified hereunder, then the Indemnified Person shall
promptly pay to the Indemnifying Person the amount of such recovery, but in no
event shall the amount of such payment to the Indemnifying Person exceed the
amount of the indemnification payment made to the Indemnified Person.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Mitigation_. Nothing in this _Article IX_ regarding
indemnification rights and obligations shall be deemed to override any
obligations with respect to mitigation of Damages existing under applicable
Legal Requirements.

 



 

Section 9.11 _Effect of Investigation; Reliance_. The right to
indemnification, payment of Damages or any other remedy will not be affected
by any investigation conducted, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time (except as expressly disclosed in this Agreement or the
Company Disclosure Schedule as of the date hereof), whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by any party hereto. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any such representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Damages, or any other remedy based on any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. No Indemnified Person shall
be required to show reliance on any representation, warranty, certificate or
other agreement in order for such Indemnified Person to be entitled to
indemnification hereunder.

way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The definitions contained
in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms
of such terms. The Exhibits to this Agreement and the Company Disclosure
Schedule are hereby incorporated and made a part hereof and are an integral
part of this Agreement, and the Company Disclosure Schedule is subject to the
rules of construction and interpretation set forth therein. Any capitalized
terms used in any schedule or exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall
be defined as set forth in this Agreement. Any reference in this Agreement to
"$" or "dollars" means United States dollars, unless expressly stated
otherwise.

 



 

Section 10.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by PDF or other electronic transmission), all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties hereto, it being understood that all parties
hereto need not sign the same counterpart.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest_. This
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements specifically referred to herein or therein or delivered
pursuant hereto, including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, including the
Company Disclosure Schedule: (i) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, (ii) except as specifically
stated in _Section 6.8_ with respect to the Indemnified DandOs, shall not
create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person
not a party to this Agreement or such other agreement (it being understood and
agreed that nothing herein shall limit the right of the Shareholders Agent to
enforce this Agreement on behalf of the Effective Time Holders following the
Closing), (iii) except by operation of the Merger, shall not be assigned
except as otherwise specifically provided; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent may (a) assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one
or more of its Affiliates, (b) designate one or more of its Affiliates to
perform its obligations hereunder, and (c) assign its rights and interests
hereunder pursuant to _Section 2.11(f)_ (in any or all of the cases set forth
in clauses (a), (b) and (c), Parent nonetheless shall remain responsible for
the performance of all of its obligations hereunder), and (iv) shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns (which permitted assigns, in the
case of Parent, shall be its Affiliates only or as provided in _Section
2.11(f)_).

 



 

Section 10.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto
further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Governing Law; Venue_. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN _SECTION 2.8(D)_
OR _SECTION 2.11(E)_ WITH RESPECT TO RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN DISPUTES RELATING
TO ANY CLOSING EXCESS CASH AMOUNT ADJUSTMENT OR MILESTONE PAYMENTS,
RESPECTIVELY, BY THE ACCOUNTANTS, THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF
THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS
OF LAWS THEREOF. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF THE CHANCERY COURT OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE OR, IF SUCH COURT DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION, THE UNITED STATES
DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER
BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MATTERS CONTEMPLATED
HEREIN, AGREES THAT PROCESS MAY BE SERVED UPON THEM IN ANY MANNER AUTHORIZED
BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE FOR SUCH PERSONS, AND WAIVES AND
COVENANTS NOT TO ASSERT OR PLEAD ANY OBJECTION THAT THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE
TO SUCH JURISDICTION AND SUCH PROCESS.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.7 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES (TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW) ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE
PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE
MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING, AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY
SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED
AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution
of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and that the parties hereto shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or
equity and without proof of actual damages or the requirement to post bond;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Closing,
_Article IX_ shall govern with respect to Indemnity Claims and this _Section
10.9_ is subject to _Section 9.2(f)_ and _9.3(e)_.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Conflict of Interest_. If the Shareholders Agent so desires,
acting on behalf of the Effective Time Holders and without the need for any
consent or waiver by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, Cooley LLP ("
_Cooley_ ") shall be permitted to represent any of the Effective Time Holders
after the Closing in connection with any matter, including without limitation,
anything related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any other
agreements referenced herein or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, Cooley
shall be permitted to represent any of the Effective Time Holders or any of
their agents or Affiliates, or any one or more of them, in connection with any
negotiation, transaction or dispute (including any litigation, arbitration or
other adversary proceeding) with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their agents or Affiliates under or relating to this Agreement, any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and any related matter, such as
claims or disputes arising under other agreements entered into in connection
with this Agreement, including with respect to any Indemnity Claims. Upon and
after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall cease to have any future
attorney-client relationship with Cooley, unless and to the extent Cooley is
specifically engaged in writing by the Surviving Corporation to represent the
Surviving Corporation after the Closing and either such engagement involves no
conflict of interest with respect to the Effective Time Holders or the
Shareholders Agent consents in writing at the time to such engagement. Any
such representation of the Surviving Corporation by Cooley after the Closing
shall not affect the foregoing provisions hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.11 _Attorney-Client Privilege; Merger-Related Materials_. The
attorney-client privilege of the Company prior to the Closing related to the
Merger shall be deemed to be the right of the Effective Time Holders, and not
that of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation),
following the Closing, and may be waived only by the Shareholders Agent.
Absent the consent of the Shareholders Agent, neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) shall have a right, following
the Closing, to access and make use of any attorney-client privileged or other
material of the Company related to (a) the consideration of a strategic
transaction that ultimately led to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, including any communications, documents or files relating to the
preparation or negotiation of this Agreement, the documents referred to herein
or the transactions contemplated hereby or (b) the performance by the Company
of this Agreement prior to the Closing; _provided_ that the foregoing does not
waive or excuse Cooley from complying with all applicate rules of professional
conduct regarding the confidentiality of any client information of the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute arises between Parent or
any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation), on the one hand,
and a third party other than (and unaffiliated with) the Effective Time
Holders and the Shareholders Agent, on the other hand, after the Closing,
then Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) may
assert such attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure to such third
party of confidential communications by Cooley; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) may not waive
such privilege without the prior written consent of the Shareholders Agent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 

       
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the Shareholders
Agent have caused this Agreement to be executed and delivered by their
respective duly authorized officers, all as of the date first written above.
