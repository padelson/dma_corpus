laws of the State of Israel and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Sub"), and Frutarom Industries Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the
State of Israel (the "Company"). Defined terms used in this Agreement have the
respective meanings ascribed to them herein. 

_W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent (the "Parent Board"),
the Company (the "Company Board") and Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Board")
have approved, the sole shareholder of Merger Sub has approved and, in the
case of the Company Board and the Merger Sub Board, declared advisable, fair
and in the best interests of such entity and its respective shareholders,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company surviving
as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger"), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the provisions of Sections 314-327 of the Companies Law 5759-1999 of
the State of Israel (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the
"ICL");

WHEREAS, the Company Board and the Merger Sub Board have determined that,
considering the financial conditions of the merging companies, no reasonable
concern exists that the Surviving Company (as defined below) will be unable to
fulfill the obligations of the Company or the Merger Sub, as applicable, to
its creditors;

WHEREAS, the Company Board has unanimously resolved to recommend that the
Companys shareholders approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Parent to enter into this
Agreement and as an inducement in consideration therefor, concurrently with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent and certain shareholders
of the Company are entering into a Voting Agreement pursuant to which each
such shareholder is agreeing, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to
vote its Company Ordinary Shares in favor of the approval of the Merger, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and 

WHEREAS, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties and covenants and subject to the conditions herein contained, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties
hereto hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER_

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the ICL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
(as the target company ( _Chevrat_ ___Ha_ __ _Ya_ __ _ad_ ) in the Merger)
shall be merged with and into the Company (as the absorbing company (
_HaChevra_ _ _ _Ha_ __ _Koletet_ ) in the Merger), whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the
surviving company of the Merger (the "Surviving Company") and shall (a)
become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, (b) continue to be governed by the
Laws of the State of Israel, (c) maintain a registered office in the State of
Israel and (d) succeed to and assume all of the rights, properties and
obligations of Merger Sub and the Company in accordance with the ICL.

Section 1.2 _The Closing_. Subject to the provisions of _Article VI_, the
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Naschitz, Brandes, Amir and Co., 5 Tuval Street, Tel Aviv, Israel, at 9:00 a.m.
(local time), on a date to be specified by the parties hereto, but no later
than the third (3rd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied by action to be taken at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the party entitled to waive such
conditions), unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto (such date being the "Closing Date").

 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable after the determination
of the date on which the Closing is to take place, each of the Company and
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), in coordination with
each other, deliver to the Registrar of Companies of the State of Israel (the
"Companies Registrar") a notice of the contemplated Merger which shall inform
the Companies Registrar that all conditions to the Merger under the ICL and
this Agreement have been met and set forth the proposed date of the Closing on
which the Companies Registrar is requested to issue a certificate evidencing
the Merger in accordance with Section 323(5) of the ICL (the "Certificate of
Merger") after notice that the Closing has occurred is served to the Companies
Registrar, which the parties shall deliver on the Closing Date. The Merger
shall become effective upon the issuance by the Companies Registrar of the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with Section 323(5) of the ICL (such date
and time being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the ICL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of, and simultaneously with, the Merger and without
any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any
shareholder of the Company, (i) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the Surviving Company, (ii) all the properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Company, (iii) all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Company and (iv) all the rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises of the Company (as the Surviving Company) shall continue
unaffected by the Merger in accordance with the ICL.

 



 



-2- Section 1.5 _Articles of Association_. The articles of association of Merger

_Section 5.9_.

 

Section 1.6 _Board of Directors; Officers_. The members of the Merger Sub
Board immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the members of the board of directors of the Surviving
Company, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than the members of the Company Board) shall, from and after
the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Company, in each case to
hold office in accordance with the articles of association of the Surviving
Company until the earlier of their respective death, resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected, designated and qualified.

Section 1.7 _Operations_. For a period of at least three (3) years from the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company intend to maintain the

canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ or to be converted in
accordance with _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_) shall be converted into the right to
receive from Parent, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (A)
$71.19 per share in cash (such amount of cash, the "Cash Consideration") and
(B) 0.2490 (the "Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
shares of common stock, par value $0.125 per share, of Parent (the "Parent
Common Stock") (and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock payable in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_) (such shares
of Parent Common Stock and any such cash in lieu of fractional shares,
together with the Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"), in each
case without interest and subject to applicable Tax withholding. Each Company
Ordinary Share to be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this _Section 2.1(a)(i) _shall no longer be
outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and
the 

 



-3-  holders of certificates (the "Certificates") or book-entry shares ("Book-
Entry Shares"), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Company Ordinary Shares, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Ordinary Shares other than the right to receive, upon surrender of
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 2.3_, the
Merger Consideration.

(ii) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock (Dormant Shares) and Parent-Owned Company
Ordinary Shares_. Each Company Ordinary Share held by the Company as treasury
stock (dormant shares) or held directly or indirectly by Parent or Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be
due or delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof.

(iii) _Company Ordinary Shares Held by Subsidiaries_. Each Company Ordinary
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is
held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall be converted into and
become such number of fully paid and nonassessable ordinary shares, par value
one New Israeli Shekel (NIS 1.00) per share, of the Surviving Company such
that the ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Company
immediately following the Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage
of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(iv) _Conversion of Merger Sub Share Capital_. Each ordinary share, par value
one New Israeli Shekel (NIS 1.00) per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one (1) fully paid ordinary share, par value one New Israeli
Shekel (NIS 1.00) per share, of the Surviving Company and, together with the
ordinary shares referred to in _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, shall constitute the
only outstanding share capital of the Surviving Company.

(b) _Adjustments_.

 

(i) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
any change in the number or type of outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
or Company Ordinary Shares shall occur as a result of a reclassification,
recapitalization, exchange, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
combination or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend or stock
distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration
and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Ordinary Shares the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.
Nothing in this _Section 2.1(b)_ shall be construed to permit any party to
take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other
provision of this Agreement.

(ii) If the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ and
pursuant to _Section 2.2_) (the "Aggregate Stock Consideration") would exceed
19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock immediately
prior to the entry into this

 



-4-  Agreement (as set forth on Section 2.1(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter),
rounded down to the nearest whole share (the "Maximum Share Number"), (i) the
Exchange Ratio shall be reduced (the amount of such reduction, the "Exchange
Ratio Reduction Number") by the minimum extent necessary such that the
Aggregate Stock Consideration does not exceed the Maximum Share Number and
(ii) the Cash Consideration for all purposes under this Agreement will be
increased on a per share basis by an amount in cash equal to the Exchange
Ratio Reduction Number multiplied by the Parent Stock Price.

 

(c) _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Ordinary Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any Parent Common Stock or to
vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. All
fractional shares that a holder of Company Ordinary Shares would be otherwise
entitled to receive shall be aggregated. In lieu of any such fractional
shares, each holder of Company Ordinary Shares who would otherwise be entitled
to such fractional shares shall be entitled to receive from Parent an amount
in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the
product of (i) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder would, but for this _Section
2.1(c)_, be entitled to receive under _Section 2.1(a)(i)_ and (ii) the Parent
Stock Price. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Ordinary Shares in lieu of any
fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to make available such amount, without interest, to the holders
of Company Ordinary Shares entitled to receive such cash.

Section 2.2 _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Vested Company Options_. As of the Effective Time, each
compensatory option to purchase Company Ordinary Shares that is not a Company
Restricted Stock Award (as defined below) (each, a "Company Option") that is
outstanding and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
"Vested Company Option") shall be canceled without any action on the part of
any holder thereof in consideration for the right of the holder to receive the
Merger Consideration (which shall be paid in accordance with _Section
2.3(h)_) in respect of each Net Option Share subject to such Vested Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Vested Option
Consideration"), subject to applicable Tax withholding. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Net Option Share" means, with respect to a Company Option, the
quotient of (i) the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the value of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Company Ordinary Share
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, 
_multiplied by_ (B) the number of Company Ordinary Shares subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, _divided by_ (ii) the
value of the Merger Consideration. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, the value of the Merger Consideration that consists of shares of
Parent Common Stock shall equal the product of (x) the number of such shares
of Parent Common Stock _multiplied by_ (y) the Parent Stock Price.

 



-5- (b) _Treatment of Unvested Company Options_.

 

(i) As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an "Unvested
Company Option") shall be cancelled without any action on the part of any
holder thereof in consideration for the right of the holder to receive, either
(A) on the applicable vesting date that applies to such Unvested Company
Option, subject to the holders continued employment with the Company or an
Affiliate through such date, or (B) upon an earlier termination of the
holders employment that would result in the vesting of such Unvested Company
Option under the terms of any applicable Contract, except as otherwise
provided in _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_ below, a cash payment in U.S. dollars equal
to the value of the Merger Consideration in respect of each Net Option Share
subject to such Unvested Company Option as of the applicable vesting date or
termination date (the "Unvested Option Consideration", and together with the
Vested Option Consideration, the "Option Consideration"), subject to
applicable Tax withholding. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the value
of the Merger Consideration that consists of shares of Parent Common Stock
shall equal the product of (x) the number of such shares of Parent Common
Stock _multiplied by_ (y) the Parent Stock Price. For the avoidance of doubt,
except as provided in this _Section 2.2(b)_, the right of each holder of an
Unvested Company Option to receive the payment described in this Section
2.2(b) will be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions
(including the applicable vesting schedule) as were applicable to the Unvested
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the same
vesting restrictions and continued service requirements and the same rights to
vesting upon a qualifying termination of employment to the extent applicable.

 

(ii) If the Company is unable to obtain the Options Tax Ruling with respect to
the cancellation and exchange of Unvested Company Options that are Company
102 Options in accordance with Section 2.2(b)(i) prior to the Closing Date,
then, instead of the cash payment described in Section 2.2(b)(i), each holder
of an Unvested Company Option that is a Company 102 Option will be entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each Net Option Share. Any
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_ shall be
considered "Unvested Option Consideration" for all purposes of this Agreement
and shall be payable subject to all of the same terms and conditions described
in Section 2.2(b)(i).

(c)  _Vested Company Restricted Stock Awards_. As of the Effective Time, each
compensatory award relating to Company Ordinary Shares that is designated as a
restricted stock award in the applicable award agreement (each, a
"Company Restricted Stock Award") that is outstanding and vested immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Vested Company Restricted Stock Award")
shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder thereof in
consideration for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (which shall
be paid in accordance with _Section 2.3(h)_) in respect of each Net
Restricted Share subject to such Vested Company Restricted Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Vested Restricted Stock
Consideration"), subject to applicable Tax withholding. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Net Restricted Share" means, with respect to a Company Restricted
Stock Award, the quotient of (i) the product of (A) the excess, if any, of
the value of the Merger Consideration

 



-6-  over the purchase price per Company Ordinary Share subject to such Company
Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (B)
the number of Company Ordinary Shares subject to such Company Restricted
Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, _divided by_ (ii) the
value of the Merger Consideration. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the
value of the Merger Consideration that consists of shares of Parent Common
Stock shall equal the product of (x) the number of such shares of Parent
Common Stock _multiplied by_ (y) the Parent Stock Price.

 

(d) _Unvested Company Restricted Stock Awards_. As of the Effective Time, each
Company Restricted Stock Award that is outstanding and unvested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an "Unvested Company Restricted
Stock Award") shall be cancelled without any action on the part of the holder
thereof in consideration for the right of the holder to receive, on the
applicable vesting date that applies to such Unvested Company Restricted Stock
Award, subject to the holders continued employment with the Company or an
Affiliate through such date, a cash payment in U.S. dollars equal to the
value of the Merger Consideration in respect of each Net Restricted Share
subject to such Unvested Restricted Stock Award as of the applicable vesting
date, subject to applicable Tax withholding. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, the value of the Merger Consideration that consists of shares of
Parent Common Stock shall equal the product of (x) the number of such shares
of Parent Common Stock _multiplied by_ (y) the Parent Stock Price. For the
avoidance of doubt, except as provided in this _Section 2.2(d)_, the right
of each holder of an Unvested Company Restricted Stock Award to receive the
payment described in this _Section 2.2(d)_ will be subject to substantially
the same terms and conditions (including the applicable vesting schedule) as
were applicable to the Unvested Company Restricted Stock Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including the same vesting restrictions and
continued service requirements.

 

(e) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or a
committee thereof shall adopt applicable resolutions to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.2_. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Company shall not take any action after the date hereof that would
accelerate the vesting of the Company Options or the Company Restricted
Stock Awards.

Section 2.3 _Payment Procedures._

 

(a) _Designation of Exchange Agent and Information Agent; Deposit of Exchange
Fund_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall (i) enter into an exchange
agreement in customary form and reasonably satisfactory to the Company with
the transfer agent of Parent, the transfer agent of the Company or another
financial institution or trust company designated by Parent that is recognized
in Israel and the United States and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.1(a)(i)_ and (ii) at the request of the Company, engage an
information agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Information
Agent") to assist, _inter alia_ , in obtaining any requisite residency
certificate and/or other declaration for Tax withholding purposes and,
in connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Information
Agent in customary form and reasonably satisfactory to the Company. Prior to
or substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for payment to the holders of
Company Ordinary Shares (excluding Company Ordinary Shares

 



-7-  issued upon previous exercise or settlement of Company 102 Options and are
held by the 102 Trustee ("Company 102 Shares") in respect of which payment
shall be transferred directly to the 102 Trustee) in accordance with this
_Article II_ through the Exchange Agent, (A) book-entry shares representing
the full number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)(i)_ in exchange for outstanding Company Ordinary Shares, (B)
cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the Cash Consideration portion of
the aggregate Merger Consideration and (C) cash in an aggregate amount
necessary to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
_Section 2.1(c)_, and Parent shall, after the Effective Time on or prior to
the appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be provided
to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on such
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ (such aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and aggregate amount of cash provided
to the Exchange Agent, together with any such dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund"). In the event the
Exchange Fund shall at any time be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by _Section 2.1(a)(i)_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause
to be deposited, additional shares or cash funds, as applicable, with the
Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 2.1_.

(b) _Payment Procedures with Respect to Company Ordinary Shares_.

 

(i) Promptly following the Effective Time, and in no event later than the
fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to

converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)(i)_ (in each case, other than (x) Company 102 Shares and (y)
Company Ordinary Shares subject to Company Restricted Stock Awards, which, for
the avoidance of doubt, will be eligible to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Sections 2.2(d)_ and _2.3(h)_ , and not _Section
2.3(b)_), (A) in the case of such holders of Certificates, a letter of
transmittal in customary form and reasonably satisfactory to the Company
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.5_ below),
to the Exchange Agent), (B) a declaration in which the beneficial owner of
Company Ordinary Shares provides certain information necessary for Parent to
determine whether any amounts need to be withheld from the Merger
Consideration payable to such beneficial owner pursuant to the terms of the
Ordinance (subject to the provisions of _Section 2.4_ and _Section 5.15)_,
the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local, Israeli, U.S. or
foreign Law and (C) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in exchange for (1) cash in an amount equal
to the Cash Consideration _multiplied by_ the number of Company Ordinary
Shares represented by such Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares, (2) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder
has the right to receive in respect of such Certificates and/or Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_, (3) any dividends or other

affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with a letter of transmittal, the declaration for Tax withholding
purposes and/or a Valid Tax Certificate, in each case, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as
promptly as reasonably practicable (A) cash in an amount equal to the Cash
Consideration multiplied by the number of Company Ordinary Shares previously
represented by such Certificate, (B) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (which shall be in book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the
whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of
such Certificate pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_, (iii) any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ and (D) any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section
2.1(c)_, if applicable, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled.

(iii) In the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon receipt of the declaration for
Tax withholding purposes and/or a Valid Tax Certificate, in each case, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in
exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable (A) cash in an amount
equal to the Cash Consideration _multiplied by_ the number of Company
Ordinary Shares previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares, (B) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder

pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ and (D) any cash in lieu of fractional shares

and the Book-Entry Shares so exchanged shall be forthwith canceled.

 

(iv) Until surrendered, in the case of a Certificate, or paid, in the case of
a Book-Entry Share, in each case, as contemplated by this _Section 2.3(b)_,
each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Section 2.3(b)_ and any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_. The Exchange Agent
shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and
make such payments and deliveries with respect to Book-Entry Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable hereunder. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
accept such Certificates and transferred Book-Entry Shares upon compliance
with the foregoing exchange procedures. Cash payment to be made under this
_Section 2.3(b)_ shall be made in U.S. Dollars as promptly as practicable
after receipt by the Exchange Agent of such Certificates or Book-Entry

 



-9-  Shares; _provided_ that the parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to make available an election for holders
to receive payments of cash in NIS at the Exchange Agents then applicable
currency exchange rates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 2.3(b)_, any Merger Consideration payable in respect of Company 102
Shares shall be transferred by Parent to the 102 Trustee in accordance with
_Section 2.3(h)_.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Subject to
applicable Law, there shall be paid to the holder of the Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange for Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to _Section
2.3(b)_, without interest, (i) at the time of delivery of such Parent Common
Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_, the amount of
dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common
Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time but
prior to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent
pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_, and a payment date subsequent to such delivery
of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section
2.3(b)_, payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(d) If payment of the Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by 
_Section 2.3(c)_) is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (i) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise
in proper form for transfer (or the Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be
in proper form for transfer) and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by _Section 2.3(c)_) to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share (as applicable) surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not required
to be paid.

 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its
designee upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent as general creditors thereof for payment, without interest, of their
claims for Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by _Section 2.3(c)_.

 

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash held in the
Exchange Fund delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant to and as
required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If
any Certificate shall not have been surrendered or Book-Entry Share not paid,
in each case, in accordance with _Section 2.3(b)(i)_, immediately prior to
the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share would

 



-10-  otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority,
any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of Parent free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(g)  _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_
that no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent from making
the payments required by this _Article II_, and following any losses Parent
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit
of the holders of Company Ordinary Shares in the amount of such losses.

 

(h) _Payment Procedures with Respect to Company Options, Company 102 Shares
and Company Restricted Stock Awards_.

 

(i) Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall transfer (A) the
aggregate Option Consideration with respect to the Company Options subject to
Section 102 of the Ordinance (the "Company 102 Options") and (B) the aggregate
Merger Consideration with respect to Company 102 Shares, to the 102 Trustee,
on behalf of holders of Company 102 Options and Company 102 Shares, as the
case may be, in accordance with Section 102 of the Ordinance and the Options
Tax Ruling, if obtained ((A) and (B) together, the "102 Amounts"). The 102
Amounts shall be held in trust by the 102 Trustee pursuant to the applicable
provisions of Section 102 of the Ordinance and the Options Tax Ruling, if
obtained, and shall be released by the 102 Trustee to the beneficial holders
of the Company 102 Options and Company 102 Shares, together with any interest
earned thereon by virtue of the investment of such amounts by the 102 Trustee,
in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 102 of the Ordinance
and the Options Tax Ruling, if obtained, the trustee agreement between the
Company and the 102 Trustee, and, in the case of 102 Amounts payable in
respect of Unvested Company Options, the terms and conditions of _Section
2.2(b)(i)_.

 

(ii) Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall (or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to) promptly deposit the aggregate Option Consideration with
respect to Vested Company Options (other than Company 102 Options) pursuant to
_Section 2.2_, and the aggregate Restricted Stock Consideration with respect
to Vested Company Restricted Stock Awards pursuant to  _Section 2.2_, with
the Surviving Company or, if applicable, its relevant engaging Subsidiary at
one or more accounts designated by the Company prior to Closing for the
benefit of the holders of Vested Company Options (other than Company 102
Options) and the holders of Vested Company Restricted Stock Awards,
respectively, which amounts shall be paid by the Surviving Company or, if
applicable, the relevant engaging Subsidiary, to the respective holders
thereof through the Surviving Companys or, if applicable, the relevant
engaging Subsidiarys payroll system, subject to applicable withholdings by
the Surviving Company or, if applicable, the relevant engaging Subsidiary, as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 



-11- Section 2.4 _Withholding Tax._

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereunder, each of Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Company, the 102 Trustee and the Exchange Agent (each,
a "Payor") shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement (including the Merger Consideration and
payments made pursuant to _Section 2.2_) to any Person such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Withholding Tax Ruling and the Options Tax Ruling, if
obtained, the Ordinance, the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law (it
being agreed that the Payor shall be permitted to satisfy any Tax withholding
requirement with respect to the Merger Consideration by deducting and
withholding the appropriate cash amount from the Cash Consideration). Any
amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made; provided that, with respect to the withholding of
Israeli Tax, in the event any holder of record of Company Ordinary Shares or
Company Options or a Company Restricted Stock Award provides the Payor with a
Valid Tax Certificate issued by the Israeli Tax Authority (the "ITA")
regarding the withholding (or exemption from withholding) of Israeli Tax from
the consideration payable in respect thereof in accordance with this _Article
II_, then the deduction and withholding of any amounts under the Ordinance or
any other provision of Israeli Law or requirement, if any, from the Merger
Consideration, the Option Consideration, or the Restricted Stock
Consideration, as applicable, payable to such holder of record of Company
Ordinary Shares, Company Options, or Company Restricted Stock Awards, as
applicable, shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of such
Valid Tax Certificate. To the extent amounts are so withheld, they shall be
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority prior to the last day on
which such payment is required, and then such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. To the extent any
Payor withholds any amounts, such Payor shall provide the affected Person, as
soon as practicable (but no later than within thirty (30) Business Days), with
sufficient evidence regarding such withholding.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.4(a)_, with respect to
Israeli Taxes, the consideration payable to each shareholder of the Company
shall be retained by the Exchange Agent for the benefit of each such
shareholder for a period of up to one hundred eighty (180) days from Closing
(the "Withholding Drop Date") (during which time no Payor shall make any
payments to any shareholder of the Company or withhold any amounts for Israeli
Taxes from the payments deliverable pursuant to this Agreement). If no later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Withholding Drop Date a Valid
Tax Certificate is delivered to Payor, then, with respect to the affected
shareholders, the deduction and withholding of any Israeli Taxes shall be made
only in accordance with the provisions of such Valid Tax Certificate and the
balance of the payment that is not withheld shall be paid to such
shareholders concurrently therewith subject to any non-Israeli withholding
which is applicable to the payment (if any). If any shareholder of the
Company (i) does not provide Payor with or is not the subject of a Valid Tax
Certificate, by no later than five (5) Business Days before the Withholding
Drop Date, or (ii) submits a written request with Payor to release its portion
of the consideration prior to the Withholding Drop Date and fails to submit a
Valid Tax Certificate at or before such time, then the amount to be withheld
from such shareholders portion of the consideration shall be calculated
according to the applicable withholding rate as reasonably determined by
Parent in

 



-12-  accordance with applicable Law (increased by interest plus linkage
differences, as defined in Section 159A of the Ordinance, for the period
between the fifteenth (15th) day of the calendar month following the month
during which the Closing occurs and the time the relevant payment is made, and
calculated in NIS based on a US$:NIS exchange rate not lower than the
effective exchange rate at the Closing Date) as reasonably determined
by Parent and the Exchange Agent.

Section 2.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Parent, and, if required by the Exchange Agent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the

Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment
became effective prior to the date of this Agreement, did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
amendments or modifications to Parent SEC Documents that were required to be
filed with (or furnished to) the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, but
that have not yet been filed with (or furnished to) the SEC. No Subsidiary of

structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item

to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable
Parent SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any
amendment thereto its conclusions about the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by such
report or amendment based on such evaluation. Parent has no "significant
deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as such terms are defined in Auditing
Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect
on the date of this Agreement) in the design or operation of internal control
over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect
Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial

each case regarding any accounting practices of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries and Parent has not received notice from any Governmental
Authority of any malfeasance by any director or executive officer of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries. Since December 31, 2015 through the date of this

Parent has not received from its independent auditors any written notification
of a material weakness in Parents internal controls and there have been no
material internal investigations regarding accounting, auditing or revenue
recognition discussed with, reviewed by or initiated at the direction of the
chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer or
general counsel of Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, the Parent Board or
any committee thereof.

 



-41- (i) Since December 31, 2015, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,
to the Knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, auditor or accountant of
Parent has received any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, in

Section 4.16 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent is a party to and has accepted a fully executed commitment letter
dated May 7, 2018 (together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, the
"Commitment Letter") from the lenders party thereto (collectively, the
"Lenders"), pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms
and conditions thereof, to provide debt financing in the amounts set forth
therein. The debt financing committed pursuant to the Commitment Letter is
collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "Bridge Financing."

 

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of
the executed Commitment Letter and any fee letters related thereto, subject,
in the case of such fee letters, to redaction solely of fee and other economic
provisions that could not in any event affect the conditionality,
enforceability, availability or amount of the Bridge Financing.

 



-44- (c) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter and the unredacted
portions of the fee letters referenced above, there are no conditions
precedent to the obligations of the Lenders to provide the Bridge Financing or
any contingencies that would permit the Lenders to reduce the total amount of
the Bridge Financing, including any condition or other contingency relating
to the amount or availability of the Bridge Financing pursuant to any "flex"
provision. As of the date hereof, Parent does not have any knowledge that any
of the Lenders will not perform its obligations thereunder. As of the date
hereof, there are no side letters, understandings or other agreements,
contracts or arrangements of any kind relating to the Commitment Letter to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party that could affect the
availability, conditionality, enforceability or amount of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter (except for the fee letters referenced
above).

 

(d) As of the date hereof, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ at the Closing, the net proceeds
contemplated from the Bridge Financing, when funded in accordance with the
Commitment Letter, together with cash on hand of Parent, will be sufficient
for the satisfaction of all of Parents and Merger Subs obligations under
this Agreement, including the payment of the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Company, any payments in respect of equity compensation
obligations to be made on the Closing Date in connection with the Merger, and
any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of the Company
and its Subsidiaries contemplated by, or required in connection with the
transactions described in, this Agreement or the Commitment Letter to be
repaid or refinanced at Closing (such amounts, collectively, the "Merger
Amounts").

 

(e) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligation and is in full force and effect with respect to Parent
and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors rights generally and
general principles of equity whether considered in a proceeding in equity or
at law. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which (with or without
notice, lapse of time or both) would or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition by Parent under the
terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter, and, assuming the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ at the
Closing, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Bridge Financing will not be satisfied by Parent on a timely
basis on or prior to the Closing Date or that the amount of the Bridge
Financing necessary for Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby will not be available to Parent on the date of the Closing. Parent has
paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid
pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter on or before the date of
this Agreement. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter has not been
modified, amended or altered and none of the respective commitments thereunder
has been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and, to the knowledge of
Parent, no withdrawal or rescission thereof is contemplated; _provided_ ,
that Parent is currently contemplating the refinancing of the Bridge Financing
provided pursuant to the Commitment Letter with permanent debt or equity
financing.

 

(f) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective Affiliates or any other financing be a condition to
any of Parents or Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement.

 



-45- Section 4.17 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this _Article IV_, none of
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes
any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or any other information provided to the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
accuracy, completeness or timeliness thereof. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties contained in
_Article III_, none of the Company or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives or any other Person makes (and Parent and Merger Sub are not
relying on) any representation or warranty, express or implied, to Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any other Person
on behalf of the Company will have or be subject to any liability or other
obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives or
Affiliates resulting from Parents, Merger Subs or their respective
Representatives or Affiliates use of any information, documents,
projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent, Merger Sub
or their respective Representatives or Affiliates, marketing material,
confidential information memorandum, management presentations, functional
"break-out" discussions, responses to questions submitted on behalf of Parent,
Merger Sub or their respective Representatives or Affiliates or in any other
form in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except to the extent any such information is expressly included in a
representation or warranty contained in _Article III_.

review and comment (which comments shall be considered by the applicable party
in good faith) thereon; _provided_ that, without limiting  _Section 5.10_,
with respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference
in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, this right to review and comment shall
apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or such
other partys business, financial condition or results of operations. If, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers,
should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that
either such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be prepared and, (other than regarding a Company Acquisition Proposal or
Company Adverse Recommendation Change) following a reasonable opportunity for
the other party (and its counsel) to review and comment on such amendment or
supplement, promptly filed with the SEC, the ISA, TASE and LSE, as applicable,
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
shareholders of the Company. Parent shall notify the Company promptly of the
time when the Form S-4 has become effective, or the issuance of any stop order
or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Each
party shall notify the other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the
SEC, ISA, TASE or LSE or the staff of the SEC, ISA, TASE or LSE and of any
request by the SEC, ISA, TASE or LSE or the staff of the SEC, ISA, TASE or LSE
for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, as
applicable, or for additional information and shall supply each other with
copies of all correspondence between either party or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, ISA, TASE or LSE or their
respective staff, as applicable, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger or the Company Shareholder Meeting.

 

(c) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.1_, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the effectiveness of

 



-52-  the Form S-4, set a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a special meeting of the Companys shareholders (together with
any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "Company Shareholders Meeting")
for the purpose of seeking the Company Shareholder Approval, and shall submit
such proposal to such holders at the Company Shareholders Meeting and shall
not submit any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Company
Shareholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, other than
(i) a customary proposal regarding adjournment of the Company Shareholders
Meeting and (ii) one or more proposals to the extent required or appropriate
to approve compensation arrangements for officers, employees or Affiliates of
the Company contemplated by this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure
Letter). For the avoidance of doubt, the proposals described in clause (ii) of
the preceding sentence shall be submitted for approval as separate items from
the Merger Proposal and shall in no event be deemed to be included within the
definition of "Company Shareholder Approval" or otherwise constitute a
condition to the effectiveness of the Merger or the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the
Company Shareholders Meeting without Parents prior written consent (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that without
Parents prior written consent, the Company may adjourn or postpone the
Company Shareholders Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the
extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement is provided to the shareholders of the Company within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Shareholders Meeting or
(ii) to a date that is in the aggregate not more than thirty (30) days
following the originally scheduled date (or the date rescheduled pursuant to
clause (i) hereof) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or
by proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Shareholders
Meeting or to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, to allow reasonable
additional time for solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining a quorum
or the Company Shareholder Approval. If the Company Board has not made a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 5.8_, the
Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company Recommendation,
include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and use its
reasonable best efforts to (I) solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor
of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger in accordance with Israeli
Law and (II) otherwise seek to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval at the
Company Shareholders Meeting. Notwithstanding any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Section 7.1_, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in
full force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1_, neither the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Company Superior Proposal) nor
the making of any Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall obviate or
otherwise affect the obligation of the Company to set a record date for, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Companys
shareholders in accordance with this _Section 5.3(c)_.

Section 5.4 _Merger Proposal; Certificate of Merger_.

 

(a) Subject to the ICL and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company and
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), as applicable, take
the following actions within the timeframes set forth in this _Section
5.4(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such actions or the time 

 



-53-  frame for taking such action shall be subject to any amendment in the
applicable provisions of the ICL and the regulations promulgated thereunder
(and in case of an amendment thereto, such amendment shall automatically
apply so as to amend this _Section 5.4(a)_ accordingly): (i) as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof, cause a merger proposal (in the Hebrew
language) in a form reasonably acceptable to the parties hereto (the "Merger
Proposal") to be executed in accordance with Section 316 of the ICL, (ii)
deliver the Merger Proposal to the Companies Registrar within three (3) days
from the calling of the Company Shareholders Meeting, (iii) cause a copy of
the Merger Proposal to be delivered to its secured creditors, if any, no later
than three (3) days after the date on which the Merger Proposal is delivered
to the Companies Registrar, (iv) (A) publish a notice to its creditors,
stating that a Merger Proposal was submitted to the Companies Registrar and
that the creditors may review the Merger Proposal at the office of the
Companies Registrar, the Companys registered office or Merger Subs
registered offices, as applicable, and at such other locations as the Company
or Merger Sub, as applicable, may determine, in (x) two (2) daily Hebrew
newspapers, on the day that the Merger Proposal is submitted to the Companies
Registrar and (y) in a popular newspaper outside of Israel as may be required
by applicable Law; (B) within four (4) business days from the date of
submitting the Merger Proposal to the Companies Registrar, send a notice by
registered mail to all of the "Substantial Creditors" (as such term is defined
in the regulations promulgated under the ICL) that the Company or Merger Sub,
as applicable, is aware of, in which it shall state that a Merger Proposal
was submitted to the Companies Registrar and that the creditors may review the
Merger Proposal at such additional locations, if such locations were
determined in the notice referred to in the immediately preceding clause
(A); and (C) send to the Companys "employees committee", if any, or display
in a prominent place at the Companys premises a copy of the notice published
in a daily Hebrew newspaper (as referred to in clause (A) of this  _Section
5.4(a)(iv)_), no later than three (3) business days following the day on which
the Merger Proposal was submitted to the Companies Registrar, (v) promptly
after the Company and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall have complied with the
preceding clauses (iii) and (iv) of this _Section 5.4(a)_, but in any event
no more than three (3) days following the date on which such notice was sent
to the creditors, inform the Companies Registrar, in accordance with Section
317(b) of the ICL, that notice was given to their respective creditors, if
any, under Section 318 of the ICL (and regulations promulgated thereunder),
(vi) not later than three (3) days after the date on which the Company
Shareholder Approval is received, inform (in accordance with Section 317(b) of
ICL and the regulations thereunder) the Companies Registrar of such approval,
and (vii) in accordance with the customary practice of the
Companies Registrar, request that the Companies Registrar declare the Merger
effective and issue the Certificate of Merger upon such date, that in no event
shall be prior to the lapse of 50 days from the filing of the Merger Proposal
with the Companies Registrar and 30 days from the date the Company
Shareholder Approval is received, as the Company and Merger Sub shall advise
the Companies Registrar. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, it is the intention of the
parties that the Merger shall be declared effective and the Certificate of
Merger shall be issued on the Closing Date. For purposes of this _Section
5.4(a)_, "business day" shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger
Regulations 5760-2000 promulgated under the ICL.

(b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the sole shareholder
of Merger Sub has approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. No later than three (3) days after the date
of such approval, Merger Sub shall (in accordance with Section 317(b) of the
ICL and the regulations thereunder) inform the Companies Registrar of such
approval.

 



-54- Section 5.5 _Stock Exchange Listings_.

 

(a) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, Parent shall take all
actions necessary in order to list the shares of Parent Common Stock on the
TASE immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing Date, the agreement of the TASE
to list such shares of Parent Common Stock and shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued in connection with the Merger on the TASE.

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, at or prior to
the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.6 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Without limiting the conditions to Merger set forth in _Article VI_, the
parties hereto will cooperate with each other and use (and will cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to cause the
conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied as
promptly as reasonably practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to
accomplish the following as promptly as reasonably practicable: (i) the
obtaining of all actions or nonactions, consents, approvals,
registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, orders, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods and other confirmations from any Governmental
Authority or other Person that are or may become necessary, proper or
advisable in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger; (ii) the preparation and
making of all registrations, filings, forms, notices, petitions, statements,
submissions of information, applications and other documents (including
filings with Governmental Authorities) that are or may become necessary,
proper or advisable in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger; (iii) the taking of all
steps as may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain an approval from, or
to avoid a Proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other Person in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger; (iv) the defending of any lawsuits or other
Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
that would otherwise prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, performed or
consummated by each party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
including seeking to have any stay, temporary restraining order or injunction
entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed; and
(v) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments that are or may
become reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and to
carry out fully the purposes of this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto
shall, in consultation and cooperation with the other parties and as promptly
as practicable but in no event later than as required by Law (and with respect
to notifications required under the HSR Act, in any event within ten (10)
Business Days of the date hereof), make its respective notices, filings and
applications under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Law with
respect to the

 



-55-  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor Parent
will withdraw any such notices, filings or applications without the prior
written consent of the other party. Parent shall pay all filing fees and
other charges for the filings required under any Antitrust Law by the Company
and Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), none of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries will make any material payment to any third party in
connection with seeking or obtaining its consent to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, if applicable, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall (i) promptly furnish to the other such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with the
preparation of any governmental filings, submissions or other documents; (ii)
give the other reasonable prior notice of any such filing, submission or other
document and, to the extent reasonably practicable, of any communication with
or from any Governmental Authority regarding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and permit the other to review (to the extent not prohibited
by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority) and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views, and secure the
participation, of the other in connection with any such filing, submission,
document or substantive communication; and (iii) cooperate in responding as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any investigation or other inquiry from
a Governmental Authority or in connection with any Proceeding initiated by a
Governmental Authority or private party, including informing the other party
as soon as practicable of any such investigation, inquiry or Proceeding, and
consulting in advance, to the extent practicable, before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, or, in connection
with any Proceeding initiated by a private party, to any other Person. In
addition, each of the parties hereto will give reasonable prior notice to and
consult with the other in advance of any meeting, conference or substantive
communication with any Governmental Authority, or, in connection with any
Proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent
not prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority,
not participate or attend any meeting or conference, or engage in any
communication, with any Governmental Authority or such other Person in respect
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without offering the other
party the possibility to participate, attend or engage in such meetings,
conferences or communications, and in the event one party is prohibited from,
or unable to participate, attend or engage in, any such meeting, conference
or substantive communication, keep such party apprised with respect thereto.
To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Authority, each party shall furnish to the other copies of all
filings, submissions, correspondence and communications between it and its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or members of any Governmental Authoritys staff (or
any other Person in connection with any Proceeding initiated by a private
party), on the other hand, with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each party may, as it deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate material provided to the other party as "Outside Counsel
Only Material," and also may reasonably redact the material as necessary to
(A) remove personally sensitive information, (B) remove references concerning
the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and its
Subsidiaries conducted in connection with the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the negotiations and investigations leading thereto, (C) comply
with contractual arrangements, (D) prevent the loss of a legal privilege or
(E) comply with applicable Law.

 



-56- (c) The parties shall jointly develop the strategy relating to the Antitrust
Laws and consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith
the views of one another, regarding the form and content of any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either party in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law prior to their
submission; _provided_ , that, without limiting Parents obligations under
this _Section 5.6_, Parent shall ultimately control the strategy relating to
the Antitrust Laws and shall have final decision-making authority with respect
to such strategy to the extent required to insure that Parent can meet its
obligations in this _Section 5.6_ and its ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable and in
any event prior to the Termination Date ( _provided_ , that Parent shall have
consulted with the Company with respect to such strategy and decision and
considered the Companys views in good faith).

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, take any and all actions necessary to
obtain each Consent required under or in connection with any applicable
Antitrust Law, and to enable all waiting periods under any applicable
Antitrust Law to expire or terminate, and to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any applicable Antitrust Law that may be asserted by
any Governmental Authority so as to enable the consummation of the Merger as
promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the Termination
Date, including at Parents sole cost (i) comply with all restrictions and
conditions, if any, imposed or requested by any Governmental Authority with
respect to Antitrust Laws in connection with granting any necessary clearance
or terminating any applicable waiting period, including (A) agreeing to sell,
divest, hold separate, license, cause a third party to acquire, or dispose of,
otherwise encumber or impair or take any other action with respect to any
Subsidiary, operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, customers,
assets or properties of Parent, its Affiliates, the Company or its
Subsidiaries contemporaneously with or after the Closing and regardless as to
whether a third party has been identified or approved prior to the Closing,
(B) taking or committing to take such other actions that may limit or
otherwise affect Parents, its Subsidiaries, the Companys or its
Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
one or more of its operations, divisions, businesses, product lines,
customers, assets or properties and (C) entering into any Order, consent
decree or other agreement to effectuate any of the foregoing and (ii) oppose
fully and vigorously any request for, the entry of, and seek to have vacated
or terminated, any Order of any Governmental Authority with respect to
Antitrust Laws that could restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including by
defending through litigation (including by retaining all appropriate expert
witnesses and consultants) any action asserted by any Person in any court or
before any Governmental Authority with respect to Antitrust Laws and by
exhausting all avenues of appeal, including appealing properly any adverse
decision or Order by any Governmental Authority with respect to Antitrust
Laws. The Company shall be permitted to participate in all aspects of the
defense of such proceedings and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to prevail in such proceedings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall
not be required to take, or agree to take, any of the actions contemplated by
this _Section 5.6(d)_ with respect to Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries if any such actions would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material and adverse to Parent,
the

 



-57-  Surviving Company and their respective Subsidiaries (but measured on a scale
relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), it being
understood that the Company shall neither agree nor permit any of its
Subsidiaries to agree without the prior written consent of Parent to take any
such actions (provided that, if the Parent so directs, the Company shall
agree, so long as such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing).
Nothing in this _Section 5.6(d)_ shall require either Parent or the Company
to effectuate or agree to effectuate any of the transactions or restrictions
contemplated by this _Section 5.6(d)_ unless such transactions
or restrictions are conditioned upon the Closing.

(e) Without limiting _Section 5.6(d)_, each of the parties agrees that,
between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1_, it shall
not, and shall ensure that none of its Subsidiaries shall, consummate, enter
into any agreement providing for, or announce, any investment, acquisition,
divestiture or other business combination that would reasonably be expected to
materially impede, materially delay or prevent or adversely affect (i) the
obtaining of any Consent of any Governmental Authority or expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall (and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford reasonable access to Parents
Representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice,
throughout the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time
(or until the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.1_), to the personnel, advisors, properties, books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and, during such period, shall (and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish reasonably promptly to such
Representatives all information concerning the business, properties and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case as may reasonably
be requested by Parent to prepare for the Closing; _provided_ that nothing
herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any
information to Parent or Merger Sub if such disclosure would, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, (a) violate applicable Law or the
provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or (b) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in each such case, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent to enable Parent and
Parents Representatives to enter into appropriate confidentiality, joint
defense or similar documents or arrangements so that Parent and Parents
Representatives may have access to such information. No investigation or
access permitted pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company
hereunder. All information furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries and the
Companys officers, employees and other Representatives pursuant to this
_Section 5.7_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 5.8 _No Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Section 7.1_,
except as provided in this _Section 5.8_, (i) the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers and directors to,
immediately cease, and shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts

 



-58-  to cause its and their respective other Representatives to immediately
cease, all existing discussions, negotiations and communications with any
Persons with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) the Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
officers and directors not to, and shall instruct and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
(A) initiate, seek, solicit, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing any nonpublic information) the making or
submission of a Company Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into or engage in
any negotiations or discussions with, or provide any nonpublic information
to, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Person (other than Parent or
any of its Representatives) relating to or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating any Company Acquisition Proposal (other than to state that the
terms of this Agreement prohibit such discussions) or (C) grant any waiver or
release under any standstill or similar agreement (except that if the Company
Board determines in good faith that the failure to grant any waiver or release
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Israeli Law, the Company
may waive any such standstill provision in order to permit a third party to
make and pursue a Company Acquisition Proposal), (iii) the Company shall not
provide any third party and shall, within two (2) Business Days of the date of
this Agreement, terminate access of any third party who has made or indicated
an interest in making a Company Acquisition Proposal to any data room (virtual
or actual) containing any nonpublic information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (iv) within two (2) Business Days of the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall demand the return or destruction of all
confidential, non-public information and materials that have been provided to
third parties that have entered into confidentiality agreements relating to a
possible Company Acquisition Proposal with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.8(a)_, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval (and in no event after receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval), if the Company receives a bona fide Company Acquisition
Proposal from a third party made after the date of this Agreement that did
not result from a material breach of _Section 5.8(a)_, then the Company may
(i) contact the Person or any of its Representatives who has made such Company
Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms of such Company Acquisition
Proposal so that the Company Board (or any committee thereof) may inform
itself about such Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) afford access to or
furnish information concerning itself and its business, properties or assets
or provide access to a data room (virtual or actual) to such Person or any of
its Representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (which the Company
and its Representatives shall be permitted to negotiate) with confidentiality
terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the Company
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (iii) negotiate and
participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person or any of its
Representatives concerning such Company Acquisition Proposal, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to
constitute or result in a Company Superior Proposal. The Company shall (A)
promptly (and in any case within forty-eight (48) hours) provide Parent notice
(1) of the receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any
Company Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include a complete,
unredacted copy of all written proposals, draft agreements relating to, and/or
other written materials that describe any such Company Acquisition Proposal,
and (2) of any inquiries,

 



-59-  proposals or offers by third parties received by, any requests by third
parties for nonpublic information from, or any discussions or negotiations
initiated or continued (or sought to be initiated or continued) by third
parties with, the Company or any of its Representatives concerning a Company
Acquisition Proposal, and disclose the material terms of such offer, proposal
or request, (B) make available to Parent, substantially concurrently with the
time it is provided or made available to such party, all material nonpublic
information, including copies of all material written materials, made
available by the Company to such party but not previously made available
to Parent and (C) keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis of the
status and material events (including amendments and proposed amendments to
any material terms) regarding any such Company Acquisition Proposal or other
inquiry, offer, proposal or request, providing to Parent unredacted copies of
any additional or revised written proposals or draft agreements relating to
such Company Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or
request. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into
any agreement with any Person that prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with this _Section 5.8_.

 

(c) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.8_, the Company Board shall not
(i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or
modify, the Company Recommendation, in each case in a manner adverse to Parent
or Merger Sub, (ii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, (iii) publicly recommend or declare advisable any Company
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) adopt, authorize or approve any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other
similar agreement providing for any Company Acquisition Proposal (other than
a confidentiality agreement permitted by _Section 5.8(b)_) (any action
described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) of this sentence being
referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change").

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at
any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval (and in no
event after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval), the Company Board
receives a Company Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material
breach of  _Section 5.8(a)_ and that the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, the Company Board may (i)
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ in order to enter
into a definitive agreement providing for such Company Superior Proposal if,
in each case, (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Israeli Law, (B)
the Company has notified Parent in writing at least four (4) Business Days
before taking such action that it intends to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.8(d)_ or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, (C) the Companys notice
delivered pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) attaches the proposed
definitive agreement or the most current version of any proposed agreement
between the Company and the Person making such Company Superior Proposal, if
any, or a reasonably detailed summary of all material terms of such Company
Superior Proposal and the identity of the offeror, if no such agreement
exists, (D) for a period of four (4) Business Days following the notice
delivered pursuant to clause (B) of this _Section 5.8(d)_, the Company and
the Companys relevant Representatives shall have discussed

 



-60-  and negotiated in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate)
with Parent and Parents relevant Representatives any proposed modifications
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in response to such Company
Superior Proposal, and (E) no earlier than the end of such four-(4)-Business
Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
and after taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend or modify the
terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered by Parent in writing, that the
Company Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the notice described
in clause (B) above still constitutes a Company Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that in the event of any amendment to the financial
terms or other material terms of any such Company Superior Proposal, a new
written notification from the Company consistent with that described clause
(B) of this _Section 5.8(d)_ shall be required and a new notice period under
clause (B) of this _Section 5.8(d)_ shall commence, during which notice
period the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this
_Section 5.8(d)_ anew, except that such new notice period shall be for two
(2) Business Days (as opposed to four (4) Business Days)).

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, other than in
connection with a Company Superior Proposal (which shall be subject to
_Section 5.8(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section 5.8(e)_), prior
to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (and in no event after receipt
of the Company Shareholder Approval), the Company Board may, in response to
or as a result of a Company Intervening Event, take any action prohibited by
clauses (i) or (ii) of _Section 5.8(c)_, if (i) the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Israeli Law, (ii) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it
intends to effect such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant
to this _Section 5.8(e)_ (which notice shall specify the facts and
circumstances providing the basis of the Company Intervening Event in
reasonable detail), (iii) for a period of four (4) Business Days following the
notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this _Section 5.8(e)_, the
Company and the Companys relevant Representatives shall have discussed and
negotiated in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with
Parent and Parents relevant Representatives any proposed modifications to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iv) no earlier than the end
of such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, and after
taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend or modify the terms of
this Agreement irrevocably offered by Parent in writing, that the failure to
take such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Israeli Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) disclosing to its shareholders a position or opinion
contemplated by Section 329 of the ICL or issuing a "stop, look and listen" or
similar statement to its shareholders, or (ii) making any disclosure to its
shareholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company
Board to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Israeli Law or would reasonably likely conflict with or violate any
applicable Law or the rules or requirements of the TASE or the LSE; _provided_
, _however_ , that (A) in no event shall this _Section 5.8(f)_ affect or
modify the definition of Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (B) any
such disclosure (other than issuance by the Company of a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or by

 



-61-  the ICL) that addresses or relates to the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Company Board with respect to this
Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board in connection with such
communication publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this
Agreement has not changed.

 

(g) References in this _Section 5.8_ to the Company Board shall include any
committee thereof.

 

Section 5.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
the current or former directors, officers or employees (in the case of
employees, only such persons who are covered by the Companys existing
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance as of the date hereof) of the Company (the "DandO
Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Articles of Association or any
indemnification Contract between such Person and the Company (in each case,
as in effect on, and, in the case of any indemnification Contracts, to the
extent made available to Parent prior to, the date of this Agreement) shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period
of seven (7) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain in effect the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses equivalent to the
provisions of the Articles of Association as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Parties; _provided_ that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claim made for indemnification within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such action or final
resolution of such claim.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 5.9_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, without the prior express written consent of
the applicable DandO Indemnified Party, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and any of its Subsidiaries)
shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry for which indemnification is sought by a DandO
Indemnified Party under or as contemplated by this Agreement unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination does not include any admission
of wrongdoing by such DandO Indemnified Party and includes an unconditional
release of such DandO Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company as of or after the
Effective Time to, purchase a seven (7)-year prepaid "tail" policy, with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance, with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time
(including in connection with this

 



-62-  Agreement and the transactions or actions contemplated by this Agreement),
and the Surviving Company and Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained
in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations
thereunder to be honored; provided that such "tail" policy shall be consistent
in all material respects with the terms set forth in the Companys
compensation policy adopted (whether before or after the date of this
Agreement) in accordance with the ICL; provided further that the Company shall
not pay, and the Surviving Company shall not be required to pay, to secure
such "tail" policy in excess of seven hundred percent (700%) of the
last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement
in respect of such existing policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance, but in such case shall purchase
as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. If the Company or
the Surviving Company for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies prior to, as of or after the Effective Time, Parent shall, for a
period of seven (7) years from the Effective Time, cause the Surviving
Company to maintain in effect the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time;
provided that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay
annual premiums in excess of three hundred and fifty percent (350%) of the
last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement
in respect of such coverage, but in such case shall continue to be maintained
as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.

 

(d) The covenants contained in this _Section 5.9_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which any such Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract
or otherwise.

 

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or assigns
or transferees of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 

Section 5.10 _Public Disclosure_. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
neither Parent, nor the Company, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries,
will disseminate any press release or other public announcement or disclosure
concerning this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except as may be required by Law or the rules of
a recognized securities exchange, including the NYSE, the TASE and the LSE,
without the prior consent of each of the other parties hereto, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The parties have
agreed to the text of the joint press release announcing the execution of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) without prior consent of
the other parties, each party may disseminate information substantially
consistent with information included in a press release or other document
previously approved for external distribution by the other parties and (b)
this _Section 5.10_ shall not apply to any press release or other public
announcement or disclosure by the Company of any information concerning any
Company Acquisition Proposal or this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in connection with or following a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



-63- Section 5.11 _Employee Benefits; Labor_.

 

(a) For purposes of this _Section 5.11_, the term "Continuation Period" shall
mean the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time.

(b) Except where applicable Law or the provisions of a Labor Agreement
require more favorable treatment, during the Continuation Period, Parent
shall, or shall cause a Subsidiary of Parent to, provide to each Covered
Employee for so long as such Covered Employee remains employed by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries during the Continuation Period, (i) a base salary or
wage rate at least equal to the base salary or wage rate of such Covered
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) annual or other short-
term cash incentive compensation opportunities at least equal to the annual
or other short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities of such Covered
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) equity or equity-based
incentive compensation opportunities at least equal to the equity or equity-
based incentive compensation opportunities of such Covered Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) employee benefits (excluding
equity and equity-based compensation, retention benefits and change in
control benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to such Covered
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) In the event any Covered Employee first becomes eligible to participate
under any employee benefit plan or compensation plan maintained by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (a "Parent Benefit Plan") following the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause a Subsidiary of Parent to use commercially
reasonable efforts to, (i) waive any preexisting condition exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to any Covered Employee under any Parent Benefit Plan providing
medical, dental or vision benefits to the same extent such limitation would
have been waived or satisfied under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which
the Covered Employee participated immediately prior to coverage under the
Parent Benefit Plan; and (ii) provide each Covered Employee with credit for
any co-payments, out-of-pocket requirements and deductibles paid prior to the
Covered Employees coverage under any Parent Benefit Plan during the plan
year in which such Covered Employee first becomes eligible to participate
under such Parent Benefit Plan, to the same extent such credit was given under
any similar Company Benefit Plan that Covered Employee participated
in immediately prior to coverage under the Parent Benefit Plan, in satisfying
any applicable co-payment, deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the
Parent Benefit Plan for the plan year in which such Covered Employee first
becomes eligible to participate under such Parent Benefit Plan.

 

(d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall recognize, or shall cause a
Subsidiary of Parent to recognize, all service of each Covered Employee prior
to the Effective Time to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor entities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) for purposes
of vesting, eligibility and, solely in respect of vacation and severance
entitlements, benefit accrual under any Parent Benefit Plan established or
maintained for the benefit of Covered Employees, in each case, to the same
extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time
under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective

 



-64-  Time; _provided_ , that, (i) for the avoidance of doubt, such service shall
not be recognized with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan that provides
defined benefit pension benefits or retiree welfare benefits and (ii) such
recognition of service shall not apply for purposes of any Parent Benefit Plan
under which similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries do not
receive credit for prior service or that is grandfathered or frozen, either
with respect to level of benefits or participation. In no event shall anything
contained in this _Section 5.11_ result in any duplication of benefits for
the same period of service.

 

(e) If the Closing occurs prior to the payment of annual bonuses for 2018:

 

(i) to the extent that a Covered Employee (other than any Covered Employee who
is employed at the Companys headquarters or is an "office holder" of the
Company (as such term is defined in the ICL)) who participates as of
immediately prior to the Closing in a Company Benefit Plan that is an annual
bonus plan (a "Company Bonus Plan") remains employed through December 31,
2018, Parent shall cause the Company to pay such Covered Employee an annual
bonus for such year based on the actual level of achievement of the applicable
performance goals in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable annual bonus plan at the time that annual bonuses are payable in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice;

 

(ii) to the extent that a Covered Employee who is employed at the Companys
headquarters or is an "office holder" of the Company (as such term is defined
in the ICL) remains employed through December 31, 2018, Parent shall cause the
Company to pay such Covered Employee an annual bonus for such year as
described in Section 5.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter; and

(iii) if an applicable Covered Employees employment with the Company and
its Subsidiaries is terminated by the Company and its Subsidiaries without
cause on or after the Closing and prior to December 31, 2018, such Covered
Employee shall receive a prorated bonus payment (A) if such Covered Employee
is not employed at the Companys headquarters and is not an "office holder"
of the Company (as defined in the ICL), within thirty (30) days following the
date on which bonuses are paid to active employees under the Company Bonus
Plan equal to the product of (x) the full annual bonus for the year of
termination based on the actual level of achievement of the applicable
performance goals, _multiplied_ by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days between January 1, 2018 and the date of such termination
of employment and the denominator of which is the total number of days in
calendar year 2018 (the "Proration Fraction"), or (B) if such Covered Employee
is employed at the Companys headquarters or is an "office holder" of the
Company (as defined in the ICL), within thirty (30) days following the date on
which bonuses are paid to active employees under the Company Bonus Plan equal
to the product of (x) the full annual bonus for the year of termination to
which such Covered Employee would have been entitled under Section
5.11(e)(ii), _multiplied by_ (y) the Proration Fraction.

 

(f) The Company and Parent agree to take the actions set forth on _Section
5.11(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



-65- (g) If requested by Parent in a writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company and Company
Subsidiaries shall, or shall cause their boards of directors (or the
appropriate committees thereof), to adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is necessary to terminate each 401(k) plan of the Company and
Company Subsidiaries specified by Parent, effective as of immediately prior to
the Closing. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
the review and approval of Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event that Parent requests that any
Company 401(k) plan be terminated, (i) prior to the Closing Date and
thereafter (as applicable), Parent shall take any and all action as may
be required, including amendments to each applicable 401(k) plan sponsored or
maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, to permit each applicable
Covered Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code,
including of loans) in cash or notes (in the case of loans) in an amount equal
to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account balance
distributable to such Covered Employee from the applicable Company 401(k)
plan to the corresponding Parent 401(k) plan, and (ii) the Covered Employees
who were eligible to participate in any Company 401(k) plan as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be eligible to participate, effective as of
the Effective Time, in the applicable Parent 401(k) plan.

(h) Prior to making any broad-based or other formal written communications to
current or former employees of the Company or Company Subsidiaries pertaining
to compensation or benefits matters set forth in this _Section 5.11_, the
Company shall, or shall cause the relevant Company Subsidiary to, provide
Parent with a copy of the intended communication and Parent shall have a
reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication.

 

(i) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 5.11_ with respect to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any other Person, including
employees, former employees, any participant or any beneficiary thereof,
under this Agreement or in any Company Benefit Plan or (ii) to continued
employment with the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates. Nothing set forth in this _Section 5.11_ shall constitute an
amendment or modification to, or adoption of, any Company Benefit Plan or any
other plan, program, agreement or arrangement of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates or any other
arrangement covering employees of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries,
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates.

Section 5.12 _Merger Sub_. Parent will take all actions necessary to (a)
cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
and (b) ensure that Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time shall not conduct
any business, incur or guarantee any Indebtedness or any other liabilities or
make any investments, other than those activities incident to its obligations
under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.13 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause any
acquisitions of shares of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities
with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting

 



-66-  from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
will become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to Parent, if any, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 5.14 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, advisable or proper to obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter (or (subject to the
provisions of Section 5.14 _(c)_ ), the proceeds of permanent Financing in
lieu thereof) (taking into account any "flex provisions" set forth in the
related fee letters) on or prior to the date upon which the Merger is required
to be consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including by using
reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter
(provided, that the Commitment Letter may be amended, supplemented, modified
and replaced as permitted by _Sections 5.14(b)_ and _(c)_ ), (ii) negotiate
and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing (the
"Definitive Agreements") consistent with the terms and conditions contained in
the Commitment Letter (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions
contained in any related fee letter) and (iii) satisfy (or, if deemed
advisable by Parent, obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing) in the Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements and comply
with its obligations thereunder. In the event that all conditions contained in
the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements (other than the
consummation of the Merger and those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders or other applicable Financing
Sources to comply with their respective obligations thereunder, including to
fund the Financing, and to enforce its rights, under the Commitment Letter
and Definitive Agreements.

(b) Parent shall not without the prior written consent of the Company permit
any amendment or modification to, replacement of, or any waiver of any
material provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter if such amendment,
modification, replacement, waiver or remedy (A) adds new (or adversely
modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of
the Financing (other than the addition of conditions to the consummation of
any replacement financing that relate to purely ministerial matters,
which conditions would not reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay
the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby),
(B) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing to less than the amount of
the Bridge Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof, (C) adversely affects the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against other parties to the Commitment Letter, the Financing or the
Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise
modified, relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof in any
material respect, or (D) could otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent,
impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that no consent from
the Company shall be required for (x) any amendment, replacement, supplement
or modification of the Commitment Letter that adds lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the

 



-67-  Commitment Letter as of the date hereof (including in replacement of a
Lender), (y) implementation or exercise of any "flex" provisions provided in
any related fee letter as in effect as of the date hereof or (z) any
amendment to, or replacement of or supplement or modification to, the
Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreement so long as such action would not be
prohibited by the foregoing clauses (A) through (D). Parent shall promptly
notify the Company of any such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement
and, upon request, deliver the Company a copy thereof.

 

(c) Parent shall have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated
equity or equity-linked offerings or debt offerings or other incurrences of
debt (including unsecured notes) the proceeds of which are to be used to fund
the Merger Amounts for all or any portion of the Bridge Financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter by reducing commitments under the Commitment
Letter;  _provided_ , that to the extent any such debt has a scheduled
special or mandatory redemption right, such right is not exercisable prior to
the earliest of the consummation of the Merger on the Closing Date, the
termination of this Agreement and the Termination Date (if the Closing Date
had not occurred on such date). In the event that any portion of the Bridge
Financing becomes unavailable and such portion is necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent will (i) use reasonable
best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing in an amount sufficient,
when taken together with Parents available cash on hand (including the
proceeds of any permanent Financing) and any then-available portion of the
Bridge Financing, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and the
other Merger Amounts from the same or other sources and (ii) promptly notify
the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor. For the purposes
of this Agreement, the term "Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any
commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any substitute or
alternative financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Commitment
Letter remaining in effect at the time in question). Parent shall provide the
Company with prompt written notice of any actual or threatened material breach
or default or termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment
Letter or any Definitive Agreement of which Parent becomes aware and the
receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Lender
or other financing source with respect to any breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement
of any provision thereof; _provided_ , that neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall be under any obligation to disclose any information that
is subject to attorney client or similar privilege to the extent such
privilege is asserted in good faith or otherwise would violate or contravene
any Law or any obligation of confidentiality (it being agreed that Parent
shall give notice to Company of the fact that it is withholding such
information pursuant to this proviso, and thereafter the Company and Parent
shall reasonably cooperate to cause such information to be provided, to the
extent reasonably possible, in a manner that would not reasonably be expected
to violate the applicable restriction). Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts
to consummate the Financing.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to provide, all customary cooperation as is
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or any of its

 



-68-  Subsidiaries), including by (i) making senior management and advisors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries available to participate in a reasonable number
of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions
with rating agencies, at reasonable times and with reasonable advance notice,
(ii) reasonably assisting Parent with Parents preparation of materials for
rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda, offering memoranda,
private placement memoranda, prospectus and similar documents used in
connection with the Financing, and providing customary authorization letters
in connection therewith, (iii) assisting with due diligence activities
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, including financial and other
information related thereto, at mutually agreeable times upon reasonable
advance notice, (iv) furnishing Parent and the Lenders (A) IFRS audited
consolidated statements of financial position, income statements and
statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in shareholders
equity, and statements of cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
each of the three most recently completed fiscal years ending at least ninety
(90) days prior to the Closing Date, (B) IFRS unaudited consolidated
statements of financial position, income statements and statements of
comprehensive income, statements of changes in shareholders equity, and
statements of cash flows for each subsequent fiscal quarter of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries ending after the date of the most recently ended
fiscal year for which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to
the foregoing clause (A) and at least sixty (60) days prior to the Closing
Date (but, excluding the fourth quarter of any fiscal year), (C) as promptly
as reasonably practicable, historical financial information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably requested by Parent to permit Parent
to prepare the pro forma financial statements referred to in paragraph 2(z) of
Annex C of the Commitment Letter (as in effect on the date hereof); and (D)
promptly, such other financial and other information regarding the Company as
may be reasonably requested by Parent as is customarily required in connection
with the execution of financings of a type similar to the Financing
(the information described in clauses (A), (B) and (C) of this clause (iv),
the "Required Information" , which Required Information shall be delivered in
Compliant form), (vi) furnishing written notice to Parent if the Company
shall have knowledge that the Required Information is no longer Compliant and
supplementing the Required Information to the extent that any such Required
Information is no longer Compliant and (v) requesting that its independent
accountants provide, and using commercially reasonable efforts to cause them
to provide, customary comfort letters (including "negative assurance"
comfort), customary agreed procedures letters (if required) and consents for
use of their reports, on customary terms and consistent with customary
practice in connection with any Financing. The foregoing notwithstanding,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or
permit the taking of any action pursuant to this  _Section 5.14_ that would:
(A) require the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors,
officers or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries to pass resolutions
or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Financing or execute
or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or agreement (other than
customary authorization letters), (B) cause any representation or warranty in
this Agreement to be breached by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C)
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other
similar fee or incur any other expense (other than any expense that is
simultaneously reimbursed by Parent), liability or obligation in
connection with the Financing prior to the Closing or have any obligation
under any agreement, certificate, document or instrument be effective until
the Closing, (D) cause any director, officer, employee or stockholder of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (E) (x)
reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or a default
(with or without

 



-69-  notice, lapse of time, or both) under, any material contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or the organizational documents
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any Laws or (y) provide access to or
require the disclosure of any information that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries determines would jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case it being
agreed that the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is
withholding such information or documents pursuant to this clause (E), and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to cause
such information to be provided, to the extent reasonably possible, in a
manner that would not reasonably be expected to violate the applicable
restriction) or (F) require the preparation of any financial statements or
information that are not reasonably available to it or prepared in the
ordinary course of its financial reporting practice. Nothing contained in this
Section 5.14 or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with
respect to the Financing. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives in connection with such cooperation and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, any action taken by
them pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ and any information used in connection
therewith (other than information provided in writing by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with its obligations pursuant to this _Section
5.14_), in each case, other than to the extent any of the foregoing arises
from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Company, its
Subsidiaries and/or their respective Representatives.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this
_Section 5.14_ represent the sole obligation of the Company, its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives with respect to cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of any financing (including the Financing) to
be obtained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no other provision of this
Agreement shall be deemed to expand such obligations and (ii) unless any such
breach is the primary cause for the failure of the proceeds of the Financing
necessary to consummate the Merger to be made available to Parent (it being
understood that if the Company breaches in any material respect its
obligations to deliver (or to cause its Subsidiaries or Representatives to
deliver) the Required Information and for such Required Information to be
Compliant and the proceeds of the Financing necessary to consummate the
Merger are not made available to Parent as a result thereof, such breach by
the Company of such obligations shall be deemed the "primary cause" of such
failure), the breach by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives of their obligations set forth in this _Section
5.14_ shall not be taken into account with respect to whether any condition to
the Closing set forth in this Agreement shall have been satisfied. In
no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective Subsidiaries be a condition to any of Parents or
Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement.

(f) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and the Company
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing, _provided_ that such
logos shall be used solely in a customary manner that is not intended or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the

 



-70-  Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Company consents to Parent sharing the Companys information with its
potential Financing Sources and their Representatives subject to entering into
customary confidentiality agreements with such potential Financing Sources and
their Representatives.

 

(g) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all
notices, reasonably cooperate with Parent and take all other
actions reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the termination at the
Closing of all commitments in respect of the Credit Agreements, the repayment
in full on the Closing Date (or in the case of any letters of credit, cash
collateralization, to the extent that Parent shall not have entered into an
alternative arrangement with the applicable issuing bank) of all obligations
in respect of the indebtedness under the Credit Agreements, and the release on
the Closing Date of any Liens securing all such indebtedness and guarantees
in connection therewith. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts
and shall reasonably cooperate with Parent to obtain and deliver to Parent at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date executed payoff
letters with respect to each such Credit Agreement (the "Payoff Letters"), in
form and substance customary for financings of the type (and in
the jurisdictions) to which such Payoff Letters relate, from the applicable
agent on behalf of the Persons to whom such indebtedness is owed, which Payoff
Letters together with any related release documentation shall, among other
things and to the extent customary for financings of the type (and in the
jurisdiction) to which such Payoff Letters relate, include the payoff amount
and provide that Liens (and guarantees), if any, granted in connection with
the applicable Credit Agreement relating to the assets, rights and properties
of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing such indebtedness shall, upon the
payment of the amount set forth in the applicable Payoff Letter at or prior to
the Closing, be released and terminated. The obligations of the Company
pursuant to this _Section 5.14(g)_ shall be subject to Parent providing all
funds required to effect all such repayments and cash collateralization of (or
alternative arrangement with respect to) letters of credit at or prior to the
Closing.

Section 5.15 _Tax Rulings_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and/or accountants to
prepare and file with the ITA an application for a ruling (which shall be
confirmed by Parent prior to its submission, such confirmation not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) confirming that
the cancellation and exchange of the Company 102 Options in accordance with
_Section 2.2_ and conversion of the Company 102 Shares in accordance with
_Section 2.1(a)_ shall not be regarded as a violation of the
"requisite holding period" (as such term is defined in Section 102 of the
Ordinance) so long as the respective Option Consideration and the Merger
Consideration are deposited with the 102 Trustee until the end of the
respective holding period (which ruling may be subject to customary
conditions regularly associated with such a ruling) (the "Options Tax
Ruling"). The Company shall include in the request for the Options Tax Ruling
a request to exempt Parent, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent and
their respective agents from any withholding obligation in relation to any
payments made with respect to any Company 102 Options or Company 102 Shares.
The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Options Tax
Ruling prior to the Closing. If the Options Tax Ruling is not granted prior to
the

 



-71-  Closing or in accordance with the instructions of the ITA, the Company shall
seek to obtain prior to the Closing an interim tax ruling confirming, among
other things, that Parent and any Person acting on its behalf (including the
Exchange Agent) shall be exempt from Israeli withholding tax in relation to
any payments made with respect to any Company 102 Options or Company 102
Shares to the Exchange Agent, the 102 Trustee or the Company in connection
with the Merger (the "Interim Option Tax Ruling"). To the extent that prior to
the Closing an Interim Option Tax Ruling shall have been obtained, then all
references herein to the Options Tax Ruling shall be deemed to refer to such
Interim Option Tax Ruling, until such time that a final definitive Options Tax
Ruling is obtained. The final text of the Israeli Options Tax Ruling and the
Interim Option Tax Ruling, including appendices thereof, shall in
all circumstances be subject to the prior review and comment (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) by Parent and its counsel
and tax advisors.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to
prepare and file with the ITA an application for a ruling that (i) with
respect to holders of Company Ordinary Shares, Company Options (other than
Company 102 Options), Company Restricted Stock Awards that are non- Israeli
residents (as defined in the Ordinance or as will be determined by the ITA),
(A) exempts Parent, the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company and their
respective agents from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement,
including the Merger Consideration, or clarifies that no such obligation
exists, or (B) instructs Parent, the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company
and their respective agents on how such withholding is to be executed, and in
particular, with respect to the classes or categories of holders of the
Company Ordinary Shares, Company Options (other than Company 102 Options),
Company Restricted Stock Awards from which Tax is to be withheld (if any),
the rate or rates of withholding to be applied and how to identify any such
non-Israeli residents; and (ii) with respect to holders of Company Ordinary
Shares (other than Company 102 Shares), Company Options (other than Company
102 Options), Company Restricted Stock Awards that are Israeli residents (as
defined in the Ordinance or as will be determined by the ITA) (A)
exempts Parent, the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company and their
respective agents from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement,
including the Merger Consideration, or clarifies that no such obligation
exists, or (B) instructs Parent, the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company and
their respective agents on how such withholding is to be executed, and in
particular, with respect to the classes or categories of holders of the
Company Ordinary Shares, Company Options (other than Company 102 Options),
Company Restricted Stock Awards from which Tax is to be withheld (if any), the
rate or rates of withholding to be applied (the "Withholding Tax Ruling").

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.15(a)_ and _Section
5.15(b)_, each of the Company and Parent shall cause their respective Israeli
counsel, advisors and accountants to coordinate all material activities, and
to cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation and filing of
such application and in the preparation of any written or oral submissions
that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Options Tax Ruling
(including the Interim Option Tax Ruling) and the Withholding Tax Ruling. The
final text of the Interim Option Tax Ruling, the Options Tax Ruling and the
Withholding Tax Ruling shall be subject to the prior written confirmation of
Parent or its counsel, which consent shall not be

 



-72-  unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to obtain the
Interim Option Tax Ruling, the Options Tax Ruling and the Withholding Tax
Ruling, as promptly as practicable. In the event that the Interim Option Tax
Ruling, the Options Tax Ruling or the Withholding Tax Ruling has not been
received in accordance with the terms of this _Section 5.15_, Parent may make
such payments and withhold any applicable Taxes in accordance with  _Article
II_.

Section 5.16 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Effective Time, the

practicable after the Effective Time.

Section 5.17 _Takeover Laws_. If any takeover statute becomes or is deemed to
become applicable to the Company or the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take any and all actions within
their respective control as are permitted under applicable Law and necessary
to eliminate or, if it is not possible to eliminate, then to minimize the
effects of such statutes on the foregoing.

 

Section 5.18 _Transaction Litigation_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
give the other notice, as soon as reasonably practicable under the
circumstances, of any shareholder Proceeding brought by any shareholder of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, against the Company or Parent, as
applicable, or their respective directors or executive officers in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Subject to entry by the Company and Parent into a customary joint defense
agreement with one another, the Company and Parent shall have the right to
participate in the defense of any such Proceeding. The Company shall not
settle or offer to settle any such Proceeding without the prior written
consent Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Parent shall not settle or offer to settle any such Proceeding
without the prior written consent the Company, if such settlement would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of any
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.19 _Resignations_. Prior to the Effective Time, upon Parents
written request, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any
director of the Company to execute and deliver to the Company a letter
effectuating his or her resignation as a director of the Company effective as

Section 5.20 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to applicable Law,
each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other of (a)
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that has resulted or would

the case of the Company) and _Section 6.3_ (in the case of Parent) not being
satisfied, and (b) any notice or other communication received from any
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is

 



-73-  or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject matter of such notice or other
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent would
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (i) no such notification shall, in and of itself, affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder and (ii) failure to
provide such notification under this _Section 5.20_ shall not, in and of
itself, be deemed to implicate any of the conditions to the Closing under
this Agreement.

Section 5.21 _Closing Dividend_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall declare a dividend to its shareholders, the record date for which shall
be the close of business on the last business day prior to the day on which
the Effective Time occurs and the payment date for which shall be three (3)
Business Days after the Effective Time; _provided_ that the payment of such
dividend may be conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time. The per
share dividend amount payable by the Company pursuant to this  _Section
5.21_ shall be an amount equal to the product of (a) the aggregate amount of
cash dividends declared per share of Parent Common Stock with a record date
occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, _multiplied_ by (b) the Exchange Ratio.

Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or otherwise
communicated to the Company Board and not withdrawn on a bona fide basis
without qualification at least five (5) Business Days prior such termination;

 



-78- (B) (1) either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1 _(b)(iii)_  and
(2) after the execution of this Agreement a Company Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly disclosed and not withdrawn on a bona fide basis without
qualification at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Company Shareholders Meeting;

(C) (1) Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ with respect to an intentional
breach of a covenant and (2) after the execution of this Agreement and prior
to the date of the intentional breach that gave rise to such right of
termination a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed
or otherwise communicated to the Company Board and not withdrawn on a bona
fide basis without qualification at least five (5) Business Days prior to such
termination; or

 

(D) (1) Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ prior to receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval and (2) after the execution of this Agreement a
Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or otherwise
communicated to the Company Board; and

 

in the case of each of (A), (B), (C) and (D), within twelve (12) months after
such termination, any Company Acquisition Proposal is consummated or the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Company
Acquisition Proposal (provided that for purposes of this Section 7.3(a)(i),
the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Company
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent
(50%)");

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_; or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(iii)_;

then, in any such case, the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent
the Company Termination Fee. 

(b) Any payment required to be made under this _Section 7.3(a)_ shall be made
by wire transfer of same-day funds to the account or accounts designated by
Parent, (i) in the case of _Section 7.3(a)(i)_, immediately prior to or
substantially concurrently with the entry into a definitive agreement with
respect to (or, if earlier, the consummation of) any Company Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) in the case of _Section 7.3(a)(ii)_, immediately prior to or
concurrently with such termination and (C) in the case of  _Section
7.3(a)(iii)_, within two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Company Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion.

 



-79- (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
except in the case of fraud, if Parent receives payment from the Company of
the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_, such payment
(together with amounts owed, if any pursuant to _Section 7.3(d)_) shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or
future general or limited partners, shareholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Representatives or assignees
(together with the Company, collectively, the "Company Related Parties") for
all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure
to perform hereunder or otherwise, and none of the Company Related Parties
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement and (iii) the Company Termination Fee does not constitute
a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the payment of the Company Termination Fee set forth in this
_Section 7.3_, the Company shall pay Parent its costs and expenses in
connection with such suit (including reasonable attorneys fees), together
with interest on such amount at an annual rate equal to the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date such payment was actually received, or
such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

(a) The parties have participated collectively in the negotiation and drafting
of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
collectively by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this Agreement.

 



-82- (b) The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "herewith" and
words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. References to articles, sections,
paragraphs, exhibits, annexes and schedules are to the articles, sections and
paragraphs of, and exhibits, annexes and schedules to, this Agreement, unless
otherwise specified, and the table of contents and headings in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes"

by the phrase "without limitation." Words describing the singular number
shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa, words denoting any
gender shall be deemed to include all genders, words denoting natural persons
shall be deemed to include business entities and vice versa and references
to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. The term "or"
is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean
the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall
not mean simply "if." The phrases "the date of this Agreement" and "the date
hereof" and terms or phrases of similar import shall be deemed to refer to May
7, 2018, unless the context requires otherwise. Any Law or agreement defined

herein shall mean such Law or agreement as from time to time amended, modified
or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession
of comparable successor Laws ( _provided_ that for purposes of any
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of
a specific date or dates, references to any statute or agreement shall be
deemed to refer to such statute or agreement, as amended, and to any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case, as of such date).

(c) All references to "dollars" or "$" in this Agreement refer to United
States dollars, which is the currency used for all purposes in this Agreement
except as expressly provided otherwise herein. All references to "NIS"
in this Agreement refer to New Israeli Shekels.

Section 8.5 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 

Section 8.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Any
attempted assignment in violation of this Section 8.6 shall be null and void.

 

Section 8.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto), together with the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Company Disclosure Letter

 



-83-  and the Parent Disclosure Letter, constitutes the entire agreement, and
supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

Section 8.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder; _provided_ that it is specifically intended that (a)
the DandO Indemnified Parties (solely with respect to _Section 5.9_ and this 
_Section 8.8_ from and after the Effective Time), (b) from and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Company Ordinary Shares and Company Equity
Awards (solely with respect to _Article II_ and the payment of any

of this _Section 8.8_, the last sentence of Section 8.9,  _Section
8.11(c)_, _Section 8.12_ and _Section 8.15)_, are each intended third-party
beneficiaries hereof.

 

Section 8.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all Proceedings (whether based
on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement hereof, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state without regard
to the conflicts of law provisions thereof, except that (i) the internal
affairs of the corporations party hereto that are organized and existing
under the ICL and (ii) all other provisions of, or transactions contemplated
by, this Agreement that are expressly or otherwise required to be governed by
the ICL shall be governed by the ICL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except to
the extent relating to the interpretation of any provisions in this Agreement
(including those provisions of, and references to, this Agreement that are
referred to, or incorporated by reference in, the Commitment Letter), the
parties hereto agree that any Proceeding of any kind or nature, whether at
law or equity, in contract or in tort, to which the Financing Sources are a
party in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to the
Commitment Letter or the Financing (including the transactions contemplated
thereby) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Law of the
State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict
of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause application of the Law of any jurisdiction
other than the State of New York, except to the extent otherwise provided in
the Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement.

Section 8.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any party hereto does not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and
agree that, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other
party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award

 



-84-  of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law
or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 

Section 8.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby, with respect to any legal claim or
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (i) agrees that any such legal claim or Proceeding shall be
brought, tried and determined only in the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware, or in the event (but only in the event) that such court declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in any state or federal court
located within the State of Delaware, (ii) expressly and irrevocably submits,
for itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally,
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware, or in
the event (but only in the event) that such court declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, in any state or federal court located
within the State of Delaware, (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such courts, (iv) agrees that it will not bring any claim or Proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
except in such courts and (v) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it
may legally and effectively do so, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion
or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any claim or Proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final and nonappealable
judgment in any Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(b) Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process in any claim
or Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect hereof brought by any other party hereto made by mailing
copies thereof by registered or certified United States mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant
to _Section 8.3_ and such service of process shall be sufficient to confer
personal jurisdiction over such party in such claim or Proceeding and shall
otherwise constitute effective and binding service in every respect.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
this _Section 8.11_), each party agrees that it will not bring or support, or
permit any of their controlled Affiliates to bring or support, any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement
or the Financing, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom). 

 



-85- Section 8.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING
RELATING TO THE FINANCING OR INVOLVING A FINANCING SOURCE.

Section 8.13  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by
electronic transmission (including in pdf or other scan format) shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this Agreement and
shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

 

Section 8.14 _Certificates_. In executing any certificate or other
documentation in connection with this Agreement, directors, officers and
employees of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are acting in their capacities
as such and are not assuming personal liability in connection therewith.

 

Section 8.15 _Liability of Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no Financing Source shall have any liability
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Company
or any Affiliate of the Company in connection with this Agreement or the
Financing, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise,
and none of the Company nor any Person that is an Affiliate of the Company
shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Sources hereunder. This
_Section 8.15_ shall not impair, limit or affect any claims or causes of
action related to agreements entered into with the Financing Sources by the
parties thereto.
