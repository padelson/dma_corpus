THE MERGER; CERTAIN RELATED MATTERS

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue its existence under Delaware
law as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_

(b) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and

local time, on the third Business Day after the satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VII (other than those conditions that, by their nature or terms, can only be

permitted by applicable Law, waiver of such conditions), at the offices of
Bass, Berry and Sims PLC, 150 Third Avenue South, Suite 2800, Nashville,
Tennessee, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter referred
to as the " _Closing Date_."

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Immediately following the Closing on
the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form
as required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the
applicable provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of such filing, or if
another date and time is agreed to by the parties and specified in such
filing, such specified date and time, being the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation_. Subject to Section 6.8(c), at the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended in its entirety to read as set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto,
until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and the DGCL.

Section 1.5 _Bylaws_. Subject to Section 6.8(c), at the Effective Time, the

2 Section 1.6 _Board of Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the parties
hereto shall take all requisite action such that the directors of Merger Sub

shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier
of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified.

Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time, shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their death,
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
appointed and qualified.

ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or any holder of any shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "):

 

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock that is held by the Company as treasury
stock or owned by the Company (other than shares of Company Common Stock held
either in a fiduciary or agency capacity that are beneficially owned by third
parties), Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), if any, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be
automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration or payment shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor or in payment thereof.

(b) Subject to Section 2.1(a), Section 2.2 and Section 2.3, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including any shares of Company Common Stock held in a Company Benefit
Plan or related trust) shall automatically be converted into the right to
receive $77.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As
of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to
be outstanding, shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company
Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") or shares of Company Common Stock held in
book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive, in accordance with this Section
2.1(b), the Merger Consideration, upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.4, without interest.

 

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, shall automatically be converted into one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

Section 2.2 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a

 



3  different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination,
subdivision, exchange of shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction,
or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a
record date within said period, the Merger Consideration and any other
similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to
provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event, provided that nothing in
this Section 2.2 shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action
with respect to its securities, including the Company Common Stock, that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
are held by any Person who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who has properly exercised and perfected appraisal
rights of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to, and who complies in
all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section_ __ _ 262_") shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in Section 2.1(b) with respect to such Appraisal Shares but rather the holders
of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by
Section 262 to the holders of such Appraisal Shares (it being understood and
acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Appraisal Shares shall no longer
be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than
the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares to the extent
afforded by Section 262); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any holder of
Company Common Stock fails to properly perfect or effectively waives or
withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal under Section
262 with respect to such Appraisal Shares, or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such Appraisal Shares shall cease and each such Appraisal Share
shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to
have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(b), without interest and less any
applicable Tax withholding, upon the surrender of the Certificates
representing such shares or transfer of such Book-Entry Shares, as the case
may be, in accordance with this Agreement. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any
shares of Company Common Stock, of any withdrawals of such demands and of any
other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 and received by the Company
relating to appraisal demands and Parent shall have the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.4 _Exchange of_ _Company Common Stock_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
exchange agent agreement with the Companys transfer agent or a nationally
recognized financial institution selected by Parent with the Companys prior
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to act as exchange agent

 



4  in the Merger for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares for the aggregate Merger Consideration issuable and payable in respect
thereof. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, cash
in the amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash
provided to the Exchange Agent being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver the cash
contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1 out of the Exchange Fund. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. In the event the
Exchange Fund is diminished below the level required for the Exchange
Agent to make prompt cash payments as required under Section 2.1(b), Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to promptly deposit
additional cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is
at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make
such payments under Section 2.1(b). Nothing contained in this Section 2.4(a)
and no investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with
the Exchange Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of Company Common
Stock to receive the Merger Consideration. The exchange agent agreement
pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Exchange Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.4(a) shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (or in the
case of The Depository Trust Company on behalf of "street" holders, deliver),
as soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than three (3) Business Days)
following the Effective Time, to each holder of record of a Certificate
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares), (A) a
letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall have such other provisions as are reasonably satisfactory to both of the
Company and Parent) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided
in Section 2.4(f)) to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger
Consideration issuable and payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Excluded Shares or Appraisal
Shares) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as practicable, the
cash amount equal to (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Subject to 

 



5  Section 2.3, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.4, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into
which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate have been converted into pursuant to Section 2.1(b). No interest
shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Article II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record
of one or more Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message" or such
other evidence, if any, reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent in
compliance with the Exchange Agents customary procedure with respect to the
exchange of book-entry shares (other than Book-Entry Shares representing
Excluded Shares or Appraisal Shares), be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as soon

upon cancellation of any Book-Entry Shares.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer

Article II upon the surrender of the Certificates or the Book-Entry Shares
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. After the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding

(e) _No Liability_. If, immediately prior to such time on which any payment
in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws,
any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the
procedures in Section 2.4(b) to receive payment of the Merger Consideration to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, Company Options, Company RSU Awards or
Company PSU Awards will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of

 



6  the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the
Exchange Fund (including any amounts delivered to Parent in accordance with
Section 2.4(d)) properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, to the extent required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in reasonable amount as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall
pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration that would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered as
provided in this Article II.

 

(g) _Investment_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such

bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank
which are then publicly available), or (iv) a combination of the foregoing.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the
property of and paid to Parent; _provided_ that no losses on any investment
made pursuant to this Section 2.4(g) shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such
consideration, and following any such losses, Parent shall promptly cause to
be provided additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders
of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration in
the amount of any such losses or if for any reason such funds are unavailable
for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. 

(h) _Withholdings_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the

_Code_ ") or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. Any
amount properly deducted or withheld pursuant to this Section 2.4(h) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. Parent
shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts so deducted or withheld to
the appropriate Taxing Authority within the period required under applicable
Law.

 



7 Section 2.5 _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

holder to receive, on the next regularly scheduled payroll date that is no
earlier than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, a cash
payment (without interest and subject to applicable Taxes) from the Surviving
Corporation with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Merger without any action on the part of the holder thereof and without any
payment to the holder thereof.

time-vesting restricted stock unit award granted by the Company in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company RSU Award_ ") and each

or Company PSU Award to receive, on the next regularly scheduled payroll date
that is no earlier than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, a
cash payment (without interest and subject to applicable Taxes) from the
Surviving Corporation with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock then underlying such Company RSU
Award or Company PSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) the Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to
any Company PSU Award the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying
such Company PSU Award shall be the number to which the holder would otherwise
have been entitled assuming target level of performance; and _provided
further,_ that to the extent that any Company RSU Award or Company PSU Award
constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the
Code, such cash payment shall be paid in accordance with the applicable
awards terms and at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such award
that will not result in the application of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A
of the Code, including payment in accordance with any applicable exception or
permitted payment event under Section 409A of the Code and Section 1.409A-3(j)
of the Treasury Regulations.

Directors of the Company or the appropriate committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take
any actions which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of

to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such amendment, contain any

procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are

paragraph (e) of Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules
13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
(both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
The Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required
by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company SEC Document that is a
report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions

of the Board of Directors of the Company (i) any "significant deficiencies"
and "material weaknesses" in the design or operation of its internal controls
over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. The terms "significant
deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" have the meanings assigned to such
terms in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Since April 24, 2015, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company or its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting procedures, except as would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Since April 24, 2015, the Company and the Companys

respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations of NASDAQ and all certifications required by NASDAQ have been

schedules thereto) of the Company included in or incorporated by reference
into the Company SEC Documents (if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment filed prior to the date of this Agreement) (the " _Company SEC
Financial Statements_ ") comply in all material respects as to form with
applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act
and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. The
Company SEC Financial Statements fairly present, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated results
of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the
respective periods then ended, were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved, except as set forth in
Section 3.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter (except (x) in the case of the
unaudited statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and to the
absence of information or notes not required by GAAP to be included in interim
financial statements, and (y) with respect to pro forma information, subject
to the qualifications stated therein) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto),
and have been prepared in accordance with, the books and records of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it
have any commitment to become a party to, any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K). Since April 24,
2015, there has been no transaction, or series of similar transactions, nor

Section 3.12 _Employee Benefit Plans and Related Matters; ERISA_.

 

(a) Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the date
of this Agreement a list of material Company Benefit Plans, including all
Company Benefit Plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "). With respect to each material Company
Benefit Plan, the Company has made available to Parent a true and complete
copy of such written Company Benefit Plan and, to the extent applicable, (i)
all material plan or program documents, trust agreements, insurance contracts
or other funding arrangements, (ii) the most recent actuarial and
trust reports for both ERISA funding and financial statement purposes, (iii)
the most recent Form 5500 with all attachments filed with the Internal Revenue
Service (" _IRS_ ") or the Department of Labor, (iv) the most recent
IRS determination letter (or opinion letter upon which the Company is
entitled to rely), and (v) all current summary plan descriptions. " _Company
Benefit Plans_ " means each employee benefit plan, scheme, program, policy,
arrangement and contract (including any "employee benefit

 



17  plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, and any bonus, deferred
compensation, fringe benefit, stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock,
stock option or other equity-based arrangement, and any employment,
termination, retention, bonus, golden parachute, change in control or
severance agreement, plan, program, policy, arrangement or contract) under
which any current or former director, officer or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has any present or future right to benefits, that is
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligation to maintain, sponsor or contribute, or with respect to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries would incur any direct or indirect
liability.

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered and operated in
accordance with its terms and with applicable Law, except as would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All material contributions, premiums and
benefit payments under or in connection with each Company Benefit Plan that
are required to have been made in accordance with the terms of such Company
Benefit Plan have been timely made and will be timely made by the Company or
its Subsidiaries for all periods ending at the Effective Time, except as
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Benefit Plan
and related trust, if any, intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a)
or 501(a) is qualified and has received a favorable determination or opinion
letter from the IRS with respect to such qualified or tax-exempt status, and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has since occurred that would
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of any such plans qualified or tax-
exempt status.

(c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors or contributes to a
Title IV Plan. No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been
incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in
full, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability, including by reason of
being a member in a controlled group within the meaning of Code Section 414,
in each instance, which would have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As used
in this Agreement, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " of any entity means any other entity
that, together with such entity, would be treated as a single employer under
Section 4001(b) of ERISA.

 

(d) There are no pending actions or claims with respect to any of the Company
Benefit Plans by any employee or otherwise involving any such plan or the
assets of any such plan (other than routine claims for benefits), and no basis
or facts exist that would give rise to any such action or claim, except, in
such case, as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or is a "multiple employer plan" within
the meaning of Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate has at any time during the last six
(6) years contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any such type of
plan, nor is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries liable, directly or
indirectly, with respect to any such plan for a complete or partial withdrawal
(within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA), due to the termination or
reorganization of such a plan, or otherwise.

 



18 (f) Except as set forth on Section 3.12(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
and except as provided in this Agreement or as required by applicable Law,
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
will not (i) entitle any current or former director, officer or employee of
the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any similar
payment under any Company Benefit Plan, or (ii) result in any payment becoming
due, accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due to any such director, officer or employee under any Company
Benefit Plan.

(g) No amount that is likely to be received (whether in cash or property or
the vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by any employee, officer or director of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)
would be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is
defined in Section 280G(B)(1) of the Code.

faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation

by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

Effective Time or the date of termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.1, the Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents not to,
and shall direct each of its investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants and other representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ _"_ ) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
offer or proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any nonpublic information regarding
the Company or its Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with or in
response to an Acquisition Proposal, other than informing such Person of the
existence of this Section 6.3, or (iii) engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in, any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
other Person any information in connection with or for the purpose of
soliciting, initiating, knowingly encouraging or knowingly facilitating, any
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that upon receipt of a bona
fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from any Person that did
not result from a breach of this Section 6.3, (x) the Company and its
Representatives may contact the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and
its Representatives to ascertain facts or clarify terms and conditions for the
sole purpose of the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof informing itself about the Acquisition Proposal and the Person that
made it and (y) if, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, but
not after, following the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, and that the
failure to take the actions contemplated by this clause (y) would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, the Company and the Company Representatives may,
in response to such Acquisition Proposal, and subject to compliance with
Section 6.3(d), (A) furnish information with respect to the Company to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives and financing
sources pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that contains provisions no
less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not contain any standstill or similar obligation that would
prohibit or restrain such Person from

 



35  making, or amending or revising, an Acquisition Proposal); _provided_ that
the Company concurrently furnishes Parent with all such nonpublic information
delivered to such Person, to the extent not previously made available to
Parent; and _provided further_ , that if the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal is a known competitor of the Company, the Company shall not provide
any commercially sensitive non-public information to such Person in connection
with any actions permitted by this Section 6.3 other than in accordance with
customary "clean room" or other similar procedures designed to limit any
adverse effect on the Company of the sharing of such information, and (B)
engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person regarding such
Acquisition Proposal (including solicitation of revised or amended Acquisition
Proposals). The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly
request any Person that has executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure
agreement in connection with any actual or potential Acquisition Proposal
to return or destroy all confidential information in the possession of such
Person or its Representatives. The Company agrees that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.3 by any of its Representatives or
any of its Affiliates shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.3 by
the Company.

(b) Except as expressly permitted by Section 6.3(c), the Board of Directors
of the Company (and each committee thereof) shall not (i) (A) fail to include
the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change,
qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation, (C) adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders
of the Company, or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention
to adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of the Company, an Acquisition
Proposal, (D) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within ten (10) Business Days of the occurrence of a material event or
development and after Parent so requests in writing (or if the Company
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held within ten (10) Business Days,
then within one Business Day after Parent so requests) or (E) take or fail to
take any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation in
connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation
against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication contemplated by
Section 6.3(f) (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as
a " _Recommendation Withdrawal_ "), or (ii) approve, adopt, recommend or
authorize, or cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement (including
an acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other
agreement), commitment or agreement in principle with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in
accordance with Section 6.3(a)) (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including Sections
6.1 and 6.2, but subject to compliance with this Section 6.3, prior to receipt
of the Company Stockholder Approval, but not after, the Board of Directors of
the Company may, in response to any bona fide, unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal from any Person that did not result from a breach of this Section
6.3, make a Recommendation Withdrawal, and subject to compliance with this
Section 6.3(c) and Section 8.3(a) (including the payment of the Termination
Fee), terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a binding agreement in
respect of such Acquisition Proposal, if, and only if, prior to taking either
such action (A) the Company has complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Section 6.3; (B) the Board of Directors of the Company
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal 

 



36  counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (C)
the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take the
actions contemplated by this Section 6.3(c) would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; (D)
the Board of Directors of the Company, prior to making a Recommendation
Withdrawal or terminating this Agreement, as applicable, provides Parent with
at least four (4) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take
such action, specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and
conditions of, and the identity of the Person making, any such Acquisition
Proposal and has contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the Superior
Proposal, a copy of any proposed Company Acquisition Agreements and a copy of
any financing commitments relating thereto (or, in each case, if not provided
in writing to the Company, a written summary of the terms and conditions
thereof) (it being agreed that the delivery of such notice by the Company
shall not constitute a Recommendation Withdrawal); (E) during the four (4)
Business Days following such written notice (or such shorter period as is
specified below), if requested by Parent, the Board of Directors of the
Company and its Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith with
Parent and its Representatives to enable Parent to propose in writing
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that, if accepted by the Company
and binding upon Parent, would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal; and (F) at the end of the four (4) Business
Day period described in the foregoing clause (D), the Board of Directors of
the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel (and after taking into account
any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent that would, if accepted by the Company, be binding upon Parent), that
the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and failure to
take the actions contemplated by this Section 6.3(c) would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Law. Any change to any of the financial terms of the Acquisition Proposal
(including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any
other material terms of the Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and the Company will be
required to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.3(c) anew with
respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the Company
makes a Recommendation Withdrawal or seeks to terminate this Agreement
as provided above in connection with any such new Acquisition Proposal, the
notice period and the period during which the Company and its Representatives
are required, if requested by Parent, to negotiate with Parent regarding any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in
response to such new Acquisition Proposal pursuant to clauses (D) and (E)
above shall expire on the later to occur of (x) 48 hours after the Company
provides written notice of such new Acquisition Proposal to Parent or (y) the
expiration of the four (4) Business Day period described in clause (C) above.
Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any Company Acquisition
Agreement unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms or such entry is contemporaneous with such termination.

 

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 6.3(a),
Section 6.3(b) and Section 6.3(c), the Company shall promptly, and in any
event no later than 48 hours after it receives any Acquisition Proposal,
advise Parent in writing of any request for confidential information in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of such request or Acquisition Proposal and
shall keep Parent

 



37  reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis (but in no event more
often than once every 48 hours) of all material modifications to the terms of
any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall as promptly as practicable (and
in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent if the Board of Directors of the
Company makes a determination that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, or if the
Company furnishes information or enters into discussions or negotiations as
provided in Section 6.3(a).

(e) Other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company may,
at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, but not
after, make a Recommendation Withdrawal in response to a Company Intervening
Event (an "Intervening Event Recommendation Withdrawal") if (i) the Company
has complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section
6.3 and (ii) prior to taking such action, the Board of Directors of the
Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , that prior to making such
Intervening Event Recommendation Withdrawal, (A) the Company has given Parent
at least four (4) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take
such action, and specifying the reasons therefor, including specifying in
reasonable detail the applicable Company Intervening Event, (B) if requested
by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives during such notice period to enable Parent to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement, and (C) following the end of such
notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have considered in
good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing
by Parent that would, if accepted by the Company, be binding upon Parent, and
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make an Intervening
Event Recommendation Withdrawal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company or the
Board of Directors of the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)(2-3) or
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any "stop, look
and listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder;
_provided_ , that no such action or disclosure that would amount to
a Recommendation Withdrawal shall be permitted, made or taken other than in
compliance with this Section 6.3.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any Person (other
than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) relating to, or that
would reasonably be expected to lead to, (i) any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, of assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the
Company) or businesses that constitute 20% or more of the assets, revenue or
net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or
more of any class of equity securities or voting power of the Company, (ii)
any tender offer or exchange offer (including a self-tender offer) that if
consummated would result in any Person or group of Persons beneficially owning
(which has the meaning under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) securities
of the Company representing

 



38  20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock or 20% or more of the
aggregate voting power of all securities of the Company, (iii) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, pursuant to which any
Person or the stockholders of any Person would own securities of the Company
or of any resulting direct or indirect parent company of the Company
representing 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock or 20% or
more of the aggregate voting power of all securities of the Company or of any
resulting direct or indirect parent company of the Company, or (iv) any
combination of the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the
percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or earnings and
Company Common Stock (or voting power of securities of the Company other than
the Company Common Stock) involved is 20% or more;

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal (a) that, if consummated, would result in a third party (or in the
case of a direct merger between such third party and the Company, the
stockholders of such third party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more
than 50% of the outstanding Company Common Stock or more than 50% of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (b) to the
extent consideration includes cash, includes financing commitments from
reputable sources that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably
determines in good faith are reasonably expected to be available and that are
sufficient, together with cash on hand and availability under existing credit
facilities, to fund such cash consideration, and (c) that is on terms that,
taken as a whole, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith (after consulting with its outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel), and taking into account (i) all financial considerations, (ii) the
identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, (iii) the anticipated
timing, likelihood of consummation (including governmental approvals,
conditions to consummation and financing terms) relative to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, conditions and prospects for completion of
such Acquisition Proposal, (iv) the other terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal and the implications thereof on the Company, including
all relevant legal, regulatory, tax and financial aspects of such Acquisition
Proposal, and the Person making the proposal, (v) any changes to this
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent that would, if accepted by
the Company, be binding upon Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal,
and (vi) any other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal deemed relevant by the
Board of Directors of the Company, are more favorable from a financial point
of view to the stockholders of the Company than the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; and

" _Company Intervening Event_ " means any fact, circumstance, occurrence,
event, development, change or condition or combination thereof that materially
affects the business, assets or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
which (a) was not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Board of
Directors of the Company as of or prior to the date of this Agreement and (b)
does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that any change in
the price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock, in and of itself,
shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether a Company
Intervening Event has occurred (it being understood, however, that any fact,
circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or condition giving rise
or contributing to such changes in the price or trading volume of the Company
Common Stock may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether a
Company Intervening Event has occurred).

 



39 Section 6.4 _Access to Information_. The Company shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, afford the Representatives of Parent reasonable
access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to its
and its Subsidiaries properties, books and records and personnel, and shall
furnish, and shall cause to be furnished, as promptly as reasonably
practicable to Parent consistent with its legal obligations and obligations
pursuant to Contracts all other information concerning the Companys and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) such access shall not interfere
with the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (b) the
Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if the
Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate
applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third
party, jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege or attorney
work product doctrine, or expose such party to risk of liability for
disclosure of sensitive or personal information (any such information, the "
_Restricted Information_ "), _provided further_ , that the Company will
inform Parent of the general nature of the Restricted Information and
reasonably cooperate with Parent to provide the Restricted Information in a
manner that would not result in violation of Law or Contract or obligation of
confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize the protection of such
privilege or expose the party to such risk, and (c) the Company will be
permitted to redact any information or documentation provided to the extent
that such information or documentation includes competitively or commercially
sensitive information or, in lieu thereof, at the request of Parent, provide
unredacted information and documentation in accordance with customary "clean
room" or other similar procedures designed to limit any adverse effect on the
Company of the sharing of such information. In conducting any inspection of
any properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent and its
Representatives shall not (i) interfere with the business conducted at such
property or (ii) damage any property or any portion thereof. Prior to the
Effective Time, without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent and
its Representatives shall not have the right to conduct environmental testing
or sampling at any of the facilities or properties of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. All information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall
continue to be governed by the Confidentiality Agreement which shall remain
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Nothing in this Section
6.4 shall require the Company to permit the inspection of, or to disclose, any
information regarding or related to the deliberations of the Board of
Directors of the Company with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the entry into this Agreement or any materials provided to the
Board of Directors of the Company in connection therewith.

 

Section 6.5 _Consents, Approvals and Filings_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, as
promptly as practicable, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Merger as promptly as practicable, including to use reasonable
best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, (i) cause all of the conditions
to Closing to be satisfied, (ii) prepare and file all filings and submissions
under the HSR Act, in connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals,
(iii) obtain all Consents, Orders, actions or nonactions, waivers and

 



40  clearances required under the HSR Act, in connection with the Requisite
Regulatory Approval, and (iv) obtain all material consents or waivers
from non-Governmental Entity third parties; _provided_ that in no event shall
the Company or its Subsidiaries be obligated to, or shall agree to, pay or to
commit to pay to any Person whose consent or waiver is being sought any cash
or other consideration, or make any accommodation or commitment or incur any
liability or other obligation to such Person in connection with such consent
or waiver, unless Parent (i) has consented in writing to such payment,
accommodation or commitment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and (ii) agreed to reimburse the Company for the
Companys or its Subsidiaries actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with such payment, accommodation or commitment in the
event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1(a),
Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d)(i). Subject to this Section 6.5(a), neither
Parent nor the Company shall knowingly take any action that is reasonably
likely to have the effect of materially delaying, impairing or impeding the
receipt of any required authorizations, consents, orders or approvals in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent agrees to comply
with its obligations set forth in Section 6.5(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter. In furtherance and not in limitation thereof, not later
than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Company
and Parent shall each make an appropriate filing of a notification and report
form pursuant to the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice with respect to
the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and the Company
shall promptly notify the other party of any notice or other communication
from any Governmental Entity received by such party alleging that such
Governmental Entitys consent is or may be required in connection with or as a
condition of the Merger.

 

(b) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate
and coordinate with the other party in the taking of the actions contemplated
by Section 6.5(a), (ii) provide such assistance as the other party may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing, including supplying the
other party with any information that the other party may reasonably request
in order to effectuate the taking of such actions, and (iii) keep the other
party reasonably and timely informed of any developments, meetings, or
discussions with any Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Laws, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information, from any Governmental
Entity under any Antitrust Laws. If the Company or Parent receives a formal or
informal request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby, then it shall use reasonable best
efforts to make, or cause to be made, as promptly as reasonably practicable
and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. In addition, to the extent practicable, none of
the parties hereto shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting or
conference (telephone, in-person or otherwise) with any Governmental Entity,
or any member of the staff of any Governmental Entity, in respect of any
Filing, proceeding, investigation (including any settlement of the
investigation), litigation, or other inquiry under any Antitrust Laws unless
it consults with the other party in advance and, where permitted by such
Governmental Entity, allows the other party to participate. To the extent
reasonably practicable, legal counsel for Parent and for the Company shall
have the right to review in advance, and will consult with the other party on
and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with,
all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
and any of their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives, that appears in
any filing made with, or written

 



41  materials submitted to, any third party or Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. In exercising
the foregoing rights, each of Parent and the Company shall act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable. Information disclosed pursuant to this Section 6.5
shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 6.5(e) hereof.
Neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to comply with any of the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.5(b) to the extent that such compliance
would be prohibited by applicable Law. The parties shall not voluntarily
extend any waiting period associated with any Consent of any Governmental
Entity or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except
with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
including Sections 6.5(a) and (b), neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of
their Affiliates shall be required to, and the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, become subject to, consent to, or offer or
agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (i) sell,
license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any
assets, business or portion of business of Company, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates, (ii) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets, business or portion of business of the Company, Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates in any manner, (iii) impose any
restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or
portion of the business of Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates; provided that, if requested by Parent, the Company shall become
subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action
with respect to, any such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding,
agreement or order so long as such requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order is only binding on the Company in the event
the Closing occurs, or (iv) materially modify or waive any of the terms or
conditions of this Agreement. In addition, in furtherance and not in
limitation of the other provisions of this Section 6.5, Parent shall take all
actions (A) necessary to defend, including through pursuing litigation on the
merits, any administrative or judicial Proceeding asserted or threatened by
any Governmental Entity or other Person under Antitrust Laws (including
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and/or judicial appeal) that
seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent, restrain, impede,
delay, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) necessary in order to avoid
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, overturned or terminated, any
Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) entered, issued or
threatened under Antitrust Laws that would prevent, impede, delay, enjoin
or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, prior to the Initial Outside Date (or if the
Initial Outside Date has been extended pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), then the
Outside Date);  _provided, however_ , that the obligations set forth in this
sentence shall not require Parent to take, and/or to cause its Subsidiaries to
take, any actions other than to otherwise comply with its obligations set
forth in this Section 6.5(c).

(d) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, acquire, purchase, lease or license (or agree to acquire,
purchase, lease or license), by merging with or into or consolidating with, or
by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or
other business organization or division or part thereof, or any securities or
collection of assets, if

 



42  doing so would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay in
the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any
Consent, action or nonaction, waiver, clearance or exemption of any
Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of
any Governmental Entity entering an Order preventing, restraining, impeding,
delaying, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) materially increase the
risk of not being able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise; or
(iv) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.5, (i) if any
information or documentation provided by the delivering party to the other
party pursuant to this Section 6.5 contains competitively or commercially
sensitive material, if requested by the delivering party, such information or
documentation will only be provided to outside antitrust counsel of
the receiving party (and/or to such other individuals of the receiving party
or the Representatives thereof to whom the delivering party expressly provides
permission (the " _Permitted Individuals_ ")) and shall not be disclosed by
such outside antitrust counsel or other Permitted Individuals to any
individuals other than Permitted Individuals (including employees, officers or
directors of the receiving party) unless express permission is obtained in
advance from the delivering party and (ii) any information or documentation
provided to the other party pursuant to this Section 6.5 may be redacted to
the extent necessary (A) to comply with any contractual arrangement, (B) to
remove references concerning valuation, or (C) to address privilege or
confidentiality concerns.

(f) The parties acknowledge and agree that Parent shall have the principal
responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any
Requisite Regulatory Approvals and lead and direct all filings (including
where to file), process, negotiation of settlements (if any) and related
proceedings contemplated by this Section 6.5, and the Company will cooperate
reasonably, subject to applicable Law, therewith; _provided_ , _however,_ that
Parent shall consult in advance (to the extent reasonably practicable) with
the Company, and give due consideration in good faith to the Companys views
regarding such strategy, filings, processes, negotiations and proceedings.

 

Section 6.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Benefits
Continuation Period_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall provide, or cause to
be provided, for those employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
continue as employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
during all or a portion of the Benefits Continuation Period (the "
_Continuing Employees_ "), compensation (including base salary, bonus and
other incentive compensation opportunities) and employee benefits that in the
aggregate with respect to each Continuing Employee shall not be any less
favorable than the compensation and employee benefits (excluding (i) any
special bonuses, accelerated equity payments, and dividend equivalent payments
on equity awards, in each case, resulting from the sale of the restaurants
business; and (ii) accelerated equity payments, dividend equivalent payment
on equity awards, any excess portion of any short term incentive payments and
change in control bonuses or severance payments, in each case, payable as a
result of the Merger) provided by the Company

 



43  or the applicable Subsidiary to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time (such compensation and employees benefits referred to as
" _Comparable Benefits_ "). Parent shall maintain full discretion as to
whether to provide such Comparable Benefits under Company plans or
arrangements or under plans or arrangements of Parent or its subsidiaries.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any
current or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other
than as provided in any applicable employment agreement or other Contract, to
restrict the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate
the employment of any such employee.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall (i) waive, or shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its insurance carriers to waive, any applicable
pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements in any replacement or successor
welfare benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation in which a Continuing
Employee is eligible to participate following the Effective Time to the extent
such exclusions or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied
by, such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under
the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each
Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
during the portion of the relevant plan year prior to the Effective Time (to
the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan
prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-
of-pocket requirements, and (iii) recognize service prior to the Effective
Time with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting, determination of level of benefits and benefits
accrual to the same extent such service was recognized by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it
would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service;
and, _provided_ _further_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to provide credit for years of service for benefit accrual purposes
under any defined benefit pension plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation
or its Subsidiaries prior to the date on which the Continuing Employee
actually becomes a participant in such plan.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms, (i) each employment,
change in control, severance and termination protection plan, policy or
agreement of or between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
current or former officer, director or employee, identified in Section 6.6(c)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, (ii) all obligations in effect as of the
Effective Time under any equity-based, bonus or bonus deferral plans,
programs or agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries identified in
Section 6.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (iii) all obligations in
effect as of the Effective Time pursuant to outstanding retention plans,
programs or agreements, and all vested and accrued benefits under any employee
benefit, employment compensation or similar plans, programs, agreements or
arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries identified in Section
6.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent may terminate or amend or may cause the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries to terminate or amend the benefits or arrangements listed in
(c)(i), (c)(ii) or (c)(iii) above, in all cases with such termination or
amendment being subject to the terms of the applicable arrangement, except
that: (x) no termination or amendment

 



44  to reduce or eliminate benefits may occur with respect to benefits or
arrangements that have already become vested or accrued or payable; and (y)
with respect to any change in control severance plan, policy or agreement ("
_CIC Severance Program_ "), no termination or amendment to reduce or eliminate
benefits or participants rights may occur so long as change in control
severance benefits might vest, accrue or otherwise become payable under such
CIC Severance Program. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the consummation
of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
constitute a change in control of the Company under the terms of the
Companys employee plans, programs, arrangements and contracts containing
provisions triggering payment, vesting or other rights upon a change in
control or similar transaction.

 

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries,
for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending ninety (90) days
thereafter, not to effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those
terms are defined in WARN affecting in whole or in part any site of
employment, facility, or operating unit of the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries not to take any such action after such ninety (90) day period
without complying with all provisions of WARN.

 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Continuing
Employees whose employment terminates during the Benefits Continuation Period

Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any.

(f) With respect to the Company Deferred Compensation Plans, prior to
the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company or the
appropriate committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable,
shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are (i) reasonably
necessary to ensure that (A) any portion of the account balances thereunder
denominated in or otherwise tied to the value of a share of Company Common
Stock be converted as of the Effective Time to the Merger Consideration in
lieu of each such share of Company Common Stock, and (B) from and after the
Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required
to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the
Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person pursuant to or
in settlement of any obligations thereunder. Following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall consult with Parent in good faith and give due
consideration to Parents views in connection with the Companys
determination of whether the Company Deferred Compensation Plans shall
continue after the Closing or whether they shall be terminated effective as of
the Closing and the account balances thereunder paid out after the Effective
Time and in any event in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of
the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i)
shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit
Plan, (ii) shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Person, or
(iii) subject to the requirements of this Section 6.6, shall limit the right
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan following the Closing
Date.

Agreement, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees to assume
liability for and pay any sales, transfer, stamp, stock transfer, value added,
use, real property transfer or gains and any similar Taxes, as well as any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees that may be imposed upon,
payable or incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.8 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and
Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, jointly and severally, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law (including to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by any amendments to or replacements of applicable Law adopted after
the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which indemnification
may be provided), indemnify, defend and hold harmless (and promptly advance
expenses from time to time as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
_provided_ the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides a reasonable and
customary undertaking (which shall not include posting of any collateral) to
repay such advances, if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification) each Person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the Effective Time or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any Person
acting as director, officer, trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of another
entity or enterprise (including any Company Benefit Plan) who is or has
acted as such at the request of the Company (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ")
from and against any and all costs or expenses (including attorneys fees,
expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
penalties, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or incurred in
connection with any actual or threatened claim (including a claim of violation
of applicable Law), action, audit, demand, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative or other
proceeding at law or in equity or order or ruling, by reason of the fact that
the Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or is or was a director, officer, trustee, fiduciary, employee
or agent of another Person at the request of the Company, including the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby or arising out of or pertaining to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, whether asserted or claimed prior to,
at or after the Effective Time. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
reasonably cooperate with any Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter
covered by this Section 6.8. Without limitation of the foregoing or any other
provision of this Section 6.8, Parent and the Company agree that all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liability for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time and the rights to advancement of expenses
relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party, whether
provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in existence as of the date hereof and set forth on
Section 6.8(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall survive the Merger, be
honored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and continue in full
force and effect, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any
such Indemnified Party.

 



46 (b) Subject to the following sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, either (i) continue to maintain in full force and effect for
six (6) years from the Effective Time, if available, the current directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (the "
_Current Insurance_ ") with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby);  _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute for the Current Insurance policies of at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions that are not less favorable in the aggregate
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby); or
(ii) purchase a six (6) year extended reporting period endorsement with
respect to the Current Insurance (a " _Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ") and
maintain this endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. To the
extent purchased after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, such insurance policies shall be placed through such broker(s) and with
such insurance carriers as may be specified by Parent and as are reasonably
acceptable to the Company; _provided_ that such insurance carrier has at least
an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance. Notwithstanding the first
sentence of this Section 6.8(b), but subject to the second sentence of this
Section 6.8(b), the Company shall be permitted at its sole and exclusive
option to purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount
in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for
such insurance; and, if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount; _provided_ that in
the event of the Current Insurance, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
be required to obtain as much coverage as is possible under substantially
similar policies for such maximum annual amount in aggregate annual premiums.

(c) Immediately following the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall include provisions for
indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation of
the Indemnified Parties that are, in substance, no less favorable to the
Indemnified Parties than the provisions for indemnification, advancement and
reimbursement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnified Parties as set
forth in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws in effect on the date of
this Agreement. For six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain in effect the provisions in its certificate of incorporation and
bylaws providing for indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of
expenses and exculpation of Indemnified Parties, as applicable, with respect
to the facts or circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent permitted from time to time under applicable Law, which
provisions shall not be amended except as required by applicable Law or
except to make changes permitted by applicable Law that would enlarge the
scope of the Indemnified Parties indemnification and advancement rights
thereunder.

 



47 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause proper provisions to be made prior to the consummation of any
transaction of the type described in clause (i) or clause (ii) of this
sentence so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth
in this Section 6.8.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not, directly or indirectly, amend, modify, limit or terminate the
advancement and reimbursement of expenses, exculpation, indemnification
provisions of the agreements listed in Section 6.8(e) of the Company
Disclosure Letter between the Company or any Subsidiary and any of the
Indemnified Parties, or any such provisions contained in the Surviving
Corporation bylaws.

 

(f) This Section 6.8 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant
third-party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.8
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any Indemnified Party unless the affected Indemnified Party shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification. It is expressly
agreed that each Indemnified Party shall be a third-party beneficiary of this
Section 6.8, and entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section
6.8. If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Section 6.8 that is denied by Parent and/or
the Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines
that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification or advancement,
then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay such Indemnified Partys
costs and expenses, including legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection
with pursuing such claim against Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation. The
rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.8 shall be in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any rights such Indemnified Parties may have
under the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of any of
the Subsidiaries of the Company or the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or
under any applicable Contracts, insurance policies or Laws and Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under all
indemnification agreements listed in Section 6.8(e) of the Company Disclosure
Letter entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries for any of their
respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.8 is not prior
to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release concerning this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press
release approved in advance by the Company and Parent. Following such initial
press release, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing, and give each other the opportunity to 

 



48  review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.9 shall not apply to any release or

with Section 6.3 (in which case the Company shall provide to Parent a draft
of such public announcement or statement as far in advance of its release as
reasonably practicable, or (b) in response to questions by the press,

Parent (or made by one party after having consulted with the other party).

 

Section 6.10 _Notice of Certain Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such
party from (x) any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, or (y) any Person
alleging that the consent of or a waiver by such Person is or may be required

contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the
failure of such party to obtain such consent or waiver could be material to
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any Proceedings
commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against such party which
relates to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) any Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, and (iv) any effect, change, event or occurrence, including if to such
partys Knowledge any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate, that would be reasonably likely to
result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Article VII to be
satisfied.

 

Section 6.11 _Transaction Litigation_. Each party shall promptly notify the
other parties in writing of any stockholder litigation or other litigation or
proceedings arising from this Agreement or the Merger that is brought against
such party or any of its Affiliates or members of its board of directors ("
_Transaction Litigation_ "). Each party shall keep the other parties
sufficiently informed on a reasonably current basis with respect to the status
of any Transaction Litigation (including by promptly furnishing to the other
parties hereto such information relating to the Transaction Litigation as may
be reasonably requested). The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in the defense (at Parents sole cost and subject to a joint
defense agreement) of any Transaction Litigation. No settlement of any
Transaction Litigation shall be agreed to by the Company without Parents
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law (or provision) on this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.13 _Delisting_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,

as practicable following the Effective Time and terminate its registration
under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following such delisting.

Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
to deliver all notices and take all other reasonable actions required to
facilitate (i) the termination of commitments under the Credit Agreement, (ii)

Outside Date has been extended pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), then the Outside
Date); _provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(i) if it is then in material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder; or

 

(ii) prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in accordance with,
and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 6.3(c), in order to
accept a Superior Proposal, subject to the prior or concurrent payment of the
Termination Fee to Parent and otherwise subject to Section 8.3.

 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, the obligations of the parties shall
terminate and there shall be no liability on the part of any party with
respect thereto, except for the confidentiality provisions of Section 6.4 and
the provisions of Section 3.23, Section 4.11, Section 6.7, this Section 8.2,
Section 8.3 and Article IX, each of which shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and remain in full force and effect; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, nothing contained herein shall relieve any party from liability for
damages arising out of any Willful Breach of this Agreement occurring prior to
such termination, in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all
rights and remedies available at law or equity. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent expressly acknowledges and
agrees that Parents and Merger Subs obligations to hold the Closing and
consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
not conditioned in any manner upon Parent or Merger Sub obtaining any
financing. The parties acknowledge and agree that any failure by a party to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (regardless of whether, in the case of Parent, Parent has obtained
or received any proceeds of any financing) on or prior to the third Business
Day (unless another date has been agreed by the parties) after the applicable
conditions to Closing set forth in Article VII have been satisfied or waived
(except for those conditions that by their nature or terms can only be
satisfied at the Closing, which conditions were capable of being satisfied at
the time of such failure to consummate the Merger)

 



54  shall constitute a Willful Breach of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge
and agree that nothing in this Section 8.2 shall be deemed to affect their
right to specific performance under Section 9.10. In addition, the parties
agree that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 in accordance with its
terms.

 

Section 8.3 _Termination Fee_ _s_.

 

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(ii), then, on the date of termination, the Company shall pay
or cause to be paid to Parent (or its designees) an amount in cash equal to
$50,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(ii), then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later
than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause to
be paid to Parent (or its designees) the Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) (other than in
circumstances in which Parent is required to pay the Regulatory Fee pursuant
to Section 8.3(d)(iii) in respect of such termination) and an Acquisition
Proposal was publicly proposed or announced by any Person after the date of
this Agreement or a bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been communicated in
writing to the Board of Directors of the Company by any Person after the date
of this Agreement, and in either case, not withdrawn prior to such
termination;

 

(ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) and an
Acquisition Proposal was publicly proposed or announced by any Person after
the date of this Agreement and not withdrawn prior to such termination; or

(iii) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) and an Acquisition Proposal was
publicly proposed or announced by any Person after the date of this Agreement
or a bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been communicated in writing to the
Board of Directors of the Company by any Person after the date of this
Agreement, and in either case not withdrawn prior to such termination;

and, in any such event, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal with another Person or consummates any
Acquisition Proposal (which need not be the same Acquisition Proposal
described in any of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above) within twelve (12)
months after such termination of this Agreement, then, on the date the Company
enters into such definitive agreement or otherwise consummates such
Acquisition Proposal (whichever first occurs), the Company shall pay or
cause to be paid to Parent (or its designees) the Termination Fee by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Parent. For purposes of this Section 8.3(c), each reference to "20%" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to
"50%."

 



55 (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company or
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) as a result of the issuance of an Order
by any Governmental Entity or other action permanently restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the Merger under any Antitrust Law, (ii) by the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i) as a result of a breach by Parent or
Merger Sub of Section 6.5, which breach results in the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c) being incapable of being satisfied (but only,
in the case of Section 7.1(b), if the failure to meet such condition is the
result of any Antitrust Law or any Order permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Merger under any Antitrust Law); or (iii) by the
Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) (in the case of termination
by Parent, only under circumstances in which the Company has a concurrent
right to terminate pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i)) and as of the Initial
Outside Date (or if the Initial Outside Date has been extended pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(i), then the Outside Date) (A) one or more of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c) has not been satisfied (but
only, in the case of Section 7.1(b), if the failure to meet such condition is
the result of any Antitrust Law or any Order arising under any Antitrust Law)
and (B) all of the other conditions set forth in Article VII have been
satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their nature or
terms can only be satisfied at the Closing, if such conditions were capable of
being satisfied at the time of such termination), Parent shall, within two (2)
Business Days following the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid
to the Company (or its designees) an amount in cash equal to $50,000,000 (the
" _Regulatory Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by the Company. 

(e) The parties agree and understand that in no event shall either the Company
be required to pay the Termination Fee or Parent be required to pay the
Regulatory Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if Parent actually receives
the Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to this Section 8.3, such
payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub
against the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective former, current
or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members,
Affiliates and Representatives and none of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(ii) if the Company actually receives the Regulatory Fee from Parent pursuant
to this Section 8.3, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Company against Parent and its Subsidiaries and their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers,
members, Affiliates and Representatives and none of Parent, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 8.3(e) shall relieve the
Company or Parent, as applicable, from any liabilities or damages resulting
from any Willful Breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.3 do not
constitute a penalty.

 



56 Section 8.4 _Procedure for Termination_. Termination of this Agreement prior
to the Effective Time shall not require the approval of the stockholders of
the Company. A terminating party shall provide written notice of termination
to the other parties specifying the Section or Sections pursuant to which such
party is terminating the Agreement. If more than one provision in Section 8.1
is available to a terminating party in connection with a termination, a
terminating party may rely on any or all available provisions in Section 8.1
for any termination.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section, clause, Annex,
Exhibit or Section of a disclosure letter, such reference shall be to a
Section or clause of or Annex or Exhibit or Section of a disclosure letter to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The phrase
"the date of this Agreement" and terms of similar import, shall be deemed to
refer to the date first written above. Whenever the content of this Agreement
permits, the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders,
and a reference to singular or plural shall be interchangeable with the other.

 

(b) References to any agreement or contract are to that agreement or contract
as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the
terms hereof and thereof. References to any Person include the successors and
permitted assigns of that Person. References to any statute are to that
statute, as amended from time to time, and to the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. References to "$" and "dollars" are to
the currency of the United States. References from or through any date mean,
unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and including,
respectively. The words "hereby," "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words
of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole (including any disclosure
letters delivered herewith) and not merely to the specific Section, paragraph
or clause in which such word appears. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation."

 

(c) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement.

 



58 (d) No summary of this Agreement or any Exhibit attached hereto or Section of
a disclosure letter delivered herewith prepared by or on behalf of any party
shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any such
Exhibit or Section of a disclosure letter.

 

(e) Subject to the introductory language to Article III and Article IV, each
party to this Agreement has or may have set forth information in its
respective disclosure letter in a Section of such disclosure letter that
corresponds to the Section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in a disclosure letter to this
Agreement shall not constitute an admission by such party that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item would have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material
Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or that the disclosure thereof be
construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement.

Section 9.4  _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, including by facsimile or by email with .pdf
attachments, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party has received counterparts thereof signed and
delivered (by electronic communication, facsimile or otherwise) by all of the
other parties hereto.

 

Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure
Letter, the Exhibits attached hereto and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and
oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
Each party hereto agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement, neither Parent and Merger Sub nor the Company
makes any other representations or warranties, and each hereby disclaims any
other representations or warranties, express or implied, as to the accuracy
or completeness of any other information made by, or made available by, itself
or any of its Representatives, with respect to, or in connection with, the
negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to the other
or the others Representatives of any documentation or other information with
respect to any one or more of the foregoing.

 

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party except for: (i) only following the Effective Time, the provisions
of Article II shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, holders of
Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company RSU Awards and Company PSU
Awards, to the extent necessary to receive the consideration due to such
Persons thereunder; (ii) the right of the Company on behalf of its
stockholders to pursue damages (including claims for damages based on loss of
the economic benefits of the transaction to the Companys stockholders) in the
event of any breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub in respect of
which the Company is entitled to bring a claim

 



59  hereunder, which right is hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by Parent
and Merger Sub; and (iii) the provisions of Section 6.8 shall inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties. The third-party
beneficiary rights referenced in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence may be
exercised only by the Company (on behalf of its stockholders as their agent)
through actions expressly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company,
and no stockholder of the Company, whether purporting to act in its capacity
as a stockholder or purporting to assert any right (derivatively or otherwise)
on behalf of the Company, shall have any right or ability to exercise or
cause the exercise of any such right and it is understood that the rights
granted to stockholders under such clause (ii) shall attach to the shares of
Company Common Stock and subsequently trade and transfer therewith,
and, consequently, any damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or
received by the Company with respect to such rights may in the Companys sole
discretion be (A) distributed in whole or in part by the Company to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock of record as of any date determined
by the Company or (B) retained by the Company for the use and benefit of the
Company on behalf of its stockholders in any manner the Company deems fit.

 

(c) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties and are for the sole benefit of the parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the parties in accordance with Section 9.9 without notice or liability to
any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the
parties. Consequently, Persons other than the parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 

Section 9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
upon such determination that any term or other provision hereof is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 9.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties,
in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the
prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

 

Section 9.8 _Modification or Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties (with respect to the Company and Merger Sub, by action taken by their
respective Boards of Directors), at any time before or after adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the

 



60  Company, but, after any such adoption, no amendment shall be made which by
Law would require the further approval by such stockholders without first
obtaining such approval. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
may be modified or amended solely by written agreement executed and delivered
by duly authorized officers of the respective parties.

 

Section 9.9 _Extension; Waiver_. The conditions to each of the parties
obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party
and may be waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may (in
the case of the Company, by action taken or authorized by its Board of
Directors or authorized officers of the Company), to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial
exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other
rights under this Agreement.

 

Section 9.10 _Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Specific
Performance_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, shall be deemed to be made in and in all respects shall
be interpreted, construed and governed by and enforced in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of laws rules
thereof.

 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY DISPUTE WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii)
EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER,
(iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.10.

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable harm would occur for
which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by any

 



61  other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the
non-breaching party shall be entitled to (in addition to any other remedy
that may be available to it at law and in equity, including monetary damages)
(i) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach and (ii) an
Order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of
such covenant or obligation (including the obligation of the parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the obligation
of Parent and Merger Sub to pay, and the Companys equity holders right to
receive, the aggregate consideration payable to them pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case in accordance with
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement) without proof of actual
damages, and each party further agrees to waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond or other security in connection with such
remedy. Each party hereto agrees not to raise any objections (including any
defense or counterclaim that there is an adequate remedy at law) to
the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent
or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of such party under this Agreement all in
accordance with the terms of this Section 9.10(c). Each party further agrees
that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 9.10(c), a party
shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that
may be available to such party at law or in equity in respect of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) nothing set forth
in this Section 9.10(c) shall require any party to institute any suit, action
or proceeding (or limit any partys right to institute any suit, action or
proceeding) for specific performance under this Section 9.10(c) prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under Article VIII, nor shall
the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding pursuant to this Section
9.10(c) or anything set forth in this Section 9.10(c) restrict or limit any
partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
Article VIII or pursue any other remedies (including monetary damages) in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby that may be
available then or thereafter, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 

(d) Each of the parties (i) irrevocably submits itself to the personal
jurisdiction of each state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware,
as well as to the jurisdiction of all courts to which an appeal may be taken
from such courts, in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including, without limitation, any proceeding seeking equitable relief
pursuant to Section 9.10(c)); (ii) agrees that every such suit, action or
proceeding shall be brought, heard and determined exclusively in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware); (iii) agrees that it shall not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from such court; (iv) agrees not to bring any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby in any other court; and (v) waives any defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any suit, action or proceeding so
brought. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this Section 9.10(d) in
any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or
certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to
its address as specified in or pursuant to this Article IX;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect
service of process on the other party by any other legally available method.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in
any suit, action or proceeding in such court as provided above shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law.

 



62 Section 9.11 _Obligation of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to
cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be

recover monetary damages from, any past, present or future director, officer
or employee of another party.
