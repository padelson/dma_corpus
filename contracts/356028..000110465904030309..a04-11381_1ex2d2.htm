 **Exhibit 2.2**

  



  

 **STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT**

  



  

STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT, dated as of October 6, 2004 (this "Agreement"), among
the stockholder set forth on the signature page hereto (the
"Stockholder"), Computer Associates International, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Buyer"), and Nova Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation
and wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the "Transitory Subsidiary").
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
respective meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement referred to
below.

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Buyer,
Transitory Subsidiary and Netegrity, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions thereof, Transitory Subsidiary will be merged
with and into the Company, and the Company will be the surviving corporation
(the "Merger"); and

  



  

WHEREAS, for the purpose of inducing the Buyer to enter into (and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by) the Merger Agreement, the Buyer
has required that the Stockholder agree, and the Stockholder is willing, to
enter into this Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby
agree as follows:

  



  

Section 1. _Number of Shares Beneficially Owned_.

  



  

(a) The Stockholder represents and warrants that, as of the date of this
Agreement, the Stockholder (A) has full and exclusive power to vote and
direct the voting of, and to dispose of and direct the disposition of, the
shares of Company Common Stock shown on the signature page hereto (the
"Shares") and (B) beneficially owns Company Stock Options to purchase shares
of Common Company Stock shown on the signature page hereto (the "Options").
Except for the Shares and the Options and as otherwise disclosed on the
signature page hereto, neither Stockholder nor any of its Affiliates holds or
beneficially owns, as of the date hereof, any (i) shares of capital stock or
voting securities of the Company, (ii) securities of the Company convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of the
Company or (iii) options or other rights to acquire from the Company any
capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of the Company.

  



  

Section 2. _Voting of Subject Shares_.

  



  

(a) The Stockholder covenants and agrees that, until the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, at the Company Meeting or any
other meeting of the stockholders of the Company, however called, and at
every adjournment or postponement thereof, and in connection with any action
by written consent of the stockholders of the Company, such Stockholder will
vote, or cause to be voted, all of his, her or its Subject Shares (a) in
favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement, as the Merger Agreement may be
modified or amended from time to time in a manner not adverse to the
Stockholder (regardless of whether the Company recommends to its stockholders
the adoption of the Merger Agreement), and (b) except

  

      
   



  

with the express written consent of the Buyer, against (i) any Acquisition
Proposal and (ii) any action the consummation of which would frustrate the
purposes, or prevent or delay the consummation, of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Subject Shares" shall mean (i) the Shares and (ii) any other shares of
Company Common Stock of which the Stockholder or its Affiliates is or becomes
the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) during
the Term, whether by way of purchase or through the conversion, exercise or
exchange, as the case may be, of any Company Stock Options or any other
options, rights or securities held by the Stockholder or any of
its Affiliates that are convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable
for, shares of Company Common Stock.

  



  

(b) The Stockholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies with respect
to the Subject Shares. The Stockholder hereby irrevocably (to the fullest
extent permitted by law) grants to, and appoints, the Buyer, and any
individual designated in writing by the Buyer, and each of them individually,
as its proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and
in its name, place and stead, to vote or express consent on any matter
specified in, and in accordance with, subsection (a) above. The Stockholder
may vote the Subject Shares on all matters other than those specified in
subsection (a) above. The Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable
proxy set forth in this Section 2(b) is given in connection with the
execution of the Merger Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is
given to secure the performance of the duties of the Stockholder under
this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided for herein, the Stockholder
hereby (i) affirms that the irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest and
may under no circumstances be revoked, (ii) ratifies and confirms all that
the proxies appointed hereunder may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue
hereof and (iii) affirms that such irrevocable proxy is executed and intended
to be irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of Section 212(e) of the
Delaware General Corporation Law. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Agreement, the irrevocable proxy granted hereunder shall
automatically terminate upon the termination of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3. _Transfer of Subject Shares_.

  



  

(a) The Stockholder covenants and agrees that he, she or it will not, and
will not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly (including,
without limitation, through the disposition or transfer of any equity
interest in another person), (i) sell, assign, transfer (including by merger,
testamentary disposition, interspousal disposition pursuant to a domestic
relations proceeding or otherwise by operation of law), pledge, grant any
option with respect to, encumber or otherwise dispose of (collectively,
"Transfer") or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with
respect to a Transfer of, any Subject Shares or any interest therein or
securities convertible there into or any voting rights with respect thereto,
other than (A) pursuant to the Merger, (B) to any Affiliate or family member
of the Stockholder if such transferee prior to any such Transfer executes a
binding agreement with the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary substantially
in the form of this Agreement or (C) with the Buyers prior written consent
or (ii) grant any proxies with respect to the Subject Shares other than
pursuant to this Agreement or to the Buyer or its designees, or (iii) enter
into any voting trust or other agreement, arrangement or understanding with
respect to the voting of any Subject Shares.

  



  

(b) The Stockholder agrees to submit to the Company promptly following
execution of this Agreement all certificates representing the Shares so that
the Company may

  



  

2      
   



  

place thereon a conspicuous legend referring to the transfer restrictions set
forth in this Agreement and shall submit all other certificates of Company
Common Stock received after the date of this Agreement to the Company for
such purpose.

  



  

Section 4. _Other Covenants_.

  



  

(a) The Stockholder agrees to cooperate on a commercially reasonable basis
with the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the Company in (i) preparing
and filing documentation, (ii) effecting applications, notices, petitions,
filings and other documents and (iii) obtaining permits, consents, orders,
approvals and authorizations necessary to make effective the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

  



  

(b) Stockholder shall not directly or indirectly take any action that is
prohibited to be taken by any officer or director of the Company under
Section 6.1 of the Merger Agreement (whether or not such Stockholder is or
remains an officer or director, as applicable, of the Company) and shall use
his, her or its reasonable best efforts to cause his, her or its employees,
attorneys and any other of his, her or its representatives not to take any
such action. Stockholder will promptly advise (within 24 hours) the Buyer
after receipt by such Stockholder of an Acquisition Proposal, or any request
for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal, or of any inquiry with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal. Stockholder shall provide such notice in writing in
accordance with Section 9.2 of the Merger Agreement and shall identify the
third party making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the
material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.
Stockholder shall keep the Buyer reasonably informed of the status and the
material terms and conditions (including any amendment thereto) of any such
request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

  



  

(c) Stockholder agrees not to exercise any rights (including, without
limitation, under Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware) to demand appraisal of any Subject Shares which may arise with
respect to the Merger.

  



  

Section 5. _Representations and Warranties of the Stockholder_.

  



  

(a) The Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to the Buyer as follows:
(i) the Stockholder beneficially owns all of the Shares as set forth on the
signature page of this Agreement, free and clear of any claims, liens,
security interests, rights to purchase or acquire, charges or other
encumbrances and any voting agreements or restrictions with respect to
voting, other than any of the foregoing created by or arising out of this
Agreement; (ii) the Stockholder has the legal capacity and all requisite
power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this
Agreement; and (iii) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
agreement of the Stockholder, enforceable against the Stockholder in
accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting the
rights of creditors generally and the effect of general principles of equity.

  



  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Stockholder do not,
and the performance of this Agreement by the Stockholder will not, (i)
conflict with or violate any organizational documents of the Stockholder, if
any, (ii) conflict with or violate any contract,

  



  

3      
   



  

agreement, license, instrument or permit to which the Stockholder is a party
or by which the Stockholder or any of its properties or assets are bound or
affected, (iii) conflict with or violate any law applicable to
the Stockholder or by which the Stockholder or any of its properties or
assets is bound or affected, except for any such conflicts or violations as
could not reasonably be expected to impair the Stockholders ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or (iv) require any consent,
approval or notice under any law applicable to the Stockholder or by which
any of its properties or assets is bound or affected. If the Stockholder is a
natural person, is married and the Shares set forth on the signature page
hereto underneath such Stockholders name constitute community property
under applicable laws, this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed
and delivered by, and constitutes the valid and binding agreement of,
such Stockholders spouse.

  



  

Section 6. _Acknowledgement_. Nothing withstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, nothing herein shall be interpreted as obligating the
Stockholder to (i) exercise any options to acquire shares of capital stock of
the Company, (ii) convert or exchange any securities of the Company
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting
securities of the Company or (iii) exercise any other rights to acquire from
the Company any capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of the Company.

  



  

Section 7 _Termination_. This Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and
terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the
termination of the Merger Agreement.

  



  

Section 8. _Specific Performance; Cumulative Remedies_. The Stockholder
agrees that its failure to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder
will cause irreparable injury to the Buyer for which damages, even if
available, may not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the Stockholder agrees
that the Buyer may seek the issuance of injunctive relief (including a
temporary restraining order) to compel performance of its obligations and may
seek the granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of its
obligations hereunder. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

Section 9. _Fiduciary Duties_. The Stockholder is signing this Agreement
solely in the Stockholders capacity as an owner of his, her or its Subject
Shares, and nothing herein shall prohibit, prevent or preclude the
Stockholder from the exercise of such Stockholders fiduciary duties as an
officer or director of the Company.

  



  

Section 10. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between the parties with respect thereto. This Agreement may not be amended,
modified or rescinded except by an instrument in writing signed by each of
the parties hereto.

  



  

4      
   



  

(b) _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in order that the
terms of this Agreement remain as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  



  

(c) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

  



  

(d) _Jurisdiction; Waivers of Certain Defenses; Waiver of Right to Jury
Trial_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (i) consents to submit itself
to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in
Wilmington, Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in any such court, (iii) agrees that it shall not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, and (iv) agrees not to bring any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any other court. Each of
the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any
bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with
respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by
sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the
address set forth beneath such partys name on the signature page hereto.
Nothing in this Section 10(d), however, shall affect the right of any party
to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. EACH OF THE
UNDERSIGNED HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT

  



  

(e) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

  



  

(f) _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed duly delivered (i) three business days after
being sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid, or (ii) one business day after being sent for next business day
