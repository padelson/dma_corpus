necessary, unrestricted cash available to it under credit facilities in place
on the date hereof, sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser has
delivered to Sellers true, correct and complete copies of an executed debt
commitment letter and each executed fee letter and engagement letter
associated therewith ( _provided_ , that provisions in the fee or engagement
letter related solely to fees and economic terms (other than
covenants) agreed to by the parties may be redacted), dated as of the date
hereof (such commitment letter(s), including all exhibits, schedules, annexes,
supplements and amendments thereto and each such fee letter and engagement
letter, collectively, the "Debt Commitment Letter"), from Royal Bank of
Canada and Jeffries Finance LLC (the "Debt Financing Source") providing the
terms and conditions upon which the Debt Financing Source has committed to
provide up to six hundred fifteen million dollars ($615,000,000) (the "Debt
Financing Proceeds") of debt financing (the "Debt Financing"). The Debt
Commitment Letter in the form so delivered is valid and in full force and
effect with respect to Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of the Purchaser, each
other party thereto, such commitments have not been withdrawn, terminated or
otherwise amended or modified in any respect, and no event has occurred that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Purchaser under any term or condition of the Debt
Commitment Letter. The Debt Commitment Letter (together with the fee letter
referred to therein) constitutes the entire and complete agreement between
the parties thereto with respect to the financings contemplated thereby, and,
except as set forth, described or provided for in the Debt Commitment Letter,

Debt Financing Source to provide the Debt Financing, and (ii) there are no
contractual contingencies or other provisions under any agreement (including
any side letters) relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

Debt Financing Source to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing
Proceeds available under the Debt Financing or impose any additional
conditions precedent to the availability of the Debt Financing. Purchaser has
fully paid any and all commitment fees, if any, or other fees required by the
Debt Commitment Letter to be paid as of the date hereof. As of the date
hereof, Purchaser has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Debt Financing will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the funding
contemplated in the Debt Financing will not be made available to Purchaser on
a timely basis in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Debt Financing Proceeds available under the Debt Financing are
sufficient to pay the Purchase Price and all of Purchasers and its
Affiliates fees and expenses associated with the transaction contemplated in
this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof. The obligations of
Purchaser under this Agreement are not contingent on the availability of
financing.

equity, or any arbitration by, before or against any Governmental Entity or
any other Person pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Purchaser, threatened in
writing, against or affecting Purchaser, or any of its properties or rights,
which if determined adversely would reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or impair Purchasers ability
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser is
not subject to any Order which seeks to or would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or impair
Purchasers ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

brokers fees, finders fees or commissions from any Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

which investigation, review and analysis was conducted by Purchaser and its
Affiliates and, to the extent Purchaser deemed appropriate, by Purchasers
Representatives. Purchaser acknowledges that it and its Representatives have
been provided adequate access to the personnel, properties, premises and
records of the Businesses. Purchaser acknowledges that the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement are exclusive of any other
representations and warranties, express or implied, and that no Seller nor

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(b) (i) All Returns, including any amendments thereto, for Taxes and Tax

not imposed on the Purchased Companies (to the extent such Tax items are
reflected on or affect the amounts reported on the Returns of the Purchased
Companies) for any tax period ending on or before the Closing Date (including
any tax period ending on the Closing Date as a result of a technical
termination) ("Flow-Through Returns") shall be prepared and filed in the sole
discretion of Sellers; _provided_ , _however_ , Sellers shall: (A) prepare
such Flow-Through Returns in a manner consistent with past practice unless
otherwise required by law, and (B) not change any tax election nor make any

purposes of this Agreement to determine the allocation of Taxes among a
Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by
income, receipts, payroll or sales of the Purchased Companies will be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date and the amount of other Taxes of the Purchased
Companies for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Period will
be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such Straddle Period.

furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Purchased
Companies (including access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary

pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.7(d)_ shall be borne by the party
requesting it.

with respect to any Pre-Closing Period without the prior consent of Sellers,

any of its respective Representatives shall have access to the Returns or
related workpapers of Sellers or any of their Affiliates.

provide services to the Purchased Companies in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in the Transition Services Agreement, it being
acknowledged and agreed by Purchaser that Sellers and their Affiliates cannot

effect and in all material respects the Debt Commitment Letter in the form
provided to Sellers concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, (ii)
satisfying on a timely basis all of the conditions precedent and covenants to
the Debt Financing applicable to Purchaser that are to be satisfied by
Purchaser, (iii) negotiating, executing and delivering definitive
documents ("Debt Financing Documents") that reflect in all material respects
the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, as necessary,
agreeing to any requested changes to the commitments thereunder in accordance
with any "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or any
related fee letter), in each case which terms shall not in any material
respect expand on the conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing Proceeds
at the Closing or reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing Proceeds
available to be funded on the Closing Date, (iv) drawing such amount of the
Debt Financing Proceeds as is necessary to satisfy Purchasers obligations
under this Agreement and (v) fully enforcing its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing Documents in order to consummate the
Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing. Without the prior written consent
of Sellers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), Purchaser shall not permit or consent to any amendment, supplement
or modification to be made to the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment,
supplement or modification imposes new or additional conditions to the
initial funding or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions
to the receipt of the Debt Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies
any other provision of the Debt Commitment Letter, in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent or make less likely the
funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt
Financing) on the Closing Date, _provided_ that Purchaser may (1) amend the
Debt Commitment Letter to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities, (2) implement or exercise
the "flex" provisions contained in one or more fee letters related to the Debt
Financing and (3) reduce the Debt Financing on a dollar for dollar basis upon
receipt of the proceeds of an offering of debt or equity securities (an
"Equity Issuance") on or after the date hereof. Purchaser acknowledges and

not received the Debt Financing Proceeds shall constitute a material breach

notify Sellers of the receipt by Purchaser of any written notice or other
written communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any
actual, threatened or alleged material breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing
Document or any material provision of the Debt Financing contemplated pursuant
to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Documents, _provided_ that
in no event will Purchaser be under any obligation to disclose any
information shared among Purchaser and its professional advisors in connection
with matters contemplated by this sentence that is subject to attorney-client
or similar legal privilege. Purchaser shall promptly provide Sellers, upon
reasonable request, with copies of any Debt Financing Documents and such other
information and documentation regarding the Debt Financing as shall be
reasonably necessary to allow Sellers to monitor the progress of such
financing activities. Upon request, Purchaser shall provide Sellers with
written updates concerning the status of any Equity Issuance, including
whether DHX intends to proceed with an Equity Issuance to raise part of the
Purchase Price.

(b) In the event of any notification or communication that the Debt
Financing will not be available to Purchaser in accordance with the terms
hereof, Purchaser shall use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange for and obtain as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of any such Financing Failure Event alternative debt financing (the
"Alternative Financing") on commercially reasonable terms, whether or not such
terms are more or less favorable to Purchaser than the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter, in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and perform all of their obligations hereunder, it being
understood and agreed that if Purchaser proceeds with any
Alternative Financing, Purchaser shall be subject to the same obligations
with respect to such Alternative Financing as set forth in this Agreement with
respect to the Debt Financing. In the event that Alternative Financing is
obtained, Purchaser shall promptly provide Sellers with a copy of the new
financing commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing (the
"Alternative Financing Commitment Letter"). If applicable, any reference in
this Agreement to "Debt Financing" shall include "Alternative Financing", any
reference to "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include the "Alternative Financing
Commitment Letter" and any references to "Debt Financing Documents" shall
include the definitive documentation relating to any such Alternative
Financing.

(c) From the date hereof and ending at the earlier of (i) the Closing Date
and (ii) termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1,_
Sellers shall cooperate and cause its officers, employees and advisors,
including legal and accounting, to provide to Purchaser, at Purchasers sole
expense, such reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser; _provided_ that
Sellers shall not be required to provide cooperation under this _Section_ __
_ 6.11(c)_ that: (w) unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business of
Sellers or any of the Purchased Companies; (x) causes any representation or
warranty in this Agreement to be breached; (y) causes any closing condition
set forth in _Article VII_ to fail to be satisfied or otherwise causes the
breach of this Agreement or any Contract to which any Seller or any of the
Purchased Companies is a party; or (z) requires Sellers or any of their
respective directors, officers, managers or employees to execute, deliver or
enter into, or perform any agreement, document or instrument, including any
Debt Financing Document, with respect to the Debt Financing that is
not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the
Closing and the directors and managers of Sellers shall not be required to
adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and instruments pursuant
to which the Debt Financing is obtained, in each case which are effective
prior to the Closing. In no event shall Sellers be in breach of this Agreement
because of the failure to deliver any financial or other information that is
not currently readily available to Sellers on the date hereof or is not
otherwise prepared in the ordinary course of business of Sellers at the time
requested by Purchaser or for the failure to obtain review of any financial or
other information by its accountants.

the executed Termination Notice and Re-Grant Agreement to Purchaser, Sellers
shall have no further obligations with respect to the Copyright Termination

certain domain name registrations used in connection with the Businesses may

Purchased Companies prior to the Closing; unless none of the Purchased
Companies may contractually or lawfully take possession of such domain name
registrations, in which case the parties shall use commercially reasonable

8.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Following the Closing, Purchaser
shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and each of their Representatives
and Affiliates (including the Purchased Companies prior to Closing)
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Persons") for, and shall pay to the

resulting from (a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by

obligation to be performed and complied with prior to the Closing Date, other
than those in _Sections_ __ _ 4.1_, _4.2(a)_ ,  _4.3_ , _4.4_ , and _4.12_
(the "Fundamental Reps"), or _Sections_ __ _ 4.7_, _4.13_ or _4.19_ (the

notifies Sellers in writing of a claim. A claim with respect to the
Fundamental Reps may be made by Purchaser at any time [***]. A claim with
respect to the Designated Reps may be made by Purchaser at any time [***]. If
the Closing occurs, Purchaser will not be liable (for indemnification or
otherwise) with respect to any representation or warranty, or covenant or
obligation to be performed and complied with prior to the Closing Date,
unless, [***], a Seller notifies Purchaser in writing of a claim. All claims
shall specify the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the
extent then known by such party initiating the claim. Each of the covenants
and agreements of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement shall expire on the
Closing Date;  _provided_ that the covenants and agreements contained herein

their terms.

 

8.5 _Limitations on Amount_.

 

(a) In no event shall either party have the right to loss of profits or
consequential, incidental, special or punitive damages of any kind
whatsoever.

(b) Sellers shall have no liability with respect to claims for
indemnification by the Purchaser Indemnified Persons, and Purchaser shall
have no liability with respect to claims for indemnification by the Seller
Indemnified Persons, until (and only to the extent that) the total of all

and/or under the Strawberry Shortcake Transaction Agreement, in the aggregate,
exceed an amount equal to [***] (the "Basket"), which amount shall be treated
as a deductible for purposes of this  _Article VIII_.

Indemnified Persons, as the case may be, be entitled to recover Damages from
the other in excess of an amount equal to [***] in the aggregate with respect
to claims for indemnification under this Agreement and/or under the Strawberry
Shortcake Transaction Agreement (the "Cap"), _provided_ that the Cap shall be
reduced from time to time to reflect payments for indemnification for which
the Cap applies.

\- 40 - (d) The Purchaser Indemnified Persons right to indemnification shall be
reduced to the extent that the subject matter of any claim is covered by and
payable pursuant to any insurance policy, warranty or indemnification from a
Third Party.

 

(e) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with
respect to (i) any representation, warranty, covenant or condition
specifically waived in writing by the other party on or prior to the Closing
or (ii) any Damages with respect to any matter if and to the extent such
matter was included in the calculation of the Working Capital Adjustment
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2_.

(f) Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 10.10_, and except with respect to any
claim for fraud, the remedies provided in this _Article VIII_ shall be
exclusive and shall preclude other remedies that may be available to Sellers,
Purchaser, the Seller Indemnified Persons or the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ to the
contrary, neither the Basket nor the Cap shall apply to Damages arising out of
or related to (i) breaches by any Seller of any Fundamental Rep, (ii) matters
covered by  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ or _Section_ __ _
8.3(b)_ or (iii) actual fraud; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Purchaser Indemnified Persons be entitled to recover Damages from Sellers
with respect to the matters described in the immediately preceding clauses (i)
and (ii) in an aggregate amount, together with all other claims for Damages
paid or payable under this _Article VIII_ , in excess of the Purchase Price.

8.6 _Procedure for Indemnification  Third Party Claims_. 

(a) Promptly after receipt by a party indemnified under _Section_ __ _
8.1_, _8.2_ or  _8.3_ of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding against
it, by a Third Party, any indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made
against an indemnifying party under such Section, give written notice to the
indemnifying party of the commencement of such claim, but the failure to
notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party of any
liability that it may have to any indemnified party, except to the extent that
the indemnifying party demonstrates that the defense of such action is
prejudiced by the indemnified partys failure to give such notice.

(b) If any Proceeding referred to in _Section_ __ _ 8.6(a)_ is brought
against an indemnified party and it gives written notice to the indemnifying
party of the commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party may elect
to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the indemnified party (unless the indemnifying party is also a party to
such Proceeding and the indemnified party determines in good faith that joint
representation would be inappropriate under applicable standards of legal
ethics) and, after written notice from the indemnifying party to the
indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding,
the indemnifying party shall not, as long as it diligently conducts such
defense, be liable to the indemnified party under this _Article VIII_ for any
fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of
such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the indemnified party
in connection with the defense of such Proceeding. If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of a Proceeding, no compromise or settlement of such
claims may be effected by the indemnifying party without the
indemnified partys consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless (i) the compromise or settlement does
not involve any statement, finding or admission of any fault of, breach of
Contract by, or violation of Law by, the indemnified party, and (ii) the sole
relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the indemnifying
party. If written notice is given to an indemnifying party of the commencement
of any Proceeding and the indemnifying party does not, within thirty (30)
days after the indemnified partys notice is given, give written notice to the
indemnified party of its

confidentiality request. Omissions are designated as [***]. A complete version

Commission. 
---|--- 
 



\- 41 -  election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the indemnified party may
assume control of the defense of such Proceeding with counsel of its own
choosing, at the cost of the indemnifying party, and the indemnifying party
will be bound by any determination made in such Proceeding or any compromise
or settlement effected by the indemnified party. This _Section_ __ _ 8.6_
shall not apply to Tax Contests, which shall be governed by _Section_ __ _
6.7(b)_.

(c) Each party shall make available to the other all records and other
materials reasonably required to contest any claim and shall cooperate fully
with the other in the defense of all such claims. Information disclosed by one
party to the other shall be kept confidential.

 

8.7 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. The parties agree that any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless a Final
Determination with respect to the indemnitee or any of its Affiliates causes
any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for
federal income Tax purposes. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Final
Determination" shall mean (a) with respect to federal income Taxes, a
"determination" as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or execution of an
IRS Form 870-AD and, (b) with respect to Taxes other than federal income
Taxes, any final determination of liability in respect of a Tax that, under
applicable Law, is not subject to further appeal, review or modification
through a Proceeding or otherwise (including the expiration of a statute of
limitations or a period for the filing of claims for refunds, amended Tax
Returns or appeals from adverse determinations).

 

8.8 _Damages_. For purposes of determining the amount only of any Damages
in connection with this _Article VIII_ , all representations and warranties
made by Sellers or Purchaser that are qualified by "material," "Material
Adverse Change" or "Material Adverse Effect" shall be deemed to be not so
qualified.

and have no effect and there shall be no Liability hereunder on the part of
Sellers or Purchaser, except that this _Article IX_ (Termination) and _Article
X_ (Miscellaneous) shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Nothing
in this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ shall relieve or release any party to this
Agreement of any Liability or damages (which the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs, and may include to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost
(taking into consideration relevant matters, including other combination
opportunities and the time value of money) arising out of such partys
material breach of any provision of this Agreement).

 

9.3 _No Recourse to Debt Financing Source_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary and subject to and without derogation of the rights of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives under the Debt
Commitment Letter (or Alternative Financing Commitment Letter, as applicable),
or any Debt Financing Document, the Sellers and Iconix agree, on behalf of
themselves and each of their former, current or future officers, directors,
managers, employees, members, partners, stockholders, agents and other
representatives and Affiliates (the "Applicable Parties"), that the Debt
Financing Source and each of its respective former, current or future general
or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, agents, representatives
and Affiliates and each of its successors and assigns, shall be subject to
no liability or claims to the Applicable Parties in connection with financing

\- 45 -  OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES
THEREOF. THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN NEW YORK COUNTY IN THE
STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY AND ALL DISPUTES
BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE AGREEMENTS, INSTRUMENTS AND DOCUMENTS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THE PARTIES CONSENT TO AND AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT IN ANY SUCH DISPUTE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CLAIM THAT (A) SUCH PARTY IS NOT
PERSONALLY SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS, (B) SUCH PARTY AND
SUCH PARTYS PROPERTY IS IMMUNE FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS ISSUED BY SUCH COURTS
OR (C) ANY LITIGATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING COMMENCED IN SUCH COURTS IS BROUGHT
IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE THAT MAILING OF PROCESS OR
OTHER PAPERS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN THE MANNER
PROVIDED IN _SECTION_ __ _ 10.3_, OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE PERMITTED
BY LAW, SHALL BE VALID AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE THEREOF AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY
OBJECTIONS TO SERVICE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE MANNER HEREIN PROVIDED.

 

10.9 _Severability_. If any term, provision, agreement, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, agreements, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated so long as the economic and legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a determination, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a reasonably
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

10.10 _Specific Enforcement; Limitation on Damages_. The parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached or threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages would
be inadequate in such event. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the parties
and the third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be entitled to
equitable relief, without proof of actual damages, including an Order for
specific performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including any Order
sought by the Company and/or Sellers to cause Purchaser to perform its
agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement), in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity as a remedy for
any such breach or threatened breach. Each party further agrees that neither
the other party nor any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 10.10_, and each
party hereto irrevocably waives any right it may have to require
the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.
Each party further agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise
in response to any action for equitable relief is that it contests the
existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

10.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, AND SHALL CAUSE ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND
AFFILIATES TO WAIVE, ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

arising out of such Sellers ownership of the Peanuts Interests and IBG
Interests and operation of the Businesses, which such Releasor ever had, now
