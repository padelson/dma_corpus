purposes of this definition, the term "control" (including the terms
"controlling," "controlled by" and "under common control with") means the
possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction
of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of

" _After Tax Basis_ " means with respect to any payment to be actually or
constructively received by any Person, the amount of such payment (the "base
payment") supplemented by a further payment (the "additional payment") to that
Person so that the sum of the base payment plus the additional payment, after
deduction of the amount of Taxes required to be paid by such Person in respect
of the receipt or accrual of the base payment and the additional payment
(assuming for this purpose that the receipt of such payment is subject to
actual federal, state and local Taxes at a marginal effective rate reasonably
anticipated by such Person), taking into account any Tax savings actually
realized by the recipient as a result of the payment or the event giving rise
to the payment (computed using the same Tax rate assumptions as set forth in
the immediately preceding parenthetical phrase) and taking into account the
character of the income and the deductibility of any state and local Taxes for

 _Section 1.3_ _Construction_. Any reference in this Agreement to an
"Article," "Section," "Exhibit" or "Schedule" refers to the corresponding
Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule of or to this Agreement, unless the
context indicates otherwise. The table of contents and the headings of
Articles and Sections are provided for convenience only and are not intended
to affect the construction or interpretation of this Agreement. All words
used in this Agreement are to be construed to be of such gender or number as
the circumstances require. The words "including," "includes," and "include"
are to be read as listing non-exclusive examples of the matters referred to,
whether or not words such as "without limitation" or "but not limited to" are
used in each instance. Where this Agreement states that a party "shall",
"will" or "must" perform in some manner or otherwise act or omit to act, it
means that the party is legally obligated to do so in accordance with this
Agreement. Any reference to a statute is deemed also to refer to any
amendments or successor legislation as in effect at the relevant time. Any
reference to a Contract or other document as of a given date means the
Contract or other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to
time through such date. **ARTICLE 2**

 **THE TRANSACTION**

 _Section 2.1_ _Purchase and Sale of Membership Interests_. In accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Sellers will sell
and transfer to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser will purchase and acquire
from the Sellers, all of the Membership Interests.

 _Section 2.2_ _Purchase Price_.

(a) The aggregate consideration to be paid at Closing by the Purchaser to the
Sellers for the Membership Interests shall be the estimated Purchase Price, as
calculated by the Sellers in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ (the "Estimated
Purchase Price"). The Estimated Purchase Price shall be paid in cash, except
that 20% of the consideration payable to each of the Rollover Members, in each
case as set forth on the Member Allocation Schedule, shall be payable in the
Parent's common shares which will be issued subject to the restrictions in
_Section 2.6_ (the "Consideration Shares"). The number of Consideration Shares
will be calculated based on the volume weighted average price of the Parent's
common shares on the New York Stock Exchange for the 30 trading day period
ending the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date, with the number of
Consideration Shares rounded down to the nearest whole common share. In no
event will the number of Consideration Shares exceed 19.9% of the Parent's
issued and outstanding common shares as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Share Cap"). If the number of Consideration Shares would equal or exceed the
Share Cap, the Purchaser will pay to the Rollover Members in cash any amounts
over and above the Share Cap which would have otherwise been paid in
Consideration Shares.

(b) No later than three Business Days prior to the Closing, the Seller
Representative will deliver to the Purchaser a written statement (the
"Estimated Purchase Price Calculation Statement") setting forth the Company's
good faith estimate of the Estimated Purchase Price, which shall set forth, in
reasonable detail, its calculations of (i) the Company's good faith estimate
of the Closing Net Working Capital and the amount (if any) by which Closing
Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Closing Net Working Capital or the
amount (if any) by which Target Closing Net Working Capital exceeds Closing
Net Working Capital, (ii) the Company's good faith estimate of the amount of
the Closing Indebtedness, (iii) the Company's good faith estimate of the
amount of the Closing Cash, (iv) any unpaid Transaction Expenses, and (v) the
actual amount of Employee Closing Payments as of Closing. The Estimated
Purchase Price Calculation Statement shall be prepared consistent with the
Accounting Principles. The Seller Representative shall provide the Purchaser
with the opportunity to review and provide comments to the Estimated Purchase
Price Calculation Statement, which the Seller Representative shall consider in
good faith but shall be under no obligation to incorporate such comments. The
number of Membership Interests to be conveyed by each Seller, the account and
wire transfer instruction for each Seller and the number of Consideration
Shares to be paid to each Rollover Member shall be as set forth in the
Estimated Purchase Price Calculation Statement.

(c) No later than three Business Days prior to the Closing, the Seller
Representative will deliver to the Purchaser the Member Allocation Schedule.

 _Section 2.3_ _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

(a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will prepare and
deliver to the Seller Representative an unaudited consolidated balance sheet
of the Company as of the close of business on the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and a written statement (together
with the Closing Balance Sheet, the "Closing Statement") setting forth the
Purchaser's calculations (the "Purchaser's Proposed Calculations") of the
Purchase Price (the "Final Purchase Price"), which shall set forth, in
reasonable detail its calculations of: (i) the Closing Net Working Capital and
the amount (if any) by which Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the Target
Closing Net Working Capital and the ​

amount (if any) by which the Target Closing Net Working Capital exceeds
Closing Net Working Capital; (ii) the Closing Indebtedness, (iii) the Closing
Cash and (iv) any unpaid Transaction Expenses. The Closing Balance Sheet and
the Purchaser's Proposed Calculations will be prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles, without giving effect to any purchase accounting
adjustments or other changes arising from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(b) If the Seller Representative has any objections to the Closing Statement
and the calculation of the Purchase Price, the Seller Representative must
deliver to the Purchaser a written statement (an "Objections Statement")
setting forth a description in reasonable detail of its objections thereto,
including the basis for the objection, proposed adjustment amount and
supporting calculations. If an Objections Statement is not delivered to the
Purchaser within 30 days after delivery of the Closing Statement, the Closing
Statement and the Purchaser's calculation of the Purchase Price will be final,
binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto.

(c) If the Seller Representative timely delivers an Objections Statement to
the Purchaser, then the Purchaser and the Seller Representative will negotiate
in good faith to resolve any objections set forth in the Objections Statement,
but if they are unable to resolve all disputed items by the end of 30 days
after the date of delivery of the Objections Statement, then the remaining
items in dispute will be submitted to Deloitte and Touche for resolution acting
as an accounting expert and not as an arbitrator, or if that firm is unwilling
or unable to serve, the Purchaser and the Seller Representative will engage
another mutually agreeable independent accounting firm of recognized national
standing, which firm is not the regular auditing firm of the Purchaser or the
Company (such selected independent accounting firm, the "Independent
Accounting Firm"). The Purchaser and the Seller Representative will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to
resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable and in any event within 30
days after the date of appointment. The Independent Accounting Firm may
address only those items and amounts which are identified in the Objections
Statement as being items which the Seller Representative and the Purchaser are
unable to resolve, and the Independent Accounting Firm's determination shall
be within the range proposed by the Purchaser and the Seller Representative.
The resolution of the dispute by the Independent Accounting Firm will be
final, binding and non-appealable on the parties. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm will be allocated between the Purchaser, on the
one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, pro rata based on their
respective share of the Purchase Price, based upon the percentage which the
portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount
actually contested by such party, as determined by the Independent Accounting
Firm, and each party shall bear its own expenses in connection therewith,
including its attorneys' and accountants' fees.

(d) For purposes of complying with this _Section 2.3_ , and subject to
executing customary access letters, the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative will furnish to each other and to the Independent Accounting
Firm such work papers and other documents and information relating to the
disputed items as the Independent Accounting Firm may reasonably request and
are available to that party (or its independent public accountants) and will
be afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Accounting Firm any
written material related to the disputed items. The party providing any such
work papers, other documents or information to the Independent Accounting Firm
shall also provide such papers, documents and information to the other party.

(e) Upon the determination, in accordance with _Section 2.3(b)_ or _Section
2.3(c)_ , as applicable, of the Closing Statement and the final calculations
of the amounts of the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Net
Working Capital and the Net Working Capital Adjustment calculated by reference
thereto, and any unpaid Transaction Expenses, the Purchase Price will be
recalculated using such finally determined amounts in lieu of the estimates of
such amounts used in the calculation of the estimated ​

Purchase Price payable at Closing as set forth on the Estimated Purchase Price
Calculation Statement as follows:

(i) If the Final Purchase Price as calculated pursuant to this _Section
2.3(e)_ is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then the Purchaser will
pay to the Sellers an amount in immediately available funds equal to any such
excess; and

(ii) If the Final Purchase Price as calculated pursuant to this _Section
2.3(e)_ is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then the Sellers will pay
to the Purchaser an amount in immediately available funds equal to any such
deficiency.

(f) The Sellers will be severally but not jointly liable for any amount for
which payment is required by the Sellers under _Section 2.3(e)_ , which
payment will be effected, first, by paying all or part of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount from the Escrow Account to an account designated by the
Purchaser, and any remaining amounts by wire transfer of immediately available
funds from the Sellers to an account designated by the Purchaser. Any payment
by the Purchaser to the Sellers pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_ will be effected
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts
designated by the Seller Representative. Such payments will be made within
five Business Days following the final determination referred to in _Section
2.3(e)_.

(g) The purpose of this _Section 2.3_ is to determine the Final Purchase Price
to be paid by the Purchaser under this Agreement. Accordingly, any adjustment
pursuant hereto will neither be deemed to be an indemnification pursuant to
_ARTICLE 10_ , nor preclude the Purchaser from exercising any indemnification
rights pursuant to _ARTICLE 10_. Any payment made pursuant to this _Section
2.3_ will be treated by the parties for all purposes as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

 _Section 2.4_ _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the purchase and sale of the Membership Interests contemplated
hereby shall take place at a closing (the "Closing") to be held at 10:00 a.m.
Pacific Time, no later than three Business Days after the last of the
conditions to Closing set forth in _ARTICLE 8_ have been satisfied or waived
(other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied on the
Closing Date) at the offices of Dorsey and Whitney LLP, 50 South Sixth Street,

(a) Upon issuance of the Consideration Shares, each Rollover Member's
Consideration Shares will be made subject to transfer and forfeiture
restrictions (the "Restrictions"), which will lapse, if at all, as described
in _Section 2.6(b)_. Until the Restrictions lapse as set forth in _Section
2.6(b)_ , the Consideration Shares will be held in trust by the Purchaser and
may not be transferred by the Rollover Member. The Rollover Members will have
the right to vote any Consideration Shares held in trust. If any dividends are
paid on Consideration Shares held in trust, the Purchaser shall hold such
dividends until the Consideration Shares upon which the dividends were paid
have been released from trust. Such dividends shall be treated as dividend
income of the Rollover Members for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the
applicable taxable year paid by Parent and reported as taxable income by the
Rollover Members on their personal U.S. federal and state income tax returns
for each such taxable year. If the Restrictions do not lapse with respect to
any Consideration Shares, the Purchaser shall pay to the Rollover Members any
dividends declared upon those Consideration Shares. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Rollover Members shall be entitled to retain any dividends so paid
even if the Consideration Shares are forfeited. Upon a Rollover Member's
termination of employment with the Purchaser or its Affiliates, any
Consideration Shares for which the Restrictions have not lapsed will be,
subject to _Section 2.6(b),_ automatically be forfeited and returned to the
Purchaser without consideration. At Closing, each Rollover Member will deliver to the Purchaser
executed stock powers in blank with respect to the Consideration Shares (the
"Stock Powers") to secure the foregoing obligation.

(b) The Restrictions will lapse for Gary McArdle as follows: (i) the
Restrictions on one-third of his Consideration Shares will lapse on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date if he is employed by the Purchaser or one its
Affiliates on that date, (ii) the Restrictions on one-third of his
Consideration Shares will lapse on the second anniversary of the Closing Date
if he is employed by the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates on that date, and
(iii) the Restrictions on one-third of his Consideration Shares will lapse on
the third anniversary of the Closing Date if he is employed by the Purchaser
or one its Affiliates on that date. The Restrictions will lapse with respect
to Phil Mause and Alex Currall, as applicable, as follows: (x) the
Restrictions on one-half of such Rollover Member's Consideration Shares will
lapse automatically on the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date if such
Rollover Member is employed by the Purchaser or one its Affiliates on that
date, and (y) the Restrictions on one-twelfth of such Rollover Member's
Consideration Shares will lapse automatically on each quarterly anniversary
thereafter if such Rollover Member is employed by the Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates on that date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) if a Rollover
Member's employment terminates due to the death or Disability (as such term is
defined in such Rollover Member's Employment Agreement) of such Rollover
Member, then the Restrictions will lapse automatically as to such Rollover
Member's Consideration Shares or if any Rollover Member's employment
terminates due to termination by the Company without Cause or termination of
the Rollover Member's employment by the Rollover Member for Good Reason (in
each case, as such terms are defined in the Rollover Members' respective
Employment Agreements), then the Restrictions will lapse automatically as to
such Rollover Member, and each Rollover Member's Consideration Shares will no
longer be subject to forfeiture, and (y) the Restrictions will lapse as to all
Consideration Shares upon a Sale of the Parent. Within three (3) Business
Days of the lapsing of any of the Rollover Members' Consideration Shares,
Parent will promptly remove any legends or instructions pertaining to the
Restrictions as to such Rollover Member's Consideration Shares and will cause
share certificates representing the Consideration Shares to be delivered from
trust to the Rollover Member. For purposes of this _Section 2.6_ , "Sale of
the Parent" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following with respect to
the Parent: (i) the direct or indirect sale or exchange in a single or series
of related transactions by the stockholders of the Parent of voting securities
of the Parent representing more than fifty percent (50%) of the Parent's then-
outstanding voting securities on an as converted basis; (ii) a merger,
consolidation or other series of related transactions to which the Parent is a
party and in which the stockholders of the Parent immediately before the
transaction do not retain immediately after the transaction direct or indirect
beneficial ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the total combined
voting power of the outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the
election of board of directors of the surviving entity; or (iii) the sale,
exchange, or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Parent
or its Subsidiaries, considered together as a whole (other than a sale,
exchange or transfer to one or more subsidiaries of the Parent).

(v) amend or waive any terms and conditions of this Agreement providing rights
or benefits to the Sellers ​

hereof and in the manner provided herein and provided that no amendment or
waiver shall be valid if it shall disproportionately affect any Seller as it
relates to any other Seller), and (vi) take any and all additional action as
is contemplated to be taken by or on behalf of the Sellers by the terms of
this Agreement. The Seller Representative shall not be responsible to any
Seller for any loss or damage any Seller may suffer by reason of the
performance by the Seller Representative of its duties under this Agreement,
other than loss or damage arising from intentional misconduct or bad faith in
the performance of such duties. The Sellers pro rata in accordance with their
respective share of the Purchase Price, shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller Representative from and against all Liabilities, losses, costs, damages
or expenses (including attorneys' and accountants' fees) incurred or suffered
by the Seller Representative arising out of or otherwise resulting from any
action taken or omitted to be taken by the Seller Representative under this
Agreement, other than such Liabilities, losses, costs, damages or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the intentional misconduct or bad faith of
the Seller Representative.

(b) The Seller Representative hereby agrees to do such acts, and execute
further documents, as shall be reasonably necessary to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement.

(c) The Seller Representative may resign at any time by giving five (5) days'
prior written notice to the Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers (at their
addresses last known to the Seller Representative), which resignation shall be
effective immediately upon the date set forth in such notice. The Sellers may
terminate the Seller Representative by a written instrument executed by all
Sellers (other than the Seller then acting as Seller Representative, if
applicable) and delivered to the Seller Representative, the Purchaser and the
Company. Upon resignation or termination of the Seller Representative, the
Seller Representative's successor, who shall serve and exercise the powers of
the Seller Representative hereunder, shall be appointed by a written
instrument signed by the Sellers representing at least 75% of the pro rata
share of the Membership Interests prior to Closing and delivered to the
Purchaser and the Company.

(d) After the Closing, any notice given to the Seller Representative will
constitute notice to all of the Sellers at the time notice is given to the
Seller Representative. After the Closing, any action taken by, or notice or
instruction received from, the Seller Representative will be deemed to be
action by, or notice or instruction from, all of the Sellers.

(e) The Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company) shall be entitled to rely on the appointment of the Seller
Representative and treat such Seller Representative as the duly appointed
attorney-in-fact of the Sellers and as having the duties, power and authority
provided for in this Agreement. None of the Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company) shall be liable to any Seller for
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them in good faith reliance
upon any instructions, notice or other instruments delivered by the Seller
Representative.

(f) The representative fund into which the Seller Representative deposited the
Representative Amount shall be held in a segregated account maintained by the
Seller Representative, and will be held by the Seller Representative on behalf
of the Sellers as a fund for the fees and expenses of the Seller
Representative incurred in connection with this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents (the "Representative Fund"). At Closing, $100,000 will be wired to
the Representative Fund in immediately available funds by the Sellers pro rata
based on their respective share of the Purchase Price. The Seller
Representative shall have the right to recover from the Representative Fund,
prior to any distribution to the Sellers, such Seller Representative's

under this Agreement ("Charges"), including costs and expenses resulting from
the employment of financial advisors, attorneys, auditors and other advisors
and agents assisting in the assessment of arbitration, litigation and
settlement of any disputes arising under this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents. Upon the final resolution of all disputes arising under this
Agreement and the ​

Transaction Documents and full reimbursement of all Charges of the Seller
Representative as provided herein, the Seller Representative shall distribute
any remaining portion of the Representative Fund to the Sellers pro rata in
accordance with their respective share of the Purchase Price. The Sellers
shall pro rata based on their respective share of the Purchase Price, be
responsible for the payment of all fees and expenses reasonably incurred by
the Seller Representative in performing his duties under this Agreement in
excess of the amounts available at such time in the Representative Fund.

the premium, together with all taxes and application, underwriting or similar
or other fees or expenses payable at or before the Closing in connection with
obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy, including those to bind the policy and to
continue coverage for so long as representations and warranties of the Company
and the Sellers shall survive under this Agreement, shall be paid by the
Purchaser. The Purchaser shall not take any actions prior to the Closing to
amend the RandW Insurance Policy in a manner that would be adverse to the
Company or the Sellers in any material respect, and shall comply in all
material respects with the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy.

this Agreement, the Rollover Members shall have entered into employment

 **ARTICLE 3**

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS**

Each Seller, severally and not jointly, and, with respect to _Section 3.1_ ,
the Company, represents and warrants to the Purchaser as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing, as follows, except as set forth on the
disclosure schedule delivered by the Sellers to the Purchaser concurrently
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and dated as of the date of
this Agreement (the "Seller Disclosure Schedule"):

 _Section 3.1_ _Organization and Good Standing_. The Company is a limited
liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the State of California and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to conduct
its business as presently conducted. The Company and the Subsidiaries are
duly qualified to do business and are in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the character of the properties they own, operate or lease or the nature
of their activities makes such qualification necessary, except to the extent
that the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Copies of the Governing Documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as currently in effect, have been delivered to the Purchaser and
are true, correct and complete copies as of the date hereof. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation of its respective Governing
Documents.

 _Section 3.2_ _Authority and Enforceability_.

(a) The Company has all requisite limited liability company power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement
and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been
duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Company. The
Company has duly and validly executed and delivered this Agreement and, on or
prior to the Closing, the Company will have duly and validly executed and
delivered each Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party. Assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties hereto or thereto,
this Agreement constitutes, and upon execution and delivery of each Ancillary
Agreement to which the Company is a party will constitute, the valid and
binding ​

obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

(b) Each Seller has all requisite power, authority and capacity to execute,
deliver and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been
duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Sellers. Each
Seller has duly and validly executed and delivered this Agreement. If the
Seller is a trust, the trust was duly created pursuant to the Laws of the
state in which it was created, which state is set forth on _Section 3.2(b)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule. The trust is valid, has not terminated and has
not been revoked and is not supervised by any court. Each of the Persons set
forth on _Section 3.2(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is a duly
appointed and acting trustee (each, a "Trustee") for the trust by which such
Person's name appears, and the Person or Persons identified as a Trustee or
Trustees for such trust constitute all of the currently acting Trustees of
such trust. Each Trustee has the requisite authority under the documents
governing the trust (each, a "Trust Instrument") to act on behalf of such
trust, and each Trustee is authorized by the applicable Trust Instrument to
execute and deliver any Ancillary Agreement to which such trust is a party,
and to consummate the transactions and to perform the obligations contemplated
thereby. No other proceedings on the part of any Trustee are necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery of any Ancillary Agreement to which the
trust is a party or the transactions contemplated thereby.

(c) Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other
parties hereto or thereto, this Agreement constitutes, and upon execution and
delivery each Ancillary Agreement to which a Seller is a party will
constitute, the valid and binding obligation of the Seller that is party
thereto, enforceable against such Seller in accordance with its terms, except
as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law). If such Seller is a trust,
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by such Seller has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by an applicable Trustee on
behalf of the trust, and assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties hereto, constitutes the legal, valid and binding
agreement of each Trustee, enforceable against such Trustee and the trust
estate of the applicable trust in accordance with their terms, except as
enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law). No beneficiary of such trust
has notified any Seller or Trustee of any objection to the action or authority
of the Trustee to execute and deliver this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, and there is no Proceeding pending in any
court having jurisdiction over any Trustee or the estate of such trust
challenging the authority of the Trustee to execute and deliver this Agreement
or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 _Section 3.3_ _No Conflict_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.3_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement by the Company or any Seller, nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, will (a)
violate in any material respect the Governing Documents of the Company, or any
resolution adopted by the board of managers or members of the Company, (b)
result in (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a breach or
default under or create in any Person the right to terminate, cancel,
accelerate or modify, or require any notice, consent or waiver under, any
Material Contract to which the Company is a party or by which the Company or
any of its material properties or assets is otherwise bound or affected, (c)
result in the imposition of any Encumbrances on any of the Membership
Interests or any of the properties or assets ​

of the Company, (d) violate in any material respect any Law, Judgment or
Governmental Authorization applicable to the Company or any of its businesses,
properties or assets, or (e) require the Company to obtain any material
Consent or Governmental Authorization or make any filing or registration with
any Governmental Authority or other Person, except as may be required under
the HSR Act.

Interests of capital equity or other equity interests of the Company or any

right, or Contract. There are no outstanding or authorized equity
appreciation, phantom equity, profit participation or similar rights with
respect to the Company. There are no Contracts to which the Company or any
Seller or any Affiliate of the Company or any Seller is a party or by which

sale or transfer (including Contracts imposing transfer restrictions) of any
Membership Interests of capital equity or other equity interests of the
Company. No holder of Indebtedness of the Company has any right to convert or

Balance Sheet or arising after the date of the Interim Balance Sheet have
arisen from bona fide transactions involving the sale of goods or the
rendering of services in the ordinary course of business. Such accounts
receivable are collectible in full, net of the respective reserves shown on
the Balance Sheet or the Interim Balance Sheet or, with respect to accounts
receivable arising after the date of the Interim Balance Sheet, on the
accounting records of the Company as of the Closing Date, as the case may be
(which reserves have been calculated consistent with the past custom and
practice of the Company). To the Sellers' Knowledge, there is no contest,
claim, defense or right of setoff, other than returns in the ordinary course
of business, relating to the amount or validity of material accounts
receivables. Except as set forth in _Section 3.8(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries hold any accounts
receivable from any of the Sellers or their Affiliates or any Person not
acting at arm's length with any of them.

(b) _Section 3.8(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate
and complete list of all bank accounts and safe deposits of the Company and
the Subsidiaries utilized in the operations since January 1, 2018 and a
listing of the Persons authorized to draw or borrow thereon or to obtain
access thereto.

 _Section 3.9_ _Liabilities_.

(a) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any Liabilities except (a)
Liabilities specifically reflected and adequately reserved against in the
Interim Balance Sheet and (b) Liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business after the date of the Balance Sheet (none of which is a liability
resulting from breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort, infringement or
misappropriation).

(b) As of the date of the Company's submission of the application for the PPP
Loan (the "PPP Loan Application"), the Company satisfied all then-existing
eligibility requirements for the PPP Loan, and all information included in the
PPP Loan Application was complete and accurate in all material respects as of
the date of its submission. The certifications made pursuant to the PPP Loan
Application were made by the Company in good faith. The Company has used 100%
of the proceeds of the PPP Loan solely for PPP Forgivable Uses. The Company
has held the proceeds of the PPP Loan in a deposit account segregated from the
Company's other deposit accounts and has not comingled such proceeds with the
cash and other assets of the Company.

 _Section 3.10_ _Absence of Certain Changes and Events_. Since the date of the
Interim Balance Sheet, there has not been any Material Adverse Effect, and
there has been no change in the condition, assets or the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries other than in the ordinary course of business,
except such changes as would not individually or in the aggregate be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as set forth in _Section 3.10_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, since the date of the Balance Sheet, there has not
been with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries any:

(a) amendment to its Governing Documents;

Membership Interests or other equity securities or any options, warrants or
other rights to acquire, any such securities;

distribution (whether in cash, securities or other property) in respect of its
Membership Interests;

(e) incurrence, assumption or guarantee of any Indebtedness;

(f) sale, lease, license, pledge or other disposition of, or Encumbrance
(other than Permitted Encumbrances) on, any of its properties or assets (other
than sales of inventory for fair consideration and in the ordinary course of
business);

(g) consummation of (i) any merger, consolidation or other business
combination, or (ii) the purchase of all or a substantial portion of the
assets or any equity of any business or Person;

(h) damage to, or destruction or loss of, any of its material assets or
material properties, whether or not covered by insurance;

(i) entry into, modification, acceleration, cancellation or termination of any
Material Contract except in the ordinary course of business;

(j) (i) adoption, entry into, termination or amendment of any Company Plan, or
employment, severance or similar Contract, (ii) increase in the compensation
or fringe benefits of, or payment of any bonus to, any manager or officer of
the Company or any Subsidiary, (iii) amendment or acceleration of the payment,
right to payment or vesting of any compensation or benefits, or (iv) grant of
any awards under any bonus, incentive, performance or other compensation plan
or arrangement or benefit plan;

(k) cancellation, compromise, release or waiver of any material claims or
rights (or series of related claims or rights) or otherwise outside the

Liabilities or in the collection of notes or accounts receivable;

under or with respect to any material Intellectual Property Rights (other than
non-exclusive licenses granted in the ordinary course of business), or any
allowance of any material Owned Intellectual Property Rights to lapse, expire,
or become subject to any Encumbrance (other than Permitted Encumbrances); or

(p) authorization or agreement, in writing or otherwise, to do any of the
foregoing.

 _Section 3.11_ _Assets_. The Company or its Subsidiaries have good and valid
title to, or in the case of leased assets, valid leasehold interests in, all
of its tangible personal property and assets, and except as set forth in
_Section 3.11_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule are free and clear of any
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. The Company and its
Subsidiaries own or lease all tangible assets used in ​

or necessary to conduct its business as conducted. Each such tangible asset
has been maintained in accordance with normal industry practice, is in good
operating condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and is
suitable and sufficient for the purposes for which it is being used.

 _Section 3.12_ _Real Property_.

(a) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary owns any real property. The real
properties demised by the leases listed on _Section 3.12_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule constitute all of the real property leased (whether or not
occupied and including any leases assigned or leased premises sublet for which
the Company or any Subsidiary remains liable), used or occupied by the Company
or any Subsidiary.

(b) The leases of real property listed on _Section 3.12_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule as being leased by the Company or any Subsidiary (the
"Leased Real Property") are in full force and effect, and the Company or a
Subsidiary holds a valid and existing leasehold interest under each of the
leases for the term listed on _Section 3.12_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule. To the Sellers' Knowledge, the Leased Real Property is subject to no
ground lease, master lease, mortgage, deed of trust or other Encumbrance or
interests that would entitle the holder thereof to interfere with or disturb
use or enjoyment of the Leased Real Property or the exercise by the lessee of
its rights under such lease so long as the lessee is not in default under such
lease.

 _Section 3.13_ _Intellectual Property, Systems, and Data Security_.

(a) _Section 3.13(a)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists and describes
all Owned Intellectual Property Rights that are Registered Intellectual
Property Rights and all material unregistered Owned Intellectual Property
Rights. _Section 3.13(a)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists all
Contracts relating to Licensed-In Intellectual Property Rights, other than
Mass-Market Software and/or Open Source software. _Section 3.13(a)(iii)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists all Contracts relating to Licensed-Out
Intellectual Property Rights and describes the Intellectual Property Rights
covered by such Contracts. _Section 3.13(a)(iv)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule lists and describes all materials otherwise protectable under
Intellectual Property Rights used in the business of the Company or any
Subsidiary as conducted or proposed to be conducted that are in the public
domain. The Owned Intellectual Property Rights and the Licensed-In
Intellectual Property Rights constitute all Intellectual Property Rights
necessary for the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as conducted or
proposed to be conducted as of the Closing Date.

(b) The Company solely owns all right, title and interest in, or has an
exclusive license to, the Owned Intellectual Property Rights free and clear of
all Encumbrances (including royalty or other payments), other than the
Permitted Encumbrances listed on Section 3.13(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule. The Company is the official and sole owner of record of all
Registered Intellectual Property Rights that are Owned Intellectual Property
Rights. To the Sellers' Knowledge, no Owned Intellectual Property Right is
currently being or has been infringed by any Person. The Company or a
Subsidiary owns all Intellectual Property Rights developed by its current and
former employees and independent contractors during the period of their
employment or within the scope of their contracting or consulting
relationship, as the case may be, with the Company or any Subsidiary. To the
extent such Intellectual Property Rights did not vest originally in the
Company or a Subsidiary by operation of law, such employees and independent
contractors have validly assigned such Intellectual Property Rights to the
Company or a Subsidiary pursuant to enforceable written agreements that have
been made available to the Purchaser. No employee or former employee or
independent contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary has any claim with
respect to any Intellectual Property Right of the Company. ​

(c) No funding, facilities, or personnel of any Governmental Authority or any
public or private university, college, or other educational or research
institution were used, directly or indirectly, to develop or create, in whole
or in part, any Owned Intellectual Property Rights.

(d) All Owned Intellectual Property Rights are valid and enforceable, and no
Person has asserted that any Owned Intellectual Property Right is invalid or
unenforceable. All Owned Intellectual Property Rights that are Registered
Intellectual Property Rights are in full force and effect, and all actions
required to keep such rights pending or in effect or to provide full available
protection, including payment of filing, examination, annuity, and maintenance
fees and filing of renewals, statements of use or working, affidavits of
incontestability and other similar actions, have been taken, and no such
Registered Intellectual Property Right is the subject of any interference,
opposition, cancellation, nullity, re-examination or other proceeding placing
in question the validity or scope of such rights. All products covered by
Owned Intellectual Property Rights or Licensed-In Intellectual Property Rights
that are Registered Intellectual Property Rights and all usages of Owned
Intellectual Property Rights or Licensed-In Intellectual Property Rights that
are Registered Intellectual Property Rights have been marked with the
appropriate patent, trademark or other marking required or desirable to
maximize available damage awards.

(e) All trade secrets listed in _Section 3.13(a)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule are documented in sufficient detail and content to allow for their
full and proper use without reliance on the knowledge or memory of any
individual. Except as set forth in Section 3.13(e) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, all reasonable precautions have been taken to protect the secrecy,
confidentiality and value of the trade secrets and all other proprietary
information used by the Company or any Subsidiary including the implementation
and enforcement of policies requiring each employee or independent contractor
who has access to trade secrets to execute proprietary information and
confidentiality agreements substantially in a standard form, and each current
and former employee and independent contractor of the Company or any
Subsidiary has executed such an agreement. There has been no breach or other
violation of such agreements. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
sufficient right to use all trade secrets and other proprietary information as
currently used in its business, subject to any Contract relating to Licensed-
In Intellectual Property Rights. No such trade secret or other proprietary
information is, to the Sellers' Knowledge, part of the public knowledge or
literature, and no such trade secret or other proprietary information has been
used, divulged or appropriated by the Company or a Subsidiary either for the
benefit of any Person other than the Company or a Subsidiary or to the
detriment of the Company or any Subsidiary.

(f) To the Sellers' Knowledge, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
taken action, or failed to take an action, that might have the effect of
estopping or otherwise limiting its right to enforce Owned Intellectual
Property Rights against any Person.

(g) Following the Closing, the Company will have the same rights in all Owned
Intellectual Property Rights that it had immediately prior to the Closing. No
Contract to which the Company or a Subsidiary is a party or is otherwise bound
will cause or require (or would purport to cause or require) the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates or the Company or any Subsidiary, on account of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to (i) grant to any other Person
any license, covenant not to sue, immunity or other right with respect to or
under any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' Intellectual Property Rights;
(ii) be obligated, in relation to its or their products, services, or
Intellectual Property Rights, to pay any royalties or other amounts or offer
any discounts to any other Person; or (iii) become bound or subject to any
non-compete or other material restrictions on the operations or scope of their
respective businesses.

(h) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(h) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any present expectation or
intention of not fully performing any obligation pursuant to any license or
any other Contract pertaining to the use or practicing of any Intellectual
Property Rights thereunder, and there is no breach, anticipated breach or
default by any other party to any license or ​

other such Contract. There are no renegotiations of, attempts to renegotiate,
demands for or outstanding rights to renegotiate any license or other such
Contract. All rights under each license and other such Contract will be fully
available to the Company or a Subsidiary after the Closing.

(i) Each Licensed-In Intellectual Property Right for which the Company or any
Subsidiary has an exclusive right is in full force and effect, all actions
required to keep such right pending or in effect or to provide full
protection, including payment of filing, examination, annuity, and maintenance
fees and filing of renewals, statements of use or working, affidavits of
incontestability and other similar actions, have been taken. No Licensed-in
Intellectual Property Right that is a Registered Intellectual Property Right
and for which the Company or any Subsidiary has an exclusive right is the
subject of any interference, opposition, cancellation, nullity, re-examination
or other proceeding placing in question the validity or scope of such right.

(j) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(j) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has (1) to the Sellers' Knowledge
infringed any third party patent, nor (2) infringed, misappropriated or
otherwise violated any other Third-Party Intellectual Property Right, and
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any notice of any
infringement, misappropriation or violation by the Company or any Subsidiary
of any Third-Party Intellectual Property Right. No infringement,
misappropriation or violation of any Third-Party Intellectual Property Right
has occurred or will occur with respect to products or services sold by the
Company or any Subsidiary or with respect to the products or services or with
respect to the conduct of the business of the Company or any Subsidiary as
conducted.

(k) All software that is used by the Company or any Subsidiary or is present
at any facility or on any equipment of the Company or any Subsidiary is owned
by the Company or a Subsidiary or is subject to a current license agreement
that covers all use of the software in the business of the Company or any
Subsidiary as conducted or as proposed to be conducted. Each of the Company
and the Subsidiaries has the right to use the software and the software- or
technology-based services (such as software-as-a-service, cloud services, and
the like) used in its business as it is being used, without any conflict with
the rights of others. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in breach of
any license to, or license of, any software, or any terms of service or other
Contract pertaining to software- or technology-based services. Following the
Closing, each of the Company and the Subsidiaries will have sufficient rights
and access to all necessary software and software- or technology-based
services, to operate its business as it is conducted or as proposed to be
conducted.

(l) _Section 3.13(l)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule identifies each of
the products and services (including but not limited to software applications
and data-as-a-service offerings) that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
currently offers or for which they currently provide technical support or
maintenance, or that they have developed and intend to release within six
months after execution of this Agreement. _Section 3.13(l)(ii)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule identifies each of the Customer Contracts and Website Data
Contracts through which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries acquires,
processes and distributes data by, for or through such products and services
as there are currently provided and proposed to be provided. The Company and
its Subsidiaries have acquired all necessary rights, consents, and
permissions, and have provided all necessary notices, for the acquisition,
processing, and distribution of data by, for, or through such products and
services as they are currently provided and proposed to be provided.

(m) The Company and its Subsidiaries have not disclosed or agreed to disclose
to any Person (other than their employees and independent contractors for
purposes of performing services for the Company or any Subsidiary) any source
code for the Company's or any Subsidiary's products or other proprietary
software, including pursuant to a source code escrow provision or agreement.
No event has ​

occurred, and no condition exists, that would reasonably be expected to
require the disclosure of any such source code, including the execution of
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(n) The Company and its Subsidiaries have not embedded, used, modified, or
distributed any Open Source Software in connection with any of their current
or in-development products or services, or any software included in the Owned
Intellectual Property Rights, in any manner that would (pursuant to the
applicable license terms) create, impose, or be subject to (i) any requirement
that any Owned Intellectual Property Rights be disclosed or distributed in
source code form or be licensed for the purpose of making derivative works;
(ii) any restriction on the consideration to be charged for the distribution
of any products, services, or software of the Company or any Subsidiary; or
(iii) any other limitation, restriction or condition on the Company's or any
Subsidiary's rights to use or distribute, or to protect its proprietary
interests in, any of the Company's or any Subsidiary's products, services, or
software. _Section 3.13(n)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists all Open
Source Software that is embedded in, distributed with, or used by or in
connection with any products, services, or software of the Company or any
Subsidiary, in each case identifying the corresponding product, service or
software of the Company or any Subsidiary and the applicable license terms.

(o) To the Sellers' Knowledge, (1) the software used by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (other than software in development) is substantially free of
any material defects, bugs and errors in accordance with generally accepted
industry standards, and (2) does not contain or make available any disabling
codes or instructions, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, viruses or other
software routines that are designed or intended to permit or cause
unauthorized access to, or disruption, impairment, disablement, or destruction
of, software, data or other materials ("Contaminants").

(p) The computer, information-technology and data-processing systems,
facilities and services used or planned to be used by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, including all software, hardware, networks, communications
facilities, platforms and related systems and services used or planned to be
used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Systems"),
are (and after the Closing will continue to be) reasonably sufficient for the
existing and currently anticipated future needs of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The Systems are in good working condition to effectively perform
all computing, information technology and data processing operations necessary
for the operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. There
have been no internal or external audits of the Company's Systems or privacy
or security practices in which material exceptions or deficiencies were noted,
except as have been resolved without Liability to or other adverse impact upon
the Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially
reasonable steps and implemented commercially reasonable safeguards to ensure
that the Systems are substantially free from Contaminants.

(q) In the twelve-month period prior to the date hereof, there has been no
failure, breakdown or continued substandard performance of any Systems that
has caused a material disruption or interruption in or to the Company's or any
Subsidiary's use of the Systems, any customer's use of the Company's or any
Subsidiary's products or services, or other material aspects of the operation
of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Company and its
Subsidiaries make back-up copies of data and information critical to the
conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with
best practices in the industry. Except as set forth in Section 3.13(q) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its Subsidiaries have in place and
operate according to information security, disaster recovery and business
continuity plans, procedures and facilities that are consistent with best
practices in the industry. Copies of all current privacy policies, notices,
information security programs, backup, disaster recovery and business
continuity plans and security incident response plans of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been made available to the Purchaser. ​

(r) Except as set forth in _Section 3.13(r)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries have (i) complied in all
material respects with all applicable Laws and with their own respective
published policies and internal policies and guidelines relating to privacy,
data protection and data security, including with respect to the collection,
storage, transmission, transfer (including cross-border transfers), disclosure
and use of personal data; and (ii) taken commercially reasonable measures to
ensure that personal data is protected against loss, damage, and unauthorized
access, use, modification, or other misuse. No Person has made any claim or
commenced any legal proceeding with respect to loss, damage, or unauthorized
access, use, modification, or other misuse of any personal data by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and to the Seller's Knowledge, there is no
reasonable basis for any such claim or legal proceeding.

(s) Except as set forth on _Section 3.13(s)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries has experienced or suspected
any material unauthorized access to, use or misuse of, or other breach of
security with respect to (i) any software or other Systems or any personal
data or other data or information stored or processed thereon or thereby; or
(ii) any confidential information in the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
possession, custody or control.

(t) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established policies and procedures
for responding to, and have complied with any obligations relating to, data
subject requests for access, rectification, deletion, portability or

reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether

 _Section 6.2_ _Access and Investigation_. Prior to Closing, the Sellers and
the Company shall provide the Purchaser with reasonable access to the Persons
listed on _Schedule 6.2_. Following the Closing and upon reasonable advance
notice to the Purchaser, the Purchaser and its managers, officers, employees,

(a) The Company and the Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to (i)
file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the
United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the notification and report
form required by the HSR Act for the transactions contemplated hereby within
seven (7) Business Days of the date hereof or such later date as may be agreed
by the parties and to provide any additional or supplemental information and
documentary material requested by the FTC and DOJ pursuant to the HSR Act,
(ii) with respect to any other Governmental Authority, promptly make any other
filings or reports, and submit any information and documentation required for
the transactions contemplated hereby, pursuant to any other Antitrust Law,
(iii) subject to _Section 6.3(c)_ and _Section 6.3(d)_ , cause the ​

expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
or other Antitrust Law, as applicable, as soon as practicable after the date
hereof, and (iv) subject to _Section 6.3(c)_ and _Section 6.3(d)_ , avoid any
impediment to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby under
any applicable Laws (including the HSR Act and other Antitrust Law) which
would cause the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ and _Section 8.1(b)_
not to be satisfied as of the Closing, including using reasonable best efforts
to take all such action as may be reasonably necessary to resolve such
objections (if any) as the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Governmental Authority
or Person may assert under any applicable Laws (including the HSR Act and
other Antitrust Law) with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
which would cause the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ and _Section
8.1(b)_ not to be satisfied as of the Closing. If the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.1(a)_ and _Section 8.1(b)_ with regards to Antitrust Laws are not
satisfied as of the Outside Date, then the Parties shall discuss, in good
faith, a mutual agreement to extend the Outside Date if necessary to obtain
approval of the transaction under Antitrust Laws. Each of the Company and the
Purchaser shall furnish to each other's counsel such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act
and any other Antitrust Law. The Purchaser shall be responsible for the filing
fees payable in connection with the filings described in the first sentence of
this _Section 6.3_.

(b) The Company and the Purchaser shall: (i) promptly notify each other of any
oral or written communication received from any Governmental Authority, and
(ii) subject to applicable Law and excluding portions of documents relating to
valuation of the Agreement, furnish the other party copies of all
correspondence, submissions, and communications (and memoranda setting forth
substance thereof) between them and their respective Affiliates on one hand,
and any Governmental Authority on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement, including advanced drafts thereof and the reasonable opportunity to
comment on them. Except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority and
applicable Law, each party will consult and cooperate with the other, and will
consider in good faith, the views of the other party, in connection with any
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal made or submitted in connection with any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law. To the extent permitted by any such Governmental Authority,
each party will permit authorized representatives of the other party to be
present at each meeting or teleconference relating to any investigation or
legal proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Authority
in connection with any such investigation or legal proceeding. The Purchaser
shall have the sole right to devise and implement the strategy for obtaining
any necessary clearance or approval, for responding to any request, inquiry,
or investigation, for deciding whether to refile any pre-merger notification,
for defending any lawsuit challenging the transactions contemplated hereby,
and for leading in all meetings and communications with any Governmental
Authority that has authority to enforce the HSR Act or any other Antitrust
Law; provided however, that the Purchaser shall consult with the Company and
consider in good faith views expressed by the Company and its advisors
concerning the foregoing and will not reject any such views without the
Purchaser making its counsel available promptly to explain its rationale for
such rejection.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing shall require the Purchaser to take any action that will require, or
be deemed to require, the Purchaser or the Company to take any action
described in this _Section 6.3(c)_ that could reasonably be expected to have
or result in a Material Adverse Impact, including but not limited to any
Material Adverse Impact that would result from (i) disposing or transferring
any asset, including those of the Purchaser or the Company; (ii) licensing or
otherwise making available to any Person, any technology or other Intellectual
Property Rights of the Purchaser or the Company; (iii) holding separate any
assets or operations (either before or after the Closing Date) of the
Purchaser or the Company; or (iv) changing or modifying any course of conduct
or otherwise making any commitment (to any Governmental Authority or
otherwise) regarding future operations of the Purchaser or the Company's
business to obtain any approval from any Governmental ​

Authority or to prevent the initiation of any lawsuit by any Governmental
Authority under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Law or to prevent the entry of
any decree, judgment, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or any order that
would otherwise make the Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, or
any contingent agreements unlawful. "Material Adverse Impact" means any
material reduction in the value (including any anticipated economic benefit),
measured either individually or in the aggregate, of the Purchaser, the
Company or the combined businesses, expected from any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
contingent agreements, the Purchaser shall not be obligated to defend any
action or proceeding instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of the HSR Act or
other Antitrust Law, or if any decree, judgment, injunction or other order is
entered, enforced or attempted to be entered or enforced by a court or other
Governmental Authority, which decree, judgment, injunction or other order
would make the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or would
otherwise prohibit, prevent, restrict, impair or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Purchaser is not required to take any
action to contest or resist any such action or proceeding or to have vacated,
lifted, reversed, or overturned any such decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or to have such decree, judgment, injunction or other order
repealed, rescinded, or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable and in any event on
or prior to the Outside Date.

 _Section 6.4_ _No Solicitation of Other Bids_.

(a) The Sellers shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of their
Affiliates (including the Company) or any of its or their representatives to,
directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or
continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person
concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements
or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition
Proposal. The Sellers shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and
shall cause their Affiliates (including the Company) and all of its and their
representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect
to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof,
"Acquisition Proposal" shall mean, after the Execution Date, any inquiry,
proposal or offer from any Person (other than the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates) concerning (i) a merger, consolidation, liquidation,
recapitalization or other business combination transaction involving the
Company; (ii) the issuance or acquisition of membership interests in the
Company; or (iii) the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of any
significant portion of the Company's properties or assets.

(b) In addition to the other obligations under this _Section 6.4_ , the
Sellers shall promptly (and in any event within two Business Days after
receipt thereof by the Sellers or their representatives) advise the Purchaser
orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any request for information
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or
which could reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry, and the identity of the Person making the same.

(c) The Sellers agree that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this
_Section 6.4_ shall include having such provision specifically enforced by any
court having equity jurisdiction, it being ​

acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach shall cause
irreparable injury to the Purchaser and that money damages would not provide
an adequate remedy to the Purchaser.

 _Section 6.5_ _Confidentiality_.

(a) From and after the Closing, each Seller will, maintain the confidentiality
of, and not use for their own benefit or the benefit of any other Person, the
Confidential Information of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Company
Confidential Information") other than in connection with any dispute hereunder
or any Third Party Claim, or, as to each Rollover Member, as contemplated by
his Employment Agreement on behalf of Purchaser.

(b) Each Seller acknowledges that such Company Confidential Information
constitutes a unique and valuable asset of the Company and represents a
substantial investment of time and expense, and that any disclosure or other
use of such Company Confidential Information other than for the sole benefit
of the Purchaser would be wrongful and would cause irreparable harm to the
Purchaser. The foregoing obligations of confidentiality will not apply to any
Company Confidential Information that is or subsequently becomes generally
publicly known, other than as a direct or indirect result of the breach of
this Agreement by a Seller.

(c) Each Seller acknowledges that the Purchaser has required that such Seller
make the agreements in this _Section 6.5_ a condition to the Purchaser's
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Seller
agrees that the agreements contained in this _Section 6.5_ are reasonable and
necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Purchaser and that any
violation or breach of this _Section 6.5_ will result in irreparable injury to
the Purchaser for which no adequate remedy would exist at Law. Accordingly, in
addition to any relief at Law that may be available to the Purchaser for such
violation or breach and regardless of any other provision contained in this
Agreement, the Purchaser will be entitled to injunctive and other equitable
relief restraining such violation or breach (without any requirement that the
Purchaser provide any bond or other security).

(d) In the event that a Seller is requested or required (by oral question or
request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any
Company Confidential Information, such Seller will notify the Purchaser
promptly of the request or requirement so that the Purchaser may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section, except as may be reasonably necessary for the performance of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order
or the receipt of a waiver from the Purchaser, a Seller is, on the advice of
counsel, compelled to disclose any Company Confidential Information to any
tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, such Seller may disclose the
Company Confidential Information to the tribunal; provided, however, that such
Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts, at the request of the
Purchaser, to obtain or enable the Purchaser to obtain, in each case at the
Purchaser's cost, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded to such portion of the Company Confidential Information required
to be disclosed as the Purchaser designates.

(e) To the extent that any Seller (other than the Rollover Members) has not
done so prior to the Closing, each such Seller will, immediately following the
Closing, surrender to the Company all data, documents, records, data bases,
specifications, customer lists, financial reports and all other tangible
embodiments of Company Confidential Information, it being expressly understood
that all these writings, tangible embodiments and other things are the
exclusive property of the Company.

 _Section 6.6_ _Public Announcements_. Any public announcement or similar
publicity with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will be issued at such time and in such manner as the Purchaser
and the Seller Representative may mutually agree unless such ​

announcement is required by applicable Law or the rules and regulation of any
securities Laws or regulations or the rules of any securities exchange, in
which case, to the extent legally permissible, the Purchaser shall give the
Seller Representative prior notice including providing the Seller
Representative with a copy of the proposed disclosure in advance and shall
insofar as may be reasonably practicable and legally permissible reflect on
such disclosure all reasonable comments of Seller Representative. The
Purchaser and the Seller Representative will mutually agree with each other
concerning the means by which the employees, customers, suppliers and others
having dealings with the Company will be informed of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and with the consent of the Seller
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
the Purchaser has the right to be present for any such communication.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser may,
without the prior written consent of the Sellers or the Company, disclose any
information which the Purchaser is required to disclose under applicable
securities Laws or stock exchange rules; provided, however, to the extent
legally permissible, the Purchaser shall give the Seller Representative prior
notice including providing the Seller Representative with a copy of the
proposed disclosure in advance and shall insofar as may be reasonably
practicable and legally permissible reflect on such disclosure all reasonable
comments of Seller Representative.

 _Section 6.7_ _Notice of Certain Events_.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, the Sellers shall promptly notify
the Purchaser in writing of:

(i) any fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or
taking of which (A) has had, or could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (B) has resulted
in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, any representation or
warranty made by Seller hereunder not being true and correct or (C) has
resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the failure of any

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in

(iv) any Proceedings commenced or, to the Sellers' Knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting any Seller, the
Company or any Subsidiary that, if pending on the date of this Agreement,
would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to _Section 3.20_ or
that relates to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing, the Purchaser shall promptly
notify the Seller Representative in writing of:

(i) any fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or
taking of which (A) has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result
in, any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser hereunder not being
materially true and correct or (B) has resulted in, or could reasonably be
expected to result in, the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.3_ to be satisfied; ​

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(iv) any Proceedings commenced or, to the Purchaser's Knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Purchaser or any
of its Subsidiaries that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to have been disclosed pursuant to _Section 5.4_ or that relates
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) The receipt of information pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ by the Purchaser
or Seller Representative shall not operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any
representation, warranty or agreement given or made by the Purchaser, the
Sellers or the Company in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to amend or
supplement the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule.

 _Section 6.8_ _Protective Covenants_. In consideration of the completion of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Sellers agree, severally
and not jointly, that during the Restricted Period, without the prior written
consent of the Company, each Seller shall comply with the terms of this
_Section 6.8_. Each Seller acknowledges that the promises and restrictive
covenants such Seller is providing in this Agreement are reasonable and
necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Purchaser in the
acquisition of the Company pursuant to this Agreement, including but not
limited to the goodwill of the Company. The Parties agree that the provisions
of this Agreement shall apply to all parts of the world where the Company or
the Purchaser conduct business at any time. Each Seller acknowledges that the
Business is national and international, rather than local, in scope. The
Parties expressly understand and agree that the noncompetition provisions
contained in this Agreement are reasonable, permissible and enforceable
pursuant to the provisions of applicable Law.

(a) Except as provided in the last two paragraphs of this _Section 6.8(a)_ ,
each Seller agrees that during the Restricted Period, such Seller shall not,
directly or indirectly, as an owner, member, partner, shareholder, joint
venturer, corporate officer, director, employee, consultant, principal,
trustee or licensor, or in any other capacity whatsoever of or for provide
services to (i) any Person, firm, partnership, company or corporation (other
than the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates) (each an "Entity") that is
principally engaged in the Business or (ii) any division, group, Subsidiary or
any other subsection of an Entity (each a "Division") if such Division is
principally engaged in the Business (whether or not such Entity is engaged in
the Business):

(i) own, manage, operate, sell, control or participate in the ownership,
management, operation, sales or control of, be involved with, or assist in the
development efforts of or serve as an advisor to any business that competes
with the Business;

(ii) solicit, or attempt to solicit, the business or patronage of any of the
clients, customers or suppliers of the Company, any Subsidiary or the
Purchaser in connection with the Business; or

(iii) lend or allow his name or reputation to be used by or otherwise allow
his skill, knowledge or experience to be used by any business that competes
with the Company, and Subsidiary or the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to the Business. ​

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Seller is permitted to own, individually,
as a passive investor, up to a two percent (2%) interest in any publicly
traded entity. For purposes hereof, competition with the Company, the
Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries with respect to the Business shall be
prohibited in any county in the State of California, each state in the United
States and each country in the world where the Company or any Subsidiary
conducts business. In addition, such Seller may work for a Division of an
Entity that has another Division engaged in the Business so long as the Entity
is not principally engaged in the Business and such Seller does not work in
any way for the Division engaged in the Business.

Specifically this _Section 6.8_ does not limit such Seller from collaboration
with competitors of the Purchaser in the form of system integration,
certification testing, joint customer deployments, co-marketing activities or
any other activity that is in the normal course of business for a company
engaged in the Business.

(b) Each Seller further agrees that during the Restricted Period, such Seller
shall not:

(i) directly or indirectly, personally or through others, solicit (on such
Seller's own behalf or on behalf of any other person, Entity or Division) any
employee of the Purchaser or the Company to leave his or her employment with
the Purchaser or the Company (provided that the foregoing shall not preclude
general solicitations for employment not specifically directed at such
employees);

(ii) directly or indirectly, personally or through others, solicit any person
or entity who both is at the time of such solicitation and was at the
beginning of the Restricted Period a customer or client of the Purchaser or
the Company (a "Customer") to obtain goods or services from any party other
than the Purchaser, the Company, or its or their Affiliates, or otherwise
intentionally interfere with the relationship of the Purchaser or the Company
with any Customer.

(c) The covenants contained in this _Section 6.8_ shall be each construed as a
series of separate covenants, one for each county, city, state and country of
any geographic area where any business is carried on by Parent. Except for
geographic coverage, each such separate covenant shall be identical in terms
to the covenant contained in _Section 6.8(a)_ or _Section 6.8(b)_ , as the
case may be. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court refuses to enforce any
of such separate covenants (or any part thereof), then such unenforceable
covenant (or such part) shall be eliminated from this Agreement to the extent
necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions thereof) to
be enforced. In the event that the provisions of this Agreement are deemed to
exceed the time, geographic or scope limitations permitted by applicable law,
then such provisions shall be reformed to the maximum time, geographic or
scope limitations, as the case may be, permitted by applicable Law.

(d) Each Seller acknowledges that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement
are reasonable both individually and in the aggregate and that the duration,
geographic scope, extent and application of each of such restrictions are no
greater than is necessary for the protection of the legitimate business
interests of the Purchaser, which include but are not limited to, the
Company's trade secrets and other valuable confidential business information
related to the Business, its substantial relationships with prospective or
existing customers and suppliers related to the Business, and the goodwill
associated with the Business. Each Seller hereby acknowledges and recognizes
that the enforcement of any of the provisions in this Agreement may
potentially interfere with such Seller's ability to pursue certain areas of
employment. Each Seller recognizes and agrees that the enforcement this
Agreement is necessary to ensure the preservation, protection and continuity
of the business, trade secrets and goodwill of the Purchaser and the Company. ​

 _Section 6.9_ _Non-Disparagement_. No Seller will take any action that is
designed or intended to have the effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor,
customer, supplier or other business associate of the Company or any
Subsidiary from maintaining the same business relationship with the Company or
Subsidiary after the Closing as the Company or Subsidiary maintained prior to
the Closing.

 _Section 6.10_ _Employment Arrangements_. Except with respect to Scott Rouse
and to individuals who enter into employment agreements with the Purchaser, or
an Affiliate of the Purchaser, with respect to post-Closing employment, for a
period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, the Purchaser agrees that
the Company shall continue to provide each employee who was employed by the
Company immediately prior to the Closing Date, including any such employee on
vacation or a leave of absence, and who remains employed by the Company or the
Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser after the Closing Date (each, a
"Continuing Employee") (i) the same base salary or base hourly wage rate as in
effect for such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Execution Date,
and (ii) target bonus opportunity, or target commission opportunity and (iii)
employee benefits, such that (ii) and (iii) taken together as a whole, are not
materially less favorable than those provided to the Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date (except that, in each case, the
Purchaser shall not be obligated to provide any equity compensation, profits
interests or similar compensation); provided, however, that the Purchaser may
terminate employment of any Continuing Employee for valid business reasons,
after consulting with the Company's management, or for cause following the
Closing.

The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties hereto and shall not confer upon any Person any third-party
beneficiary rights. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.10_ , whether express
or implied: (i) shall be treated as establishing, amending or modifying for
any purpose any Company Benefit Plan; (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of
the Purchaser, the Company or any of their Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan or other benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement of the Purchaser; or (iii) is intended to confer upon any
current or former employee any right to employment or continued employment for
any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular
term or condition of employment.

 _Section 6.11_ _Stock Exchange Listing_. The Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Consideration Shares to be (i) conditionally approved for
listing by the Toronto Stock Exchange, subject to satisfaction of the
conditions contained in the conditional approval letter, and (ii) approved for
listing by the New York Stock Exchange, prior to the Closing.

 _Section 6.12_ _PPP Loan_. Prior to Closing, the Company shall (1) notify CNB
of the anticipated change in ownership of the Company, including delivery of a
fully executed copy of the Agreement, (2) deposit an amount (the "CNB Escrow
Amount") equal to the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of the PPP
Loan, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, into an escrow account
with CNB (the "CNB Escrow"), and (3) deliver an application (the "Forgiveness
Application") to seek forgiveness of some or all of the PPP Loan in accordance
with the then applicable requirements of the CARES Act. After the Closing, the
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, promptly inform and deliver
to the Seller Representative any and all material communications received from
any Governmental Authority or lender in respect of the PPP Loan and shall not
initiate any communications with any Governmental Authority or lender in
respect of the PPP Loan without the prior written consent of the Seller
Representative. The Purchaser will not cause the Company to amend or withdraw
the Forgiveness Application following the Closing, except upon the written
request of the Seller Representative.

 _Section 6.13_ _Closing Conditions_. From the date hereof until the Closing,
each party hereto shall, and the Sellers shall cause the Company to, use
reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are necessary to expeditiously
satisfy the closing conditions set forth in _ARTICLE 8_. ​

 _Section 6.14_ _Further Assurances_. Subject to the other express provisions
of this Agreement, upon the reasonable request of any party to this Agreement,
the other parties will (a) furnish to the requesting party any additional
information, (b) execute and deliver, at their own expense, any other
documents and (c) take any other actions as the requesting party may
reasonably require to more effectively carry out the intent of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 _Section 6.15_ _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any
party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and
agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Purchaser,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Business prior to
the Closing and (b) prior to the Closing, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over the operation of the Business.

 _Section 6.16_ _Parent Guaranty_. The Parent hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees (the "Parent Guaranty"), by way of an independent
obligation to the Sellers (i) the due, prompt and faithful performance by the
Purchaser of all undertakings, obligations, required acts and performances of
the Purchaser to the Sellers under or arising out of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements; and (ii) the due and punctual payment of all amounts due
and payable by the Purchaser to the Sellers under or arising out of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements after the date hereof, when and as the
same shall arise and become due and payable in accordance with the terms of
and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements (the "Guaranteed Obligations"). The Parent guarantees as principal
obligor and not as surety the prompt performance and payment of all Guaranteed
Obligations, this being a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of
collection. This Parent Guaranty is not contingent upon the pursuit by the
Sellers of any rights or remedies against the Purchaser, such pursuit being
hereby waived by the Parent. This Parent Guaranty shall be binding upon all
successors and assigns of the Parent.

 _Section 6.17_ _Information and Reports_. Upon the request of any Rollover
Member, the Purchaser shall furnish to any Rollover Member so long as such
Rollover Member owns Consideration Shares, promptly upon request, a written
statement by the Parent as to its compliance with the reporting requirements
of Rule 144 and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, a copy of the most
recent annual or quarterly report of the Parent, and such other reports and
documents so filed or furnished by the Parent as such Rollover Member may
reasonably request in connection with the sale of Consideration Shares without
registration. Upon the request of any Rollover Member, and subject to the
receipt of an opinion of counsel as contemplated by _Section 4.4_ and _Section
4.5_ , the Purchaser shall cooperate with such Rollover Member to facilitate
the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing the
Consideration Shares free of any restrictive legends to the extent permitted
under _Section 4.4_ and _Section 4.5_.

 _Section 6.18_ _Termination of Certain Guaranties_. Purchaser and Parent
acknowledge that in the

course of the conduct of the business of the Company, Scott Rouse has entered
into arrangements in which guarantees were issued by him to support or
facilitate business transactions of the Company (the "Credit Support
Arrangements.") The Parties agree that the Credit Support Arrangements are not
intended to continue after the Closing. In order to obtain the release of
Scott Rouse from any such Credit Support Arrangements at the Closing,
Purchaser, and to the extent applicable, the Company and Parent will take all
reasonably necessary actions to effect the termination of such Credit Support
Arrangements.

 **ARTICLE 7**

 **CERTAIN TAX MATTERS**

 _Section 7.1_ _Tax Matters and Tax Returns_.

(a) The parties intend for the purchase of the Membership Interests
contemplated by this Agreement to be treated as a transaction governed by Rev.
Rul. 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 434 (Situation 2), with the Sellers being treated as
having sold their Membership Interests, and the Purchaser being treated as ​

acquiring all of the Company's assets, in exchange for the Purchase Price (as
adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.3_ and _ARTICLE 7_ ) plus the Liabilities of
the Company.

(b) The parties shall allocate the Purchase Price (plus the Liabilities of the
Company and the Subsidiaries) among the assets of the Company and the
Subsidiaries in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing, but not later than 60 days
thereafter, the Purchaser shall prepare an allocation of the Purchase Price
(plus the Liabilities of the Company and the Subsidiaries) among the assets of
the Company and the Subsidiaries (the "First Allocation"), which the Purchaser
shall deliver to the Seller Representatives. The Purchase Price Allocation
shall not allocate more than $1,000,000 of the Purchase Price to the covenants
contained in _Section 6.8_. On or prior to the 30th day following the
Purchaser's delivery of the First Allocation, the Seller Representative may
give the Purchaser written notice stating his objection to the First
Allocation. If the Seller Representative notifies the Purchaser of such an
objection, then the Purchaser shall engage a nationally recognized valuation
firm mutually acceptable to the Purchaser and the Seller Representative, with
each of the Purchaser and the Seller Representative bearing one-half of the
expense. The Seller Representative shall be permitted to meet with such
valuation firm to address his objections to the First Allocation. The
Purchaser shall deliver such valuation firm's purchase price allocation (the
"Second Allocation") to Seller Representative within five days of receipt.
Within 10 days of the Seller Representative's receipt of the Second
Allocation, the Seller Representative shall notify the Purchaser of the Seller
Representative's acceptance of either the First Allocation or the Second
Allocation, and such allocation as accepted by the Seller Representative shall
be final, conclusive and binding on the parties and shall be referred to as
the "Purchase Price Allocation." The parties shall report, act and file all
Tax Returns in all respects and for all purposes consistent with the Purchase
Price Allocation and this _Section 7.1_ , and no party shall take any position
(whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the
Purchase Price Allocation or this _Section 7.1_ unless required to do so by
applicable Law. If the Purchase Price is adjusted in any manner as provided
in this Agreement, the Purchase Price Allocation shall be adjusted as set
forth in the Purchase Price Allocation schedule.

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that the Consideration Shares are being
paid by the Purchaser to the Rollover Members solely in exchange for the
Rollover Members' sale to the Purchaser of a portion of their respective
Membership Interests in the Company. The parties further acknowledge and agree
that Consideration Shares are being issued to the Rollover Members subject to
the Restrictions described in _Section 2.6_ to protect the business value of
the Company being acquired by the Purchaser. Each of the Rollover Members
shall file elections under Section 83(b) of the Code with the IRS with respect
to the Consideration Shares within twenty (20) days of the Closing Date
confirming that the issuance of the Consideration Shares does not constitute
the receipt of any ordinary income under Section 83 of the Code. The Rollover
Members shall provide written evidence to the Purchaser of the filing of such
election with the IRS within twenty (20) days of the Closing Date. The
Purchaser and the Rollover Members will take all positions consistent with,
and shall not take any position inconsistent with, on all financial
statements, Tax Returns, and otherwise, the Rollover Members' receipt of the
Consideration Shares constituting long-term capital gains (subject to any
ordinary income treatment required under applicable partnership related Tax
rules) on the Closing Date and shall further take all commercially reasonable
efforts to otherwise confirm such treatment. If the IRS successfully asserts
upon audit and after any related tax contest, that the receipt of the
Consideration Shares constitutes ordinary income to any or all of the Rollover
Members due to the Restrictions described in _Section 2.6_ (a "Tax
Determination"), the Purchaser, promptly following a demand from a Rollover
Member, shall pay an amount to such Rollover Member equal to: (i) the
additional Taxes owed, plus all penalties and interest thereon by such
Rollover Member as a result of the IRS successfully asserting that the receipt
of the Consideration Shares constituted ordinary income, not long-term capital
gains; plus (ii) any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses, including, without limitation, legal and other professional fees and
costs, incurred by such Rollover Member in connection with such Rollover
Member or the Purchaser, if it so opts pursuant to _Section 7.4(b)_ ,
contesting ​

or resulting from the Tax Determination (with all such payments under clauses
(i) and (ii) above made on an After Tax Basis).

(d) The Sellers shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed), at
Seller's expense, on a timely basis all Tax Returns of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date that
are initially due (including extensions) after the Closing Date. Such Tax
Returns will be prepared in a manner consistent with and utilizing the
accounting methods utilized in the preparation of the prior Tax Returns of the
Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, to the extent such accounting
methods comply with applicable Law. The Purchaser shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to provide the Sellers and their representatives with access
to the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably
necessary during normal working hours to prepare such Tax Returns. The
Sellers (i) will submit all such Tax Returns and any requested work papers to
the Purchaser for its review at least 30 days prior to filing and shall make
any revisions reasonably requested by the Purchaser to the extent such
revisions comply with applicable Law and are consistent with and utilize the
accounting methods utilized by the Company on its prior Tax Returns and (ii)
will, promptly after filing, forward to the Purchaser a complete copy of such
filed Tax Returns and proof of payment of the subject Taxes; provided,
however, that the Purchaser shall pay any accrued or reserved Taxes taken into
account in determining the Final Closing Net Working Capital as provided in
_Section 7.2(a)_. In the event that Sellers fail to prepare and file or cause
to be prepared or filed any Tax Return they are required to file pursuant to
this _Section 7.1(d)_ , the Purchaser shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to prepare and file such Tax Returns at Sellers' expense.

(e) The Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed)
all Tax Returns with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
taxable periods ending after the Closing Date (as well as any Tax Returns for
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date that it elects to file
under _Section 7.1(d)_ ).

 _Section 7.2_ _Payment of Taxes_.

(a) To the extent that Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
taxable periods and portions of periods through the Closing Date (including
all such Taxes payable with respect to Tax Returns filed under this _Article
7_ and any Taxes assessed after the Closing with respect to taxable periods or
portions of periods through the Closing Date) are accrued or expressly
reserved for as current Liabilities in line items on the Closing Balance Sheet
and taken into account in determining the Final Closing Net Working Capital,
the Purchaser will pay or cause to be paid such Taxes. To the extent such
Taxes for all taxable periods and portions of periods through the Closing Date
are not so reflected as current Liabilities on the Closing Balance Sheet and
not taken into account in determining the Final Closing Net Working Capital,
the Sellers will pay all such Taxes. Taxes that are payable with respect to a
taxable period that begins before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing
Date will be allocated to the portion of the period that ends on the Closing
Date in accordance with _Section 7.3_. All Company level Taxes arising from
the Employee Closing Payments will be pre-Closing Tax Liabilities to be paid
by the Sellers.

(b) In the case of Tax Returns filed by the Purchaser under this _ARTICLE 7_
and as to which the Purchaser expects payment from the Sellers, the Purchaser
may elect to deliver the pertinent Tax Return to the Sellers and inform the
Sellers of any amounts due from the Sellers at least ten days prior to the due
date of the pertinent Tax Return and the Sellers will pay such amounts to the
Purchaser in immediately available funds at least two Business Days prior to
the due date of the Tax Return. In the case of any Tax Returns filed by the
Sellers, the Sellers will pay the amount of Taxes due with respect to such Tax
Returns (with the Purchaser being required to supply any amounts payable by
the Purchaser by the due date of the subject Tax Return). ​

 _Section 7.3_ _Tax Apportionment_. In the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to a taxable period that begins before the Closing Date and ends after
the Closing Date (the "Straddle Period"), the portion of any such Tax that is
allocable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date will be:

(a) in the case of Taxes that are either (i) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (ii) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than
any transaction Taxes contemplated by _Section 7.7_ ), deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the taxable period ended as of the close of
business on the Closing Date; and

(b) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise measured by the
level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
(or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of
such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire period.

 _Section 7.4_ _Tax Proceedings_.

(a) After the Closing Date, each Rollover Member shall notify the Purchaser in
writing within ten (10) days of the receipt of any proposed assessment or the
commencement of any Tax audit or other administrative or judicial proceeding
or of any demand or claim that relates to the Tax treatment or
characterization of the receipt of the Consideration Shares by such Rollover
Member (a "Rollover Member Tax Proceeding"), and the Purchaser shall notify
the Sellers in writing within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of any proposed
assessment or the commencement of any Tax audit or other administrative or
judicial proceeding or of any demand or claim that relates to the Taxes of the
Company or any Subsidiary for any taxable periods or portions of taxable
periods through the Closing Date (a "Company Tax Proceeding", and together
with a Rollover Member Tax Proceeding, a "Tax Proceeding"). Any such notice
shall contain factual information describing any such Tax Proceeding in
reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document
received from any Governmental Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax
Proceeding; provided, however, the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder (including any payment
obligations pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ , except to the extent the
indemnifying party has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(b) In the case of any Rollover Member Tax Proceeding, the Purchaser shall
have the right, at the Purchaser's sole expense, to control the conduct and
defense of such Tax Proceeding (but only to the extent the Purchaser conducts
the defense of such Rollover Member Tax Proceeding actively, diligently and in
good faith); _provided_ , that if the Purchaser is entitled to control such
Rollover Member Tax Proceeding pursuant to the foregoing sentence, each
applicable Rollover Member shall have the right, at such Rollover Member's
sole expense and not subject to the indemnity provided in _Section 7.1(c)_ ,
to participate in (but not control) such Rollover Member Tax Proceeding and
the Purchaser shall not settle such Rollover Member Tax Proceeding without the
written consent of the applicable Rollover Member, which such consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed conditioned.

(c) In the case of any Company Tax Proceeding, the Sellers shall have the
right, at the Sellers' sole expense, to control the conduct of such Company
Tax Proceeding (but only to the extent the Sellers conduct the defense of such
Company Tax Proceeding actively, diligently and in good faith); _provided_ ,
that if the Sellers are entitled to control such Company Tax Proceeding
pursuant to the foregoing sentence, the Purchaser shall have the right, at the
Purchaser's sole expense, to participate in (but not control) such Company Tax
Proceeding and the Sellers shall not settle such Company Tax Proceeding
without the written consent of the Purchaser, which such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. In the event the Company is
subject to a final partnership adjustment for any taxable periods or portions
of taxable tax periods through the Closing Date, such adjustment shall be
taken into account by the former ​

partners of the Company pursuant to Section 6241(7) of the Code or the Company
shall make or cause to be made an election under Section 6226 of the Code with
respect to such adjustment, each as applicable.

 _Section 7.5_ _Cooperation_. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to _Section
7.1_ and any Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation may include signing Tax returns,
amended Tax Returns, claims or other documents necessary to settle any Tax
Proceeding, the retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision
of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Proceeding or other proceeding and making themselves or their employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material or information provided hereby. The Purchaser
(after the Closing) shall retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries, and will cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to retain all books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries, relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations for the respective taxable periods, and
shall abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Governmental Authority. The Purchaser agrees to give the Seller
Representative reasonable notice prior to transferring, discarding or
destroying any such books and records relating to Tax matters and, if the
Seller Representative so request, the Purchaser shall allow the Seller
Representative to take possession of such books and records.

 _Section 7.6_ _Amended Tax Returns; Tax Elections; Other Tax Matters_. The
Sellers will not, and will not cause or permit the Company to, without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed): (i) make or revoke, or cause or permit to
be made or revoked, any Tax election pertaining to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or the ownership of any capital equity of the Company, if such
election could result in the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates being liable
for any amounts, including under this Agreement or to any Governmental
Authority in respect of Taxes; (ii) file, or allow to be filed, any amended
Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable periods
or portions of taxable periods beginning before the Closing Date through the
Closing Date, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, if such amendment
could result in the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates being liable for any
amounts, including under this Agreement or to any Governmental Authority in
respect of Taxes; or (iii) apply to any Governmental Authority for any binding
or non-binding opinion, ruling, or other determination with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in relation to any act, matter or
transaction that occurred on or before the Closing Date or that relates to any
taxable periods or portions of taxable periods beginning before the Closing
Date through the Closing Date. The Purchaser will not, without the prior
written consent of the Seller Representative (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) cause or permit the Company, or
any of its Subsidiaries, to (i) file (other than in accordance with Section
7.1(d)) or amend any Tax Return that relates in whole or in part to any
taxable period that begins before the Closing Date, (ii) make any election
that has retroactive effect to any taxable period that begins before the
Closing Date, (iii) voluntarily approach any taxing authority regarding
taxable periods or portions thereof of the Company ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, if such amendment or election could result in the Sellers being
liable for any amounts, including under this Agreement or to any Governmental
Authority in respect of Taxes (each a "Restricted Tax Action"). The Rollover
Members will not, and will not cause any Person to, without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed): (i) make or revoke, or cause or permit to be made or
revoked, any Tax election pertaining to the receipt of the Consideration
Shares other than an election pursuant to Section 83(b) as provided herein;
(ii) file, or allow to be filed, any amended Tax Return of such Rollover
Member for the Tax period that amends the Tax treatment of the receipt of the
Consideration Shares, if such amendment could result in the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates being liable for any amounts, including under this Agreement
or to any Governmental Authority in respect of Taxes; or (iii) apply to any
Governmental Authority for any binding or non-binding opinion, ruling, or ​

other determination with respect to, or that relates to, such Rollover
Member's receipt of the Consideration Shares.

 _Section 7.7_ _Transactional Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, all transfer, documentary, recording, notarial, sales, use,
registration, stamp and other similar Taxes or fees imposed by any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and any applicable filing expenses, will be borne fifty
percent (50%) by the Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers, pro
rata based on their respective share of the Purchase Price. The Sellers will
file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such Taxes and, if required by applicable Law, the Purchaser will, and will
cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or
other documentation.

 _Section 7.8_ _Tax Refunds_. Except to the extent reflected as an asset in
the final calculation of Final Closing Net Working Capital, the Sellers will
be entitled to any Tax refunds of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are
received by the Purchaser, the Company or a Subsidiary (in each case,
including any amounts credited against Tax) to which the Purchaser, the
Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable, become entitled in any post-Closing
Taxable period, but excluding any Tax refunds related to any carryback of
losses attributable to a post-Closing taxable period, that relate to any pre-
Closing taxable period. In determining the portion of a Tax refund or credit
relating to a pre-Closing taxable period, any refund of Taxes relating to a
Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and that portion of such Straddle
Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date in accordance with the
principles set forth in _Section 7.3_. The Purchaser will pay over to the
Sellers, pro rata based on their respective share of the Purchase Price, any
such refund or the amount of any such credit within five (5) days after actual
receipt of such refund or credit against Taxes.

prior to the Closing:

(a) By mutual agreement of the Purchaser and the Sellers;

(b) By either the Purchaser or the Seller Representative, by giving written
notice to the other Party, if (i) a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree
or ruling having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
pursuant to (x) the HSR Act or (y) 31 CFR Part 800 (the CFIUS regulations), or
(ii) any Governmental Authority shall institute any Proceeding challenging the
validity or legality, or seeking to restrain the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(c) By the Purchaser, (i) if Sellers or the Company have breached or failed to
perform any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement
required to be complied with by them, which breach or failure to perform would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Article 8_ or (ii) there
exists a breach of or inaccuracy in a representation or warranty of Seller or
the Company contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.2_ , and
in the case of either (i) or (ii) above, such breach or failure is not cured
within 15 days after receipt of written notice thereof or is incapable of
being cured by the Sellers or the Company before the Outside Date; provided,
however, that the Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_ if the Purchaser is then in
material breach of this Agreement;

(d) By the Sellers, (i) if the Purchaser has breached or failed to perform any
of its covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement required to
be complied with by it, which breach or failure to perform would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Article 8_ or (ii) there exists a
breach of or inaccuracy in a representation or warranty of the Purchaser
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.3_ , and in the

9.1(d) if the Sellers are then in material breach of this Agreement;

shall not have occurred on or before the Outside Date, and, as of the Outside
Date, all of the conditions precedent set forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section
8.2_ are satisfied, except for those conditions that, by their nature, are to
be satisfied at the Closing (but were capable of being satisfied as of the
Outside Date if the Closing were to occur on the Outside Date); or

(f) by the Purchaser, by giving written notice to the Seller Representative,
if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Outside Date (or such
later date as the Purchaser and the Seller Representative may mutually agree)
by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under _Section 8.2_
(unless the failure results primarily from a breach by the Purchaser of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Purchaser contained in this
Agreement or the Purchaser's failure to fulfill a condition precedent to the
Closing or other default or acts or omissions to act by the Purchaser that has
the effect of delaying the Closing).

 _Section 9.2_ _Effect of Termination_. ​

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated by the Sellers pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)_ or _Section 9.1(e)_ , then the Purchaser shall pay to the
Company a fee of $13,750,000, such payment to be made within 30 days of
termination or the Outside Date, as applicable. Such fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company and the Sellers in lieu of any other relief,
right or remedy, at Law or in equity, to which the Company or the Sellers
might otherwise be entitled. The Purchaser and the Sellers agree that such
fee is a reasonable estimate of the Sellers' and the Company's damages and not
a penalty.

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 9.1_
, this Agreement shall immediately become void and, except as otherwise
provided in _Section 9.2(a)_ , there shall be no Liability or obligation on
the part of any Party or their respective officers, directors, stockholders or
Affiliates, except for any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

 **ARTICLE 10**

Indemnified Parties") from and against, and will pay and reimburse them for,
any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
directly or indirectly arising out of, relating to or resulting from any of
the following:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of any
Seller or the Company contained in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or in

Company pursuant to this Agreement but specifically excluding the Employment
Agreements;

(b) any nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or agreement of any

be liable as a transferee or successor, by contract, agreement or otherwise,
in each instance to the extent such Taxes arose during the taxable periods or
portions thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date, in each case to the
extent that such Taxes did not result from a Restricted Tax Action which was
not consented to by the Seller Representative;

(d) any Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries existing prior
to the Closing that is not fully extinguished prior to or as of the Closing
which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include items (i)(1) through (4)
in the definition of Indebtedness which pursuant to Section 10.12 Purchaser
and Parent have jointly and severally agreed to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Released Parties against any claims, actions and Liabilities
related thereto; ​

(e) after determination by the SBA of whether the Indebtedness under the PPP

pursuant to _Section 2.5(f)_ ;

(f) the allocation of the Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with the
Member Allocation Schedule;

(g) the Employee Closing Payments; and

(h) any Liability of the Company or the Subsidiaries arising from or relating

For the purposes of this _Section 10.1_ any inaccuracy in, or breach of any
representation or warranty by any Seller or the Company shall be determined
without regard to any reference to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or
similar qualifications.

 _Section 10.2_ _Indemnification by the Purchaser_.

(a) Subject to the limitations expressly set forth in _Section 10.5_ and
_Section 10.6_ , the Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers
from and against, and will pay and reimburse them for, any and all Losses
incurred or suffered by the Sellers directly or indirectly arising out of,
relating to or resulting from any of the following:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty or other
statement of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement; and

(ii) any nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or agreement of the
Purchaser or the Company (solely with respect to covenants to be performed
after the Closing Date) contained in this Agreement.

(b) The Purchaser will also indemnify and hold harmless the Rollover Members
as provided in _Section 7.1(c)_ (the "Rollover Member Indemnity"). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Rollover Member Indemnity shall (x) survive until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for assessment by a
Governmental Authority against each applicable Rollover Member and (y) not be
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 10.6_.

For the purposes of this _Section 10.2_ any inaccuracy in, or breach of any
representation or warranty by the Purchaser shall be determined without regard
to any reference to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualifications.

 _Section 10.3_ _Claim Procedure_.

(a) A party that seeks indemnity under this _ARTICLE 10_ (an "Indemnified
Party") will give prompt written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the party from
whom indemnification is sought (an "Indemnifying Party") containing (i) a
description with reasonable detail and, if known, the estimated amount of any
Losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party
and the method of computation thereof, and (ii) a reasonable explanation of
the basis for the Claim Notice to the extent of the facts then known by the
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no delay or deficiency on
the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party will
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability or obligation under this
Agreement except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is thereby materially
prejudiced. For purposes of this _ARTICLE 10_ , the Seller ​

Representative, as representative of the Sellers, shall receive all notices
and take all actions on behalf of the Sellers.

(b) Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party
will deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response to such Claim Notice.
During such 30 day period, the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors shall have the opportunity to investigate the matter or circumstance
alleged to give rise to the Claim Notice, and whether and to what extent any
amount is payable in respect of the Claim Notice and the Indemnified Party
shall assist the Indemnifying Party's investigation by giving such reasonably
requested information in the possession of the Indemnified Party with respect
to such Claim Notice upon prior written notice and during normal business
hours as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may
reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party fails to so respond within 30
days after delivery of the Claim Notice, then the Indemnifying Party will be
deemed to have irrevocably accepted the Claim Notice and agreed to pay the
Losses at issue in the Claim Notice.

(c) If any Purchaser Indemnified Party is the Indemnified Party with respect
to any claim for indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE 10_ and the Escrow
Amount remains in the Escrow Account, the parties will contemporaneously
deliver to the Escrow Agent copies of each Claim Notice and Objection Notice
in connection with such claim.

(d) If, within 30 days after delivery of the Claim Notice, the Indemnifying
Party delivers a written notice disputing the Indemnified Party's entitlement
to indemnification for the Losses described in the Claim Notice (an "Objection
Notice"), then the dispute may be resolved by any legally available means
consistent with the provisions of _Section 11.11_.

(e) Any indemnification payment pursuant to this _ARTICLE 10_ will be effected
by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Indemnifying Party to
an account designated by the Indemnified Party, and will be made within five
Business Days after the date on which (i) the amount of such payments are
determined by mutual agreement of the parties, (ii) the amount of such
payments are determined pursuant to _Section 10.3_ if a written response has
not been timely delivered in accordance with _Section 10.3(b)_ or (iii) both
such amount and the Indemnifying Party's obligation to pay such amount have
been finally determined by a final judgment of a court having jurisdiction
over such proceeding as permitted by _Section 11.11_ if a written response has
been timely delivered in accordance with _Section 10.3(b)_.

 _Section 10.4_ _Third Party Claims_.

(a) If any Indemnified Party receives notice of a claim or demand, whether or
not involving a Proceeding, by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement
or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement (a "Third Party Claim") against
such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party will promptly (and in any event within 30 days following the earlier of
receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim or the Indemnified Party's
awareness of such action) give the Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice. Such
Claim Notice will describe the facts constituting the basis for such Third
Party Claim and the amount of the damages claimed by the other Person, in each
case to the extent known to the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party
shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such other information with respect
thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no delay or deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party in so
notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
Liability or obligation under this Agreement except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is thereby materially prejudiced.

(b) Within 30 days after the Indemnifying Party's delivery of a Claim Notice
under this _Section 10.4_ , the Indemnifying Party may assume control of the
defense of such Third Party Claim by giving to the ​

Indemnified Party written notice of the intention to assume such defense, but
if and only if the Indemnifying Party further:

(i) acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that any Losses that may
be assessed in connection with the Third Party Claim constitute Losses for
which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified pursuant to and subject to the
limitations in this _ARTICLE 10_ without contest or objection and that the
Indemnifying Party will advance all expenses and costs of defense; and

(ii) retains counsel for the defense of the Third Party Claim reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and furnishes to the Indemnified Party
evidence satisfactory to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party has
and will have sufficient financial resources to fund on a current basis the
cost of such defense and pay all Losses that may arise under the Third Party
Claim.

However, if the Sellers are the Indemnifying Party, in no event may the
Indemnifying Party assume, maintain control of, or participate in, the defense
of any Third Party Claim (A) involving criminal liability, (B) in which any
relief other than monetary damages is sought against the Indemnified Party,
(C) in which the Purchaser Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that the
Indemnifying Party and the Purchaser Indemnified Party have conflicting
interests or different defenses available with respect to the Third Party
Claim or (D) in which the outcome of any judgment or settlement in the matter
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Indemnified Party's Tax
Liability or the ability of the Indemnified Party to conduct its business
other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement (collectively, clauses (A) - (D), the
"Special Claims"). An Indemnifying Party will lose any previously acquired
right to control the defense of any Third Party Claim if for any reason the
Indemnifying Party ceases to actively, competently and diligently conduct the
defense.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not, or is not able to, assume or maintain
control of the defense of a Third Party Claim in compliance with _Section
10.4(b)_ , the Indemnified Party will have the right to control the defense of
the Third Party Claim. To the extent that the Third Party Claim does not
constitute a Special Claim, the party not controlling the defense (the
"Noncontrolling Party") may participate therein at its own expense. The party
controlling the defense (the "Controlling Party") will reasonably advise the
Noncontrolling Party of the status of the Third Party Claim and the defense
thereof and, with respect to any Third Party Claim that does not relate to a
Special Claim, the Controlling Party will consider in good faith
recommendations made by the Noncontrolling Party. The Noncontrolling Party
will furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with
respect to such Third Party Claim and related Proceedings (including copies of
any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such
party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document
evidencing or asserting the same) and will otherwise cooperate with and assist
in the defense of the Third Party Claim.

(d) If the Indemnified Party is controlling the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party will not consent to any compromise or settlement
of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, the Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent the
Indemnifying Party will not unreasonably withheld or delayed. All amounts paid
or payable under such settlement or judgment are Losses that the Indemnifying
Party owes to the Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE 10_. The Indemnifying
Party will not agree to any compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party, which consent the Indemnified Party will not
unreasonably withhold or delay. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party will have no Liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of,
or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim effected
without its consent. ​

 _Section 10.5_ _Survival_. All representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement (but specifically excluding the Employment Agreements) will survive
the Closing, for a period of 12 months from the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.15 ( _Tax Matters_ ) will survive until 90 days following the expiration of
the statute of limitations applicable to the underlying matters covered by
such provision, taking into account any tolling periods or extensions, and
(ii) the Seller Fundamental Representations and Purchaser Fundamental
Representations will survive for a period of 24 months from the Closing Date.
Fraud claims shall survive until 90 days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, taking into account any tolling periods or
extensions. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims for
indemnification for which a Claim Notice has been delivered by the Person
seeking indemnification to the Person from whom indemnification is sought
before the expiration of the applicable survival period will not thereafter be
barred by the expiration of the relevant representation or warranty and such
claims will survive until finally resolved. All covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement shall survive in accordance with their respective
terms or until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, as
applicable at which point they shall terminate.

 _Section 10.6_ _Limitations on Liability_.

(a) With respect to the Sellers' indemnification obligations, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

(i) Except in the case of fraud or a breach of a Seller Fundamental
Representation, the Sellers shall not have any obligation to indemnify any
Purchaser Indemnified Party under _Section 10.1(a)_ unless and until the
aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be subject to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)_ exceeds $1,168,750 (the "Deductible Amount"),
whereupon the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to receive the
aggregate amount of Losses from the first Dollar, regardless of the Deductible
Amount;

(ii) Except in the case of fraud or a breach of a Seller Fundamental
Representation or of the representations and warranties contained in _Section
3.15_ , and subject to the other limitations in this _Section 10.6_ , in no
event shall the cumulative indemnification obligations of the Sellers under
_Section 10.1(a)_ in the aggregate exceed $10,000,000 (the "Cap") and in no
event shall the indemnification obligations of each Seller under _Section
10.1(a)_ exceed such Seller's _pro rata_ percentage of the amount of Losses
that would otherwise be subject to indemnification pursuant to _Section
10.1(a)_ (in each case based on the applicable percentage of the Estimated
Purchase Price to which such Seller is entitled as set forth on the Member
Allocation Schedule.

(b) Subject to the other limitations set forth herein, with respect to any
Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnified Party that would be subject to
_Section 10.1(a)_ , if any portion of such Losses is not expressly excluded by
the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy, then such Purchaser Indemnified Party
shall use reasonable best efforts (which shall not include the obligation to
commence litigation) to recover such portion under the RandW Insurance Policy
prior to receiving payment for any claim against the Sellers hereunder for
such portion; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser
Indemnified Party is not required to assert any claims against the RandW
Insurance Policy to the extent such claims are expressly excluded by the terms
of the RandW Insurance Policy. Any claims that are expressly excluded from the
RandW Insurance Policy and any claims that are otherwise not recoverable under
the RandW Insurance Policy after the Purchaser Indemnified Party has satisfied
its obligations in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to be
"Excluded Claims."

(c) Subject to the other limitations imposed by this _ARTICLE 10_ including
the Deductible Amount and the Cap (to the extent applicable): ​

(i) all indemnification claims under _Section 10.1(a)_ (other than Excluded
Claims and any claims as a result of a breach of any of the Seller Fundamental
Representations or the representations and warranties in _Section 3.15_ (
_Taxes_ )): (A) shall first be paid and satisfied from the Escrow Account; and
(B) shall then be paid and satisfied exclusively from the RandW Insurance
Policy;

(ii) all indemnification claims under _Section 10.1(a)_ that are Excluded
Claims (other than claims as a result of a breach of any of the Seller
Fundamental Representations or the representations and warranties in _Section
3.15_ ( _Taxes_ )): (A) shall first be paid and satisfied from the Escrow
Account; and (B) shall then be paid and satisfied directly from the Sellers,
severally and not jointly, but subject to the Cap; and

(iii) all indemnification claims under _Section 10.1(a)_ as a result of a
breach of any of the Seller Fundamental Representations or the representations
and warranties in _Section 3.15_ ( _Taxes_ )): (A) shall first be paid and
satisfied from the Escrow Account; (B) to the extent such claims are not
Excluded Claims, shall then be paid and satisfied from the RandW Insurance
Policy, and (C) to the extent such claims are Excluded Claims or to the extent
the underlying Losses of such claims exceed the amounts recoverable under the
RandW Insurance Policy, shall then be paid and satisfied directly from the
Sellers, severally and not jointly. With respect to claims by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party for Losses with respect to breaches of any of the Seller
Fundamental Representations or the representations and warranties in _Section
3.15_ ( _Taxes_ ), in no event may the Purchaser Indemnified Parties seek
recourse against the Sellers for an aggregate amount in excess of the Purchase
Price, with any and all indemnification payments made by the Sellers taken
into consideration when determining whether such cap has been met.

(d) With respect to the Purchaser's indemnification obligations,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

(i) Except in the case of fraud or a breach of a Purchaser Fundamental
Representation, the Purchaser shall not have any obligation to indemnify the
Sellers under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of
Losses that would otherwise be subject to indemnification pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)(i)_ exceeds the Deductible Amount, whereupon the Sellers shall be
entitled to receive the aggregate amount of Losses from the first Dollar,
regardless of the Deductible Amount; and

(ii) Except in the case of fraud or a breach of a Purchaser Fundamental
Representation, in no event shall the cumulative indemnification obligations
of the Purchaser under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ in the aggregate exceed the Cap.

For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification obligations of the Purchaser
for any nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or agreement in
_Article VII_ by the Purchaser shall not be subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Section 10.6(d)_.

 _Section 10.7_ _No Right of Indemnification or Contribution_. No Seller has
any right of indemnification or contribution against the Company with respect
to any breach by the Sellers or the Company of any of their representations,
warranties, statements, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or other document
delivered by or on behalf of any Seller or the Company pursuant to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, whether by virtue of any contractual or
statutory right of indemnity or otherwise, and all claims to the contrary are
hereby waived and released. ​

 _Section 10.8_ _Tax Refunds, Insurance Proceeds and Other Payments_. The
amount of any and all Losses for which indemnification is provided pursuant to
this _ARTICLE 10_ will be net of (i) any Tax benefit actually received by the
applicable Indemnified Party in the current taxable period or year (taking
into account any Tax cost or reduction in Tax benefit by reason of the receipt
of the indemnification payment) and (ii) any amounts of any insurance
proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements
receivable by, or payable in kind to, the Indemnified Party with respect to
such Losses or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto. In connection
therewith, if, at any time following payment in full by the Indemnifying Party
of any amounts of Losses due under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party
receives any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution
payments or reimbursements relating to the circumstances giving rise to such
Losses, the Indemnified Party will promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party
such proceeds, payments or reimbursements in an amount not to exceed the
amount of the corresponding indemnification payment made by the Indemnifying
Party. The Purchaser will use (and will cause its Affiliates to use)
reasonable best efforts to mitigate any Loss and to collect the proceeds of
any available insurance which would have the effect of reducing any Losses (in
which case the net proceeds thereof will reduce the Losses). The Purchaser
agrees that until the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date
it shall maintain casualty and liability insurance policies, employment
practices liability insurance, and other insurance policies in each case, such
policies being substantially equivalent in coverage, coverage amount, quality
of carrier, and covered claims to the insurance policies maintained by the
Company immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 _Section 10.9_ _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Purchaser against the Sellers for any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement (other than claims
or causes of action arising from intentional fraud or willful misconduct) will
be pursuant to the indemnification obligations set forth in this _ARTICLE 10_
and, except to the extent the Purchaser has asserted a claim for
indemnification by giving a Claim Notice in accordance with _Section 10.3_ or
_Section 10.4_ prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set
forth in _Section 10.5_ , the Purchaser will have no remedy against the
Sellers for any breach of any provision of this Agreement. Each of the Sellers
and the Purchaser hereby waives any and all other remedies (other than claims
or causes of action arising from intentional fraud or willful misconduct) that
may be available at Law or equity for any breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein will limit (a) the right of the Purchaser to assert a claim
against the RandW Insurance Policy or (b) the right of any party to seek
injunctive or equitable relief for any breach or threatened breach of any
covenant in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

 _Section 10.10_ _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments._ Any payment
under this _ARTICLE 10_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the purchase
price for Tax purposes.

 _Section 10.11_ _Sellers ' Release_. Effective as of the Closing, except
with respect to any claim, right or obligation under this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, each of the Sellers, as a member, manager,
employee, officer, or director of, or as a holder of Membership Interests in,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise, and on behalf of itself,
its Affiliates, and the successors and assigns of each of them, hereby
irrevocably waives, releases, remises, and forever discharges the Company, its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective past, present and future members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, equityholders, Subsidiaries, and
Affiliates, and the successors and assigns of each of them, from any and all
Liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries owed to such Seller, any of
its Affiliates, or any successor or assign of any of them or any claims,
actions or Liabilities of any kind which such Seller, any of its Affiliates,
or any successor or assign of any of them currently have against, or which are
in any way connected to, the Company to the extent arising on or prior to the
Closing and related to such Seller's ownership of the Membership Interests,
services provided to the Company or other contractual relationship with the
Company, in each case whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
absolute or contingent, direct or indirect or nominally or beneficially
possessed or claimed by such Seller, any of its ​

Affiliates, or any successor or assign of any of them. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the foregoing does not waive or release the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from any obligation to indemnify a Seller in his capacity as an
employee, officer or manager of the Company pursuant to the Governing
Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any applicable Laws.
Each releasing party hereunder represents and warrants that there has been no
assignment or other transfer of any interest in any claim released pursuant to
_Section 11.5_.

 _Section 10.12_ _Purchaser 's Release_. Effective as of the Closing, the
Purchaser and the Parent, each on behalf of itself and its successors and
assigns, hereby irrevocably waives, releases, remises, and forever discharges
the Sellers and each of their respective past, present and future members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, equityholders, and the successors
and assigns of each of them (the "Released Parties"), from any and all claims,
actions or Liabilities of any kind which the Purchaser or the Parent, or any
successor or assign of either of them currently have against the Sellers, or
which are in any way connected to, the Company to the extent arising on or
prior to the Closing and related to (i) any failure by the Company or any
Subsidiary or Prediktive LLC to withhold or pay any income, payroll, social
security, social contribution or other Tax with respect to the personnel
provided by Prediktive LLC under that certain Master Services Agreement
entered into by the Company and Prediktive LLC effective August 20, 2018, or
to file any Tax Return relating to such Taxes; or (ii) any failure by the
Company or any Subsidiary or Prediktive LLC to collect and remit any sales,
use, value added, good and services and/or other consumption or excise Taxes,
or file any Tax Return relating to such Taxes, with any state within the
United States, in any such case whether known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, absolute or contingent, direct or indirect or nominally or
beneficially possessed or claimed by Purchaser, any of its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Subsidiaries), or any successor or assign of
any of them. The Purchaser hereunder represents and warrants that there has
been no assignment or other transfer of any interest in any claim, action or
Liabilities released pursuant to _Section 11.5_. The Purchaser and the
Parent, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Released Parties against any such claims, actions and Liabilities released
pursuant to this _Section 10.12_.

 _Section 10.13_ _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding the fact that any
Indemnified Party may have the right to assert claims for indemnification
under or in respect of more than one provision of this Agreement in respect of
any fact, event, condition or circumstance, no Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to recover the amount of any Losses suffered by such Person more than
once from an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement, regardless of
whether such Losses may be as a result of a breach of more than one
representation or warranty or covenant.

extension or waiver by any party to this Agreement will be valid only if set
forth in a written document signed on behalf of the party or parties against
whom the waiver or extension is to be effective. No extension or waiver will
apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty, or noncompliance with any covenant, agreement or condition, as the
case may be, other than that which is specified in the written extension or
waiver. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right or remedy
under this Agreement or any of the documents delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, and no course ​

of dealing between the parties, operates as a waiver of such right or remedy,
and no single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy precludes any
other or further exercise of such right or remedy or the exercise of any other
right or remedy. Any enumeration of a party's rights and remedies in this
Agreement is not intended to be exclusive, and a party's rights and remedies
are intended to be cumulative to the extent permitted by Law and include any
rights and remedies authorized in Law or in equity.

 _Section 11.4_ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules
and Exhibits and the documents and instruments referred to in this Agreement
that are to be delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement
among the parties and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties, or any of them, written or oral, with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

 _Section 11.5_ _Assignment and Successors and No Third Party Rights_. This
Agreement binds and benefits the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations
under this Agreement shall be assignable or transferable by any Party without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller Representative;
provided however, that nothing herein shall prohibit the Purchaser from
assigning and transferring all or part of this Agreement and any of its rights
thereunder to one of its Affiliates; provided that the Purchaser provides the
Seller Representative written notice of such assignment and any such assignor
remains jointly and severally bound with such assignee by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so assigned. Nothing expressed or referred to in
this Agreement will be construed to give any Person, other than the parties to
this Agreement, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement except such
rights as may inure to a successor or permitted assignee under this Section.

 _Section 11.6_ _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions of this Agreement are not affected or impaired in
any way and the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such
invalid, illegal and unenforceable provision with a valid, legal and
enforceable provision that achieves, to the greatest lawful extent under this
Agreement, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision.

 _Section 11.7_ _Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits and Schedules to this
Agreement (including the Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule) are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of
this Agreement. The Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule are arranged in sections and paragraphs corresponding to the numbered
and lettered sections and paragraphs of _ARTICLE 3_ and _ARTICLE 5_ , as
applicable. The disclosure in any section or paragraph of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule qualifies other
sections and paragraphs in this Agreement only to the extent it is clear by
appropriate cross-references that a given disclosure is applicable to such
other sections and paragraphs. The listing or inclusion of a copy of a
document or other item is not adequate to disclose an exception to any
representation or warranty in this Agreement unless the representation or
warranty relates to the existence of the document or item itself. Inclusion of
information in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule
shall not be construed as an admission that such information is material to
the business, operations, or condition (financial or otherwise) of the
Business, the Company, or the Purchaser, taken in part or as a whole, or as an
admission of liability or obligation to any third party. Any item of
information, matter, or document disclosed or referenced in, or attached to,
the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule or Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not (a)
be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material," "Material Adverse
Effect," or other similar terms in this Agreement or to establish a standard
of materiality, (b) be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of any
Party's representations and warranties, obligations, covenants, conditions, or
agreements contained herein, (c) constitute, or be deemed to constitute, an
admission of liability or obligation regarding such matter, or (d) constitute,
or be deemed to constitute, an admission to any third party concerning such
item or matter. No ​

disclosure in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement or Law
shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred.

 _Section 11.8_ _Interpretation_. In the negotiation of this Agreement, each
party has received advice from his or its own attorney. The language used in
this Agreement is the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual
intent, and no provision of this Agreement will be interpreted for or against
any party because that party or its attorney drafted the provision.

 _Section 11.9_ _Governing Law_. Unless any Exhibit or Schedule specifies a
different choice of Law, the internal Laws of the State of Delaware (without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of Laws of any other jurisdiction) govern all matters arising out
of or relating to this Agreement and its Exhibits and Schedules and all of the
transactions it contemplates, including its validity, interpretation,
construction, performance and enforcement and any disputes or controversies
arising therefrom or related thereto.

 _Section 11.10_ _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. The parties accordingly agree that, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, the parties are entitled to
injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and otherwise to
enforce specifically the provisions of this Agreement. Each party expressly
waives any requirement that any other party obtain any bond or provide any
indemnity in connection with any action seeking injunctive relief or specific
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement.

 _Section 11.11_ _Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. Any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement must be brought in the courts of the Delaware
Court of Chancery, or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have
jurisdiction, any other federal or state court in the State of Delaware. Each
of the parties knowingly, voluntarily and irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of each such court in any such action or proceeding and waives
any objection it may now or hereafter have to venue or to convenience of
forum. Any party to this Agreement may make service on another party by
sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the
address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section
11.1_. Nothing in this _Section 11.11_ , however, affects the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 _Section 11.12_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties knowingly,
voluntarily and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether
based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of
any party to this Agreement in negotiation, administration, performance or
enforcement of this Agreement.

 _Section 11.13_ _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other
hand, will pay all of their own expenses (including, but not limited to, all
compensation and expenses of counsel, financial advisors, consultants,
actuaries and independent accountants) incurred in connection with the
preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that the Sellers will
bear all Transaction Expenses of the Company, which the Purchaser will pay on
behalf of the Sellers and/or the Company as provided in _Section 2.5(d)_. _Section 11.14_ _Counterparts_. The parties may execute this Agreement in
multiple counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the
party that signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement.
This Agreement is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from
each party to the other parties. The signatures of all parties need not
appear on the same counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by email
transmission in portable document format or .tiff format that includes a copy
of the sending party's signature(s) is as effective as signing and delivering
the counterpart in person.

[Signature page follows.] The parties have executed and delivered this Agreement as of the date
indicated in the first sentence of this Agreement.
