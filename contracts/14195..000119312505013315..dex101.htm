liable for any such deficiency. To the extent any amounts remain on deposit in
the Escrow Account after payment of any such deficit, the Buyers and
the Sellers shall deliver a written notice to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to pay any such amount remaining on deposit in the Escrow
Account plus accrued interest on such amount (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds) to the Sellers. Any disbursements from the Escrow Account

following demand from the Buyers. Briggs Canada, at its own expense, shall

taxes. If current years tax bills are available, the prorations will be based
upon such current years actual tax bills. If current years tax bills are not
available, the prorations shall be based upon the prior years tax bills.
When the current years tax bills are available, the prorations will be
adjusted based on such current years tax bills and the provisions of this
_Section 7.8(c)_. Sellers or Buyers, as the case may be, shall reimburse the
other for any difference between the prorations determined at the Closing
based upon the prior years tax bills and any adjustments determined under the
preceding sentence based upon the current years actual tax bills. The Buyers
shall be responsible for remitting the full amount of such personal property
ad valorem tax relating to the Acquired Assets for such Straddle Period to the
relevant Tax Authority.

the Transition Supply Agreement, in accordance with its terms, at which time
the Transition Period Contracts shall be deemed rejected by the Sellers
pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, _provided_ , _however_ , that

amicably resolve product liability, warranty and similar claims as part of the
Buyers overall business relationship with the retailers who owe such
Accounts Receivable. Sellers, however, agree that nothing in this _Section

product warranty litigation.

the reasonable fees and expenses (including, attorneys fees and financial
advisory fees) of the Buyers in an amount not to exceed $1,000,000 (the " _
_Expense Reimbursement__ ", and together with the Liquidated Damages, the " _
_Buyer Protection Fees__ ").



(ii) Pursuant to section 364(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Buyer
Protection Fees shall be allowed administrative claims in Murrays chapter 11
case and shall have priority over any and all administrative expenses of the
kinds specified in sections 503(b), 506(c), 507(a) or 507(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer Protection Fees shall
be fully subordinated in right of prior payment in full in cash to, and only
to, (x) the carve-out for professionals set forth in the Financing Order, (y)
all "Obligations" from time to time owing by the Sellers to the Pre-Petition
Secured Lenders under and as defined in the Pre-Petition Credit Agreement and
(z) all "Obligations" from time to time owing by the Sellers to the Post-
Petition Secured Lenders under and as defined in the Post-Petition Credit
Agreement.



 

61 (c) _Effect of Termination; Release of the Earnest Money Deposit_.



(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Sellers under this Agreement shall be limited to
amounts on deposit in the Escrow Account with respect to the Earnest Money
Deposit. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ the
Buyers and the Sellers shall deliver a written notice within two (2) Business
Days of such termination instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the Earnest Money
Deposit plus accrued interest thereon to the Sellers by wire transfer
of immediately available funds.



(ii) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ , in addition to the Buyers rights (if any) to the Buyer
Protection Fees provided in this Agreement, the Buyers and the Sellers shall
deliver a written notice, within two (2) Business Days of such termination
instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the Earnest Money Deposit plus accrued
interest thereon to the Buyers by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that the
distribution to the Buyers of any funds on deposit in the Escrow Account shall
not reduce, modify or eliminate the Buyers rights (if any) to receive the
Buyer Protection Fees.



(d) _Survival_. The Sellers obligations to pay the Buyer Protection Fees,
and all other obligations of the Sellers specified in _Section 9.2_ shall
survive the termination of this Agreement. The parties to this Agreement
acknowledge and agree that (i) the payment of the Buyer Protection Fees
as provided in this Agreement is an essential element of the Buyers and
Sellers decision to enter into this Agreement and (ii) the amount of the
Buyer Protection Fees are fair and reasonable and do not constitute a penalty.
