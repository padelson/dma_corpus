Working Capital as of the Closing Date (i) as shown in the BuyersÂ’
calculation in the Closing Date Working Capital Statement delivered pursuant
to _Section 3.3(a)(ii)_ above if no notice of disagreement with respect

payment for any such deficiency and in no event shall the Sellers be otherwise
liable for any such deficiency. To the extent any amounts remain on deposit in
the Escrow Account after payment of any such deficit, the Buyers and
the Sellers shall deliver a written notice to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to pay any such amount remaining on deposit in the Escrow
Account plus accrued interest on such amount (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds) to the Sellers. Any disbursements from the Escrow Account

other than as permitted in writing by the Buyers, preserve in all material
respects the Business, and (iii) preserve, in all material respects, the

time on or after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall, at their own expense,

Sales Tax Act (Ontario) (collectively, " _ _Transfer Taxes__ ") incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne
by the Sellers. Briggs Canada shall provide Murray Canada with a Purchase
Exemption Certificate in accordance with the Retail Sales Act (Ontario) in
respect of any tangible assets purchased for resale. If (x) after the Canadian
Tax Elections and any other tax election the Buyers may reasonably request an
exemption to the GST Tax is not available and (y) the GST Tax is required to
be remitted to the applicable Canadian Tax Authority in connection with the
consummation of this transaction, then Briggs Canada shall bear the GST Tax
subject to Briggs Canada being entitled to apply and receive an input tax
credit for the GST Tax paid by Briggs Canada (the " _ _Buyers Â’ GST
Obligation__"). If payment of any Transfer Tax is required to be paid by
either Buyer and such Tax was not previously deducted from the
Purchase Price, then the Sellers shall put the Buyers in full and clear funds
to enable such Buyer to make payment of such liability as soon as practicable
following demand from the Buyers. Briggs Canada, at its own expense, shall
file the Canadian Tax Elections with respect to the BuyersÂ’ GST Obligation.
The Sellers shall, at their own expense, file all other necessary Tax Returns,
Canadian Tax Elections and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer

or Canadian Tax Elections. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Murray U.S. shall
seek in the Sale Order a decretal paragraph which provides that, in accordance
with Section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, the sale of the U.S. Acquired
Assets contemplated hereby is a step in the formulation, or anticipation of
the formulation, of a Chapter 11 plan for Murray U.S. and, as such, the making

Buyers a credit against the purchase price for) SellersÂ’ portion of such
taxes. If current yearÂ’s tax bills are available, the prorations will be based
upon such current yearÂ’s actual tax bills. If current yearÂ’s tax bills are not
available, the prorations shall be based upon the prior yearÂ’s tax bills.
When the current yearÂ’s tax bills are available, the prorations will be
adjusted based on such current yearÂ’s tax bills and the provisions of this
_Section 7.8(c)_. Sellers or Buyers, as the case may be, shall reimburse the
other for any difference between the prorations determined at the Closing
based upon the prior yearÂ’s tax bills and any adjustments determined under the

amicably resolve product liability, warranty and similar claims as part of the
BuyersÂ’ overall business relationship with the retailers who owe such
Accounts Receivable. Sellers, however, agree that nothing in this _Section

Agreement, in the event that (i) the sale to the Buyers does not close by
March 15, 2005 because a closing condition set forth within this Agreement is
not met, (ii) such closing condition was within the control of either of the
Sellers, and (iii) the Buyers elect to terminate this Agreement, then the
Buyers shall have earned liquidated damages and not as a penalty the amount of
$3,000,000 (the " _ _Liquidated Damages_ "_), and reimbursement of
the reasonable fees and expenses (including, attorneys fees and financial
advisory fees) of the Buyers in an amount not to exceed $1,000,000 (the " _
_Expense Reimbursement__ ", and together with the Liquidated Damages, the " _
_Buyer Protection Fees__ ").



(ii) Pursuant to section 364(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Buyer
Protection Fees shall be allowed administrative claims in MurrayÂ’s chapter 11
case and shall have priority over any and all administrative expenses of the
kinds specified in sections 503(b), 506(c), 507(a) or 507(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer Protection Fees shall
be fully subordinated in right of prior payment in full in cash to, and only
to, (x) the carve-out for professionals set forth in the Financing Order, (y)
all "Obligations" from time to time owing by the Sellers to the Pre-Petition
Secured Lenders under and as defined in the Pre-Petition Credit Agreement and
(z) all "Obligations" from time to time owing by the Sellers to the Post-
Petition Secured Lenders under and as defined in the Post-Petition Credit
Agreement.



 

61 (c) _Effect of Termination; Release of the Earnest Money Deposit_.



(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Sellers under this Agreement shall be limited to
amounts on deposit in the Escrow Account with respect to the Earnest Money
Deposit. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ the
Buyers and the Sellers shall deliver a written notice within two (2) Business
Days of such termination instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the Earnest Money
Deposit plus accrued interest thereon to the Sellers by wire transfer
of immediately available funds.



(ii) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ , in addition to the BuyersÂ’ rights (if any) to the Buyer
Protection Fees provided in this Agreement, the Buyers and the Sellers shall
deliver a written notice, within two (2) Business Days of such termination
instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the Earnest Money Deposit plus accrued
interest thereon to the Buyers by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that the
distribution to the Buyers of any funds on deposit in the Escrow Account shall
not reduce, modify or eliminate the BuyersÂ’ rights (if any) to receive the
Buyer Protection Fees.



(d) _Survival_. The SellersÂ’ obligations to pay the Buyer Protection Fees,
and all other obligations of the Sellers specified in _Section 9.2_ shall
survive the termination of this Agreement. The parties to this Agreement
acknowledge and agree that (i) the payment of the Buyer Protection Fees
as provided in this Agreement is an essential element of the BuyersÂ’ and
SellersÂ’ decision to enter into this Agreement and (ii) the amount of the
Buyer Protection Fees are fair and reasonable and do not constitute a penalty.
