(a) Each  share of Company Capital Stock that is held in the treasury of the
Company  and  each share of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent, Merger
Sub or any other  wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and
retired and no  consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

(b) Subject  to _Section 2.8_ , _Section 3.1_ and _Article X_ , each share
of  Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective  Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled in
accordance  with _Section 2.6(a)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted  at the Effective Time into the right to receive an amount in cash
(adjusted  to  the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the
quotient of (i) (1)  $188,000,000 (One Hundred Eighty Eight Million Dollars)
(the " _Merger  Consideration_ "), _plus_ (2) the Closing Cash, _plus_ (3)
the  Aggregate Exercise Price, _plus_ (4) fifty percent (50%) of the amount,
if  any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the
Targeted  Net  Working Capital Amount (such result, the " _Estimated Net

Number (such  result, the " _Per Share Common Merger Consideration_ "). All
such  shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be

of  a Company Certificate representing any such shares of Company Common
Stock  shall  cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive,  subject to _Section 2.8_ , _Section 3.1_ and _Article X_ ,
the Per  Share Common Merger Consideration with respect to such shares of
Company Common  Stock upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance
with _Section  3.1_. The Targeted Net Working Capital Amount (A) _plus_ the

have  been convertible immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied_
by  (ii) the Per Share Common Merger Consideration (the " _Per Share
Preferred  Merger Consideration_ ," and together with the Per Share Common
Merger  Consideration, the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). All such 
shares of Company Preferred Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be 
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired, and each holder

that is outstanding as of the Effective Time (whether  then vested or
unvested) and that has not been exercised prior to the Effective  Time shall
be cancelled in consideration of payment to the holder thereof (each,  an "

multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable  upon the exercise of each unexercised Company Option held by such
Optionholder  as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (ii) the
excess, if any,  of  (x) the Per Share Common Merger Consideration less (y)
the exercise price per  share of such Company Option (such amount an "
_Option  Payment_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take 
all necessary actions, including providing any required notice to
Optionholders,  necessary to effect the transactions described in this
_Section 2.7_   pursuant to the terms of the Company Option Plan and any
agreement evidencing  a  Company Option.

 

 

SECTION  2.8 _Post-Closing  Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

 

(a) _Estimated  Purchase Price_. Not later than three days before the
Closing, the  Company shall deliver to Parent and the Equityholders'
Representative a  certificate of the Company executed on its behalf by the
Chief Financial Officer  of the Company that sets forth in reasonable detail
the Company's estimates of  the Closing Net Working Capital Amount (the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital  Amount_ "), Closing Cash (" _Estimated
Closing Cash_ "), Closing Debt  (" _Estimated Closing Debt_ ") and Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses  (" _Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction

Company Transaction Expenses upon which the Per Share  Merger Consideration
to be paid at Closing shall be based.

 

 

(b) _Calculation_.  As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 90
days following the  Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall, at its
expense, (i) cause to  be  prepared, in accordance with GAAP, using the
policies, conventions,  methodologies and procedures used by the Company in
preparing the Company  Financial Statements, an unaudited balance sheet of
the Company on or prior  to  the close of business on the Closing Date, but
which shall not reflect or give  effect to the transactions occurring at the
Closing (the " _Closing Balance  Sheet_ "), together with a statement (the "
_Closing Date Schedule_ ")  setting forth in reasonable detail the Surviving
Corporation's calculation of  the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing
Cash, Closing Debt and Unpaid  Company Transaction Expenses and (ii) deliver
to the Equityholders' Representative the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Date  Schedule.

 

 

(c) _Review;  Disputes_.

 

 

(i) From  and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
provide the  Equityholders' Representative and any accountants or advisors
retained by the  Equityholders' Representative with reasonable access, during
normal business  hours, to the relevant books and records of the Surviving
Corporation used  by  the Surviving Corporation in the preparation of, or
otherwise reasonably  relevant to, the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Date Schedule for the  purposes of: (A) enabling the Equityholders'
Representative and its accountants  and advisors to calculate, and to review
the Surviving Corporation's calculation  of, the Closing Net Working Capital
Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and  Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses;
and (B) identifying any dispute related  to  the calculation of any of the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash,  Closing Debt and Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses in the Closing Balance  Sheet and the Closing
Date Schedule. The reasonable fees and expenses  of any such accountants and
advisors retained by the Equityholders' Representative shall be paid by the
Equityholders' Representative from the  Equityholders' Representative Expense
Fund.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) If  the Equityholders' Representative disputes the calculation of any of
the Closing  Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt or Unpaid
Company  Transaction Expenses set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet or the
Closing  Date  Schedule, then the Equityholders' Representative shall
deliver a written notice  (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to the Surviving
Corporation and the Escrow Agent at  any time during the 40-day period
commencing upon receipt by the Equityholders' Representative of the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Schedule,  all  as prepared by the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with the requirements  of  _Section
2.8(b)_ (the " _Review Period_ "). The Dispute  Notice shall set forth the
basis for the dispute of any such calculation in  reasonable detail.

 

 

(iii) If  the Equityholders' Representative does not deliver a Dispute Notice
to the  Surviving Corporation prior to the expiration of the Review Period,
the  Surviving Corporation's calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital
Amount,  Closing Cash, Closing Debt and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses
set forth  in  the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Schedule shall
be deemed final  and binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Equityholders' Representative and the Equityholders for all purposes of
this  Agreement.

 

 

(iv) If  the Equityholders' Representative delivers a Dispute Notice to the
Surviving  Corporation prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then
the  Equityholders' Representative and the Surviving Corporation shall use 
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the Closing Net
Working  Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and Unpaid Company
Transaction  Expenses. If the Equityholders' Representative and the
Surviving  Corporation are unable to reach agreement on the Closing Net
Working Capital  Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses  within 30 days after the end of the Review Period,
either party shall have  the  right to refer such dispute to Ernst and Young
LLP or an alternative national  accounting firm reasonably agreed to by the
Equityholders' Representative and  Parent (such firm, or any successor
thereto, being referred to herein as the  " _Accounting Firm_ ") after such
30th day. In connection with the  resolution of any such dispute by the
Accounting Firm: (i) each of the Surviving  Corporation and the
Equityholders' Representative shall have a reasonable  opportunity to meet
with the Accounting Firm to provide their views as to any  disputed issues
with respect to the calculation of any of the Closing Net  Working Capital
Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and Unpaid Company  Transaction Expenses;
(ii) the Accounting Firm shall determine the Closing  Net  Working Capital
Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and Unpaid Company  Transaction Expenses
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement within  30  days of such
referral and upon reaching such determination shall deliver a  copy  of its
calculations (the " _Expert Calculations_ ") to the
Equityholders' Representative, Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent;
and (iii)  the  determination made by the Accounting Firm of the Closing Net
Working Capital  Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses  shall  be final and binding on Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Equityholders' Representative and the Equityholders for all
purposes of this Agreement, absent  manifest error. In calculating the
Closing Net Working Capital  Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt and Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses,  the  Accounting Firm (i) shall be limited to
addressing any particular disputes  referred to in the Dispute Notice and
(ii) such calculation shall, with respect  to any disputed item, be no
greater than the higher amount calculated by the  Equityholders'
Representative or the Surviving Corporation, and no less than the  lower
amount calculated by the Equityholders' Representative or the Surviving 
Corporation, as the case may be. The Expert Calculations shall reflect in
detail  the differences, if any, between the Closing Net Working Capital
Amount, Closing  Cash, Closing Debt and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses
reflected therein  and  the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing
Cash, Closing Debt and Unpaid  Company Transaction Expenses set forth in the
Closing Balance Sheet and Closing  Date Schedule. The fees and expenses of
the Accounting Firm shall be  borne equally by the Surviving Corporation and
the Equityholders' Representative  (it being understood that any fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm payable  by the Equityholders' Representative
shall be payable from the Equityholders' Representative Expense Fund).

(d) _Payment  Upon Final Determination of Adjustments._

 

 

(i) If  (A) the sum of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount and Closing
Cash,  _less_ Closing Debt and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, as
finally  determined in accordance with Section 2.8(c), is less than (B) the
sum of the  Adjusted Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, as calculated in
accordance  with  _Section 2.6(b)_ , and Estimated Closing Cash, _less_
Estimated Closing  Debt and Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, as
finally estimated  in  accordance with _Section 2.8(a)_ , then the Surviving
Corporation shall  receive the amount of such deficiency (the " _Working
Capital Shortfall_ ")  from the Equityholders (it being understood that up to
$500,000 of the Working  Capital Shortfall payable by the Equityholders shall
be payable from the Escrow  Fund (unless Parent consents to payment of a
greater amount from the Escrow  Fund) and that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall direct the Escrow  Agent  to pay the Working Capital
Shortfall, up to such amount, from the Escrow Fund  in  accordance with the
Escrow Agreement), no later than two (2) business days  after  such
determination.

 

 

(ii) If  (A) the sum of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount and Closing
Cash,  _less_ Closing Debt and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, as
finally  determined in accordance with _Section 2.8(c)_ , _is greater than_
(B)  the sum of the Adjusted Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, as
calculated  in  accordance with _Section 2.6(b)_ , and Estimated Closing
Cash, _less_   Estimated Closing Debt and Estimated Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses, as  finally estimated in accordance with _Section
2.8(a)_ , then the Surviving  Corporation shall, no later than two Business
Days after such determination  (or,  if such Equityholder has not exchanged
such Equityholder's Company Certificates  pursuant to _Article III_ , then
upon such exchange by such Equityholder),  cause to be paid to each
Equityholder by delivery of immediately available  funds  to such
Equityholder an amount equal to the product of such excess (from dollar  one)
multiplied by such Equityholder's Applicable Percentage.

 

 

**ARTICLE  III.**

SECTION  3.1 _Exchange of Company  Certificates_.

 

 

(a) _Payment_. At  the Closing, (i) each Equityholder shall deliver to the
Surviving Corporation  for cancellation the stock certificates and/or

and Company Options  (collectively, such Equityholder's " _Company
Certificates_ ") together with  an executed and completed copy of the letter
of transmittal referred to in  _Section 3.1(b)_ , (ii) subject to _Section
2.8_ and _Article X_ ,  Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay the aggregate  amount to be paid to Equityholders pursuant

in a form agreed  upon  by Parent and the Company prior to the execution of
this Agreement, and  surrender of Company Certificates for cancellation,
except that (x) the sum  of  ten million dollars ($10,000,000) (the "
_Escrow Fund_ ") shall be deducted,  _pro rata_ in proportion to each
Equityholder's Applicable Percentage,  from such aggregate amount and
delivered to U.S. Bank, N.A. or an alternative  nationally recognized banking
corporation reasonably agreed to by the  Equityholders' Representative and
Parent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") to hold in  accordance with the terms of the
escrow agreement to be executed at Closing  by  Parent, the Escrow Agent and
the Equityholders' Representative in the form  attached hereto as _Exhibit B_
(the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") and  (y) an amount specified in writing by the
Equityholders' Representative to  Parent no later than two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date (the " _Equityholders ' Representative Expense_
_Fund_ ") shall be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deducted,  _pro rata_ in proportion to each Equityholder's Applicable

Parent shall, or  shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deliver the
Escrow Fund to the Escrow  Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and the
Equityholders' Representative  Expense Fund to the Equityholders'
Representative.

 

 

(b) _Exchange  Procedures_. To the extent that an Equityholder has not
delivered  the Company Certificates representing all of such Equityholder's
shares of  Company Capital Stock or Company Options as of the Closing, then,
promptly  after  the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall mail to
such Equityholder:  (i) a letter of transmittal (in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent and  the Surviving Corporation), which shall (x) specify
that the delivery of the  consideration to be paid to such Equityholder under
this Agreement shall be  effected, and risk of loss and title to Company
Capital Stock and Company  Options held by such Equityholder shall pass, only
upon delivery of the  applicable Company Certificates, (y) contain
representations and warranties  as  to ownership and title to such Company
Capital Stock or Company Options and  (z)  require delivery of appropriate
and customary certifications as to tax status,  and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of each Company  Certificate in exchange for the
amount to be paid to such Equityholder pursuant  to _Section 2.6_ and
_Section 2.7_. Upon surrender of a  Company Certificate for cancellation to
the Surviving Corporation, together  with  such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance  with the instructions thereto,
the Company Certificates so surrendered shall  forthwith be canceled, and the
holder of the Company Certificate shall be  entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, subject to _Section 3.1(a)_ and  _Article X_ , the consideration
payable to such holder pursuant to  _Section 2.6_ and/or _Section 2.7_ , as
the case may be, without  interest thereon, as such amounts may be adjusted
pursuant to _Section  2.8_. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Company
Certificate  shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes,  to evidence only the right to receive the payments
pursuant to _Section  2.6_ and/or _Section 2.7_ , as such amounts may be
adjusted pursuant to  _Section 2.8_.

 

 

(c) _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Company Certificates_. If any Company 
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon (i) the making 
of an  affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate
to be  lost, stolen or destroyed and (ii) the execution and delivery to the
Surviving  Corporation by such Person of an indemnity agreement in customary
form and  substance or, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting  by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation  may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with  respect to such Company Certificate, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall,  subject to _Section 3.1(a)_ and _Article X_ ,
issue, in exchange for  such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate,
the amount of cash, without  interest, that such Person would have been
entitled to receive had such Person  surrendered such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Certificate to the Surviving  Corporation pursuant to
_Section 2.6(b)_ , _Section 2.6(c)_ , _Section  2.6(d)_ or _Section 2.7_ , as
such amounts may be adjusted pursuant to  _Section 2.8_.

 

 

(d) _No  Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
_Section 3.1_ , neither the Company, Parent nor the Surviving Corporation 
shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official  pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 

SECTION  3.2 _Dissenting  Shares_. Notwithstanding  any  provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL, but only  to the extent
required thereby, shares of Company Capital Stock which are issued  and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held  by 
holders of such shares of Company Capital Stock who have properly exercised 
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting  Shares_ ") shall not be  exchangeable for the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, and  holders of such shares of Company
Capital Stock shall be entitled to receive  payment of the appraised value of
such shares of Company Capital Stock in  accordance with the provisions of
the DGCL unless and until such holders fail  to  perfect or effectively
withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment  under the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect  or effectively
withdraws

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  loses such right, such shares of  Company Capital Stock shall thereupon
be treated as if they had been converted  into and to have become
exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right  to  receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, without any interest  thereon. The Company shall
give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice  of any written demands for
appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal  and  any other related
instruments received by the Company. The Company  shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make  any  payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle  any such demand.

 

 

SECTION  3.3 _No Further Ownership  Rights in Shares of Company Capital
Stock; Closing of Company Transfer  Books_. At  and after the Effective
Time, each holder of Company Capital Stock shall cease  to have any rights as
a stockholder of the Company, except for, in the case  of a  holder of
Company Capital Stock (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant  to 
_Section 2.6(a)_ or Dissenting Shares), the right to surrender his or her 
Company Certificate in exchange for payment of the Per Share Merger 
Consideration or, in the case of a holder of Dissenting Shares, to perfect 
his  or her right to receive payment for his or her shares of Company Capital
Stock  pursuant to the DGCL, and no transfer of shares of Company Capital
Stock shall  be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation. At  the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed,  and  no transfer of shares of Company Capital Stock shall
thereafter be  made. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are 
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged  as  provided for in this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  3.4 _Withholding  Rights_. Parent  and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from  the  consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Equityholder  such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making  of such payment
under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local  or  foreign Tax
Law (including under Section 1445 of the Code, if applicable);  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall  notify any
Equityholder from whom funds are properly withheld of the amount  of  such
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by  Parent or the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with the foregoing, such  withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having  been
paid to the Equityholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding 
was made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

**ARTICLE  IV.**

 

 

**REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 

 

Contemporaneously  with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, Parent and  Merger Sub, the Company shall deliver to Parent and
Merger Sub a disclosure  schedule with numbered sections corresponding to the
relevant sections in this  Agreement (the " _Company  Disclosure Schedule_
"). Any  exception or qualification set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule with  respect to a particular representation, warranty or covenant
contained herein  shall be deemed to be an exception or qualification with
respect to all other  applicable representations, warranties and covenants
contained in this Agreement  if the applicability of such exception or
qualification to any other applicable  representation, warranty or covenant
would be reasonably apparent to a Person  reviewing the Company Disclosure
Schedule, regardless of whether an explicit  reference to such other
representation, warranty or covenant is  made. Nothing in the Company
Disclosure Schedule is intended to  broaden the scope of any representation,
warranty or covenant of the Company  contained in this Agreement. Subject 
to the  exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule,  the  Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub as  follows:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  4.1 _Authority_. The  Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this  Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder
and to consummate the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
execution and  delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by
the Company of  its  obligations hereunder, and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, have been duly
authorized by the Board of  Directors of the Company, and no other corporate
action on the part of the  Company is necessary to authorize the execution
and delivery of this Agreement  by the Company, the performance by the
Company of its obligations hereunder  or  the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, other than the Required
Company Stockholder Vote. This  Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming  due  authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties to this Agreement,  this Agreement constitutes
a legally valid and binding obligation of the  Company, enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms, except  as  such enforceability
may be subject to (i) the effect of any applicable Law  of  general
application relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,  moratorium
or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights and relief of debtors  generally
and (ii) the effect of rules of law and general principles of equity, 
including rules of Law and general principles of equity governing specific 
performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies (regardless of 
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at 
Law). The affirmative vote or consent of (i) the holders of a  majority of
the shares of the outstanding Company Capital Stock voting or  consenting, as
the case may be, on an as-if-converted to Company Common Stock  basis, and
(ii) the holders of a majority of the shares of the outstanding  Company
Preferred Stock are the only votes of the holders of any Company Capital 
Stock necessary under the DGCL and the Company Certificate of Incorporation 
to  adopt this Agreement (the " _Required Company Stockholder  Vote_ ").

 

 

SECTION  4.2 _Organization_ _;  Subsidiaries_.

 

 

(a) The  Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing  under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and has all requisite
corporate power  and authority to own, operate or lease the properties and
assets now owned,  operated or leased by it, and to carry on the Business.
The Company  is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, and
is in good  standing, under the Laws of each jurisdiction in which the
character of its  properties owned, operated or leased, or the nature of its
activities, makes  such qualification necessary, except in those
jurisdictions where the failure  to  be so qualified or in good standing,
when taken together with all other failures  by the Acquired Companies to be
so qualified or in good standing, would not  reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. True and  complete copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation (the " _Company Certificate  of Incorporation_ ") and Bylaws
(the " _Company Bylaws_ ") of the Company,  each as amended and in effect as
of the date of this Agreement, have been  provided to Parent or its advisors.
The Company is not in violation  of any of the provisions of the Company
Certificate of Incorporation or the  Company Bylaws.

 

 

(b) _Section  4.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true,
correct and  complete list of the Company's Subsidiaries. Each of the
Subsidiaries  of the Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good  standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation, and has all  requisite corporate power and authority to own,
operate or lease the properties  and assets now owned, operated or leased by
it, and to carry on the  Business. Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly
qualified to do  business as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing,
under the Laws  of  each jurisdiction in which the character of its
properties owned, operated  or  leased, or the nature of its activities,
makes such qualification necessary,  except in those jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or in good  standing, when taken together with all
other failures by the Acquired Companies  to be so qualified or in good
standing, would not reasonably be expected to  have  a Material Adverse
Effect. The Company owns directly or indirectly  all of the issued and

Parent and Merger Sub,  the  performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of
its respective obligations  hereunder, and the consummation by each of Parent
and Merger Sub of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, have been
duly authorized by the  Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub
and no other corporate  or  other action on the part of either Parent or
Merger Sub is necessary to  authorize the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by each of Parent and  Merger Sub, the performance by each of
Parent and Merger Sub of its respective  obligations hereunder or the
consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub  of  the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement has  been duly executed and

Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger  Sub 
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be subject 
to  (i) the effect of any applicable Law of general application relating to 
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or similar Laws affecting 
creditors' rights and relief of debtors generally and (ii) the effect of
rules  of Law and general principles of equity, including rules of Law and
general  principles of equity governing specific performance, injunctive
relief and  other  equitable remedies (regardless of whether such

33  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  5.2 _Organization_. Each  of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation

the jurisdiction of its organization, and  has  all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, operate or lease the  properties and assets now
owned, operated or leased by it, and to carry on  its  business as currently
conducted. Parent is duly qualified to do  business as a foreign corporation,
and is in good standing, under the Laws  of  each jurisdiction in which the
character of its properties owned, operated  or  leased, or the nature of
its activities, makes such qualification necessary,  except in those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good  standing, when
taken together with all other failures by Parent to be so  qualified or in
good standing, would not have a material adverse effect on  the  ability of
Parent to perform its obligations under this Agreement or consummate  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  5.3   _Conflicts_. The  execution and delivery of this Agreement
by each of Parent and Merger Sub,  the  performance by each of Parent and
Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder,  and  the consummation by each of
Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,
does not and will not (i) conflict with or  result in a violation of the
organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub;  (ii) assuming all
consents, approvals, authorizations, filings and notifications  and other
actions set forth in _Section 5.4_ of the Company Disclosure  Schedule have
been obtained or made, conflict with or result in a violation  of  any
Governmental Order or Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or their 
respective assets or properties; or (iii) assuming all consents, waivers, 
approvals and authorities that are required pursuant to the terms of the 
contracts set forth in _Section 5.4_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule are 
obtained, result in a breach of, or constitute a default (or event which
with  the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become a default)
under,  or give rise to any rights of termination, amendment, modification,
acceleration  or cancellation of or loss of any benefit under any Contract to
which Parent  or  Merger Sub is a party, or by which any of the assets or
properties of Parent  or  Merger Sub is bound or affected, except, in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii)  of this _Section 5.3_ , as would not
reasonably be expected to have a  material adverse effect on the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to perform its  respective obligations under this
Agreement or consummate the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  5.4 _Consents, Approvals,  Etc_. No  consent, waiver, approval,
authorization, order or permit of, or declaration,  filing or registration
with, or notification to, any Governmental Authority  or  third party is
required to be made or obtained by Parent or Merger Sub in  connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent  and Merger
Sub, the performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of its  respective

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except (i) the  filing of
the Certificate of Merger pursuant to the DGCL; (ii) applicable 
requirements, if any, under the DGCL, federal or state securities or "blue
sky" Laws; (iii) such filings as may be required under the HSR Act; and (iv)
where  the failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization or action,
or to  make such filing or notification would not, when taken together with
all other  such failures by Parent and Merger Sub, reasonably be expected to
have a  material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
perform its  respective obligations under this Agreement or consummate the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  5.5 _Due Diligence  Investigation_. Parent  has had an opportunity
to discuss the business, management, operations and  finances of the Acquired
Companies with their respective officers, directors,  employees, agents,
representatives and affiliates, and has had an opportunity  to  inspect the
facilities of the Acquired Companies. Parent has conducted its  own 
independent investigation of the Acquired Companies. In making its  decision
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent has relied solely upon  the 
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article IV_ and 
of the Equityholders set forth in _Article VI_ (and acknowledges that such 
representations and warranties are the only representations and warranties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  by any Acquired Company and any Equityholder, as the case may be) and
has not  relied upon any other information provided by, for or on behalf of
the Acquired  Companies or Equityholders, or their respective agents or
representatives,  to  Parent in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement. Parent has entered into the transactions
contemplated by  this Agreement with the understanding, acknowledgement and
agreement that no  representations or warranties, express or implied, are
made with respect to  any  projection or forecast regarding future results
or activities or the probable  success or profitability of any Acquired
Company. Parent acknowledges  that no current or former stockholder,
director, officer, employee, affiliate  or  advisor of any Acquired Company
has made or is making any representations,  warranties or commitments
whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this  Agreement, express or
implied, except as set forth in _Article  VI_.

 

 

SECTION  5.6 _Brokers_. Except  for RBC Financial Group (the fees and
expenses of which shall be paid in full  by  Parent), no broker, finder or
investment banker is entitled to any brokerage,  finder's or other fee or
commission in connection with the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement based upon any arrangements made by or on behalf  of Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates.

 

 

SECTION  5.7 _No Prior  Activities_. Merger  Sub has not incurred nor will
it incur any liabilities or obligations, except  those incurred in connection
with its organization and with the negotiation  of  this Agreement and the
performance of its obligations hereunder and the  consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including  the  Merger. Except
as contemplated by this Agreement, Merger Sub had not  engaged in any
business activities of any type or kind whatsoever, or entered  into any
agreements or arrangements with any Person, or become subject to or  bound by
any obligation or undertaking. As of the date of this  Agreement, all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is  owned beneficially and
of record by Parent, free and clear of all Encumbrances  (other than those
created by this Agreement and the transactions contemplated  by  this
Agreement).

 

 

SECTION  5.8 _Financing_. Parent  has provided the Company with a true and
correct copy of a fully executed debt  commitment letter and term sheet,
including all exhibits, schedules or  amendments thereto (but excluding the
fee letter) as of the date hereof (as  amended, waived or otherwise modified,
the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ")  dated November 15, 2007, from its lender
to use its commercially reasonable  efforts to arrange a credit facility in
an amount up to four hundred fifty  million dollars ($450,000,000), pursuant
to which such lender has committed,  subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein, to lend up to ninety  million dollars ($90,000,000) of the
credit facility. To the  knowledge of Parent, as of the date hereof, the Debt
Commitment Letter is in  full force and effect and has not been terminated.
The financing  contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter is not subject to
any condition  precedent or other restriction limiting the availability of
such financing  other  than as described in the Debt Commitment Letter. The
Debt Commitment  Letter permits Parent and Merger Sub to use the proceeds of
the credit facility  arranged thereunder to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and no approval from the
lender arranging the  credit facility or any other lender thereunder is
required to use the proceeds  of the credit facility for such purpose. As of
the date hereof,  Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions
set forth in the  Debt  Commitment Letter will not be satisfied on or prior
to the Closing  Date.

will be duly executed and delivered by such Equityholder and constitute, or 
when  executed and delivered will constitute, the valid and binding
agreements of  such  Equityholder, enforceable in accordance with their
terms, except as such  enforceability may be subject to (i) the effect of any
applicable Law of general  application relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium  or  similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights and relief of debtors generally and  (ii) the effect of
rules of law and general principles of equity, including  rules of Law and

(f) by  the Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant

any Equityholder's representations and  warranties or breach by the Company
or such Equityholder is curable by the  Company or such Equityholder prior to
the Expiration Date through the exercise  of reasonable efforts, then Parent
may not terminate this Agreement under this  _Section 9.1(g)_ prior to thirty

twelve month anniversary of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Closing Date (the " _Expiration Date_ "), except that the Fundamental 
Representations shall survive without limitation; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that if, at any time prior to the applicable Expiration Date,  (a) Parent
(acting in good faith) delivers to the Equityholders' Representative  a
written notice alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in or a breach of 
any  of the representations and warranties made by the Company in _Article
IV_   or by an Equityholder in _Article VI_ setting forth in reasonable
detail  the basis for Parent's belief that such an inaccuracy or breach may

(acting in good  faith) delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written

representations and  warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in _Article V_
setting forth in  reasonable detail the basis for the belief of the
Equityholders' Representative  that such an inaccuracy or breach may exist
and asserting a claim for recovery  under _Section 10.2_ based on such
alleged inaccuracy or breach then, in  the case of clause (a) or clause (b),

SECTION  10.2 _Right to  Indemnification_.

 

 

(a) Subject  to the limitations set forth in this _Article X_ , from and
after the  Effective Time, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and

and  affiliates (the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be entitled to
be  indemnified, solely from the Escrow Fund (other than for claims relating
to  the  breach of a Fundamental Representation or claims in connection with
_Section  2.8(d)(i)_ hereof, which shall not be limited to the Escrow Fund,
which  obligations shall be several and not joint and with respect to which
no  Equityholder shall be liable to any Parent Indemnified Parties for
Damages  in  excess of the Merger Consideration actually received by such
Person), against  any Damages actually incurred as a proximate result of: (i)
any breach or  inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in
_Article IV_ and  (ii) any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement
of the Company set  forth in this Agreement.

jointly,  indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties
from and  in  respect of, and to promptly pay to a Parent Indemnified Party
or reimburse  a  Parent Indemnified Party for, any and all Damages actually
incurred as a  proximate result of any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty  of such Equityholder set forth in _Article VI_.

 

 

(c) Subject  to the limitations set forth in this _Article X_ , from and
after the  Effective Time, the Equityholders and their respective officers,
directors,  employees, agents, representatives and affiliates (the "
_Equityholder  Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be entitled to be indemnified by
Parent and the  Surviving Corporation against any Damages actually incurred
by any of the  Equityholder Indemnified Parties as a proximate result of: (i)
any breach of  any  representation or warranty set forth in _Article V_ or
(ii) any breach of  any covenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub set
forth in this  Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  10.3 _Limitations on  Liability_.

 

 

(a) From  and after the Effective Time, the right of the Parent Indemnified
Parties to  be  indemnified from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this _Article
X_ shall be the  sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any breach of any
representation  or  warranty of the Company contained in, or any other
breach by the Company of,  this Agreement, other than for claims relating to
the breach of a Fundamental  Representation or claims in connection with
_Section 2.8(d)(i)_   hereof. The right of the Parent Indemnified Parties to
be indemnified  solely and exclusively from the Escrow Fund shall not apply
to claims relating  to the breach of a Fundamental Representation or to
claims in connection with  _Section 2.8(d)(i)_ hereof; _provided_ , that any
indemnification  obligation of the Equityholders relating to the breach of a

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fundamental  Representation or to claims in connection with _Section
2.8(d)(i)_ hereof  shall be several and not joint; and _provided_ , _further_
, that in no  event shall any Equityholder be liable to any Parent
Indemnified Parties for  Damages relating to the breach of Fundamental
Representations or claims in  connection with _Section 2.8(d)(i)_ hereof in
excess of the Merger  Consideration actually received by such Person. Except
as provided  with respect to the Equityholders in the immediately preceding
sentence, no  current or former stockholder, director, officer, employee,
affiliate or advisor  of the Company shall have any Liability of any nature
to any Parent Indemnified  Party with respect to any breach of any
representation or warranty contained  in,  or any other breach of, this
Agreement. From and after the Effective  Time, the right of the Equityholder
Indemnified Parties to be indemnified  pursuant to this _Article X_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy with  respect to any breach of any
representation or warranty of Parent or Merger  Sub  contained in, or any
other breach by Parent or Merger Sub of, this  Agreement. No current or
former stockholder, director, officer,  employee, affiliate or advisor of
Parent or Merger Sub shall have any Liability  of any nature to any
Equityholder Indemnified Party with respect to any breach  of any
representation or warranty contained in, or any other breach of, this 
Agreement.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
except for Damages  resulting from a breach of _Sections_ _4.1_ , _4.2_ or
_4.3_ ,  no party hereto (nor, in each case, such party's officers,
directors, employees,  agents, representatives, and affiliates) shall be
liable to another party in  respect of any indemnification hereunder pursuant
to  _Section_ _10.2(a)(i)_ or _10.2(c)(i)_ except to the extent that  the
aggregate amount (without duplication) of Damages of the party seeking 
indemnification exceeds $750,000.00 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event 
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall, subject to the other limitations
contained  herein, be entitled to be indemnified only against the portion of
Damages in  excess of the Deductible. Any amounts payable by the
Equityholders to  a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section_
_10.3_ shall be  paid solely and exclusively from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms  of  the Escrow Agreement, and no holder of
Company Capital Stock, Company Option  or  any other Person shall be liable
for any deficiency with respect to indemnity  pursuant to this _Section_
_10._ _3_ except with respect to the  breach of a Fundamental Representation
or claims in connection with _Section  2.8(d)(i)_ hereof.

 

 

(c) Without  limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
_Article X_ ,  for purposes of computing the amount of any Damages incurred
by Parent under  this _Article X_ , there shall be deducted: (i) an amount
equal to the  amount of any Tax benefit actually realized by Parent or any of
its Affiliates  in connection with such Damages or any of the circumstances
giving rise thereto;  and (ii) an amount equal to the amount of any insurance
proceeds,  indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements
actually  received (net of costs of enforcement, deductibles and retro-
premium  adjustments) by Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with
such Damages  or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto (it being
understood that Parent  and any of its Affiliates shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain  such proceeds, payments or reimbursements). The
calculation of  Damages shall not include losses arising because of a change
after Closing  in  Law or accounting principle. To the extent that a claim
for  indemnification by Parent or Merger Sub hereunder relates to a
Liability  incurred by the Company and there is an accrual on the Closing
Balance Sheet  (as  finally determined in accordance with _Section 2.8_ ) in
respect of such  Liability, then the determination of Damages in respect of
such claim shall  be  net of such accrual.

 

 

(d) Without  limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
_Article X_ ,  Parent shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
_Article X_ to  the extent that such right of indemnification is addressed in
the adjustments  to  the Per Share Merger Consideration made following the
Closing pursuant to  _Section 2.8_.

 

 

(e) Nothing  in this _Section 10.3_ shall limit any remedy Parent or any of
the  Equityholders may have against any Person for actual fraud involving a
knowing  and intentional misrepresentation of a fact material to the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement made with the intent of inducing
any other party 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hereto  to enter into this Agreement and upon which such other party has
relied (as  opposed to any fraud claim based on constructive knowledge,
negligent  misrepresentation or a similar theory) under applicable tort laws.

 

 

SECTION  10.4 _Defense of  Third-Party Claims_.

 

 

(a) Upon  receipt by any Person seeking to be indemnified pursuant to
_Section 10.2_   (the " _Indemnitee_ ") of notice of any actual or possible
claim, demand,  suit, action, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or
proceeding that has been  or  may be brought or asserted by a third party
against such Indemnitee and that  may  be subject to indemnification
hereunder (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the  Indemnitee shall promptly give
notice of such Third-Party Claim to the Person  from whom indemnification is
sought under _Section 10.2_ (the " _Indemnitor_ ") indicating the nature of
such Third-Party Claim and the  stated basis therefor and the amount of
Damages claimed pursuant to such  Third-Party Claim, to the extent known.

 

 

(b) The  Indemnitor shall have 30 days after receipt of the Indemnitee's
notice of a  given Third-Party Claim to elect, at its option, to assume the
defense of any  such Third-Party Claim, in which case: (i) the attorneys'
fees, other  professionals' and experts' fees and court or arbitration costs
incurred by the  Indemnitor in connection with defending such Third-Party
Claim shall be payable  by such Indemnitor; (ii) the Indemnitee shall be
entitled to monitor such  defense at its sole expense; (iii) the Indemnitee
shall make available to the  Indemnitor all books, records and other
documents and materials that are under  the direct or indirect control of the
Indemnitee or any of its Subsidiaries  or  other Affiliates and that the
Indemnitor reasonably considers necessary or  desirable for the defense of
such Third-Party Claim; (iv) the Indemnitee shall  execute such documents and
take such other actions as the Indemnitor may  reasonably request for the
purpose of facilitating the defense of, or any  settlement, compromise or
adjustment relating to, such Third-Party Claim; (v)  the Indemnitee shall
otherwise fully cooperate as reasonably requested by the  Indemnitor in the
defense of such Third-Party Claim; (vi) the Indemnitee shall  not admit any
liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim; and (vii) the  Indemnitor
shall not enter into any agreement providing for the settlement  or 
compromise of such Third-Party Claim or the consent to the entry of a
judgment  with respect to such Third-Party Claim without the prior written
consent of  Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or  delayed). The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ
separate  counsel in such Third-Party Claim and participate in such defense
thereof,  but  the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense
of the Indemnitee,  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitee shall be
entitled, at the  Indemnitor's cost, risk and expense, to retain one firm of
separate counsel of  its own choosing (along with any required local counsel)
if (i) the Indemnitor  and the Indemnitee so mutually agree; (ii) the
Indemnitor fails within a  reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee;  (iii) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be legal  defenses available to it that are
different from or in addition to those  available to the Indemnitor; or (iv)
the named parties in any such proceeding  (including any impleaded parties)
include both the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee  and representation of both
sets of parties by the same counsel would be  inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between  them. If the Indemnitor elects not to
defend such Third-Party Claim,  then (i) the Indemnitee shall diligently
defend such Third-Party Claim and  (ii)  the Indemnitor shall be liable for
any agreement providing for the settlement  or  compromise of such Third-
Party Claim or the consent to the entry of a judgment  with respect to such
Third-Party Claim.

SECTION  11.1 _Equityholders ' Representative_.

 

 

(a) _Appointment_. By  virtue of the adoption of this Agreement by the
Company's stockholders, and  without further action of any Company
stockholder, each Equityholder shall  be  deemed to have irrevocably
constituted and appointed Weston Presidio Capital  IV,  L.P. (and by
execution of this Agreement it hereby accepts such appointment)  as  agent
and attorney-in-fact (" _Equityholders ' Representative_") for and on  behalf
of the Equityholders (in their capacity as such), with full power of 
substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of each Equityholder with 
respect to _Section 2.8_ , _Article X_ and the Escrow Agreement and the 
taking by the Equityholders' Representative of any and all actions and the 
making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the
Equityholders' Representative under _Section 2.8_ , _Article X_ or the
Escrow  Agreement and to accept on behalf of each Equityholder service of
process and  any notices required to be served on the Equityholders. The
power of  attorney granted in this _Section 11.1_ is coupled with an interest
and is  irrevocable, may be delegated by the Equityholders' Representative
and shall  survive the death or incapacity of each Equityholder. Such agency
may  be changed by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund
from  time  to time (including in the event of the death, disability or
other incapacity  of  an Equityholders' Representative that is an
individual), and any such successor  shall succeed the Equityholders'
Representative as Equityholders' Representative  hereunder. For the avoidance
of doubt, any compromise or settlement  of any matter by the Equityholders'
Representative hereunder shall be binding  on, and fully enforceable against,
all Equityholders. No bond shall  be required of the Equityholders'

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Representative,  and the Equityholders' Representative shall receive no
compensation for its  services. The Equityholders' Representative shall be
entitled to use  in its sole discretion any and all amounts constituting the
Equityholders' Representative Expense Fund to pay all costs and expenses
(including all fees  and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and
accountants) incurred  by  the Equityholders' Representative in connection
with the performance of its  rights or obligations under this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement and the  taking of any and all actions in connection
therewith. The  Equityholders' Representative shall not be required to take
any action or to  incur any cost or expense (including all fees and
disbursements of counsel,  financial advisors and accountants) if the
Equityholders' Representative Expense  Fund does not contain funds sufficient
to reimburse the Equityholders' Representative with respect to any such cost
or expense.

 

 

(b) _Limitation  on Liability_. The Equityholders' Representative shall not
be  liable to any Person for any act of the Equityholders' Representative
taken in  good faith and in the exercise of its reasonable judgment and
arising out of  or  in connection with the acceptance or administration of
its duties under this  Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (it being
understood that any act done or  omitted pursuant to the advice of legal
counsel shall be conclusive evidence  of  such good faith and reasonable
judgment), except to the extent any liability,  loss, damage, penalty, fine,
cost or expense is actually incurred by such Person  as a proximate result of
the gross negligence or bad faith of the Equityholders' Representative. The
Equityholders' Representative shall not be liable  for, and may seek
indemnification from the Equityholders for, any liability,  loss, damage,
penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred by the Equityholders' Representative
while acting in good faith and in the exercise of its reasonable  judgment
and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or  administration of
its duties under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,  except to the
extent that any such liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine,  cost  or
expense is the proximate result of the gross negligence or bad faith of 
the  Equityholders' Representative.

 

 

(c) _Access_. From  and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation  to  provide the Equityholders' Representative with
reasonable access to information  about the Surviving Corporation solely for
purposes of performing its duties  and  exercising its rights under this
Agreement, provided, that the Equityholders' Representative shall treat
confidentially any nonpublic information about the  Surviving Corporation
(except in connection with the performance by the  Equityholders'
Representative of its duties or the exercise of its rights under  this
Agreement).

 

 

(d) _Actions  of the Equityholders ' Representative_. From and after the 
Effective Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Equityholders' Representative shall constitute a decision of all
Equityholders and shall be  final, binding and conclusive upon each
Equityholder, and the Escrow Agent  and  Parent may rely upon any decision,
act, consent or instruction of the  Equityholders' Representative as being
the decision, act, consent or instruction  of each Equityholder. Parent is
hereby relieved from any liability to  any Person for any acts done by Parent
in accordance with any such decision,  act, consent or instruction of the
Equityholders' Representative.

 

 

SECTION  11.2 _Expenses_. Except  as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses  (including all fees and disbursements of
counsel, financial advisors and  accountants) incurred in connection with the
negotiation and preparation of  this  Agreement, the performance of the
terms of this Agreement and the consummation  of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, shall be paid by the  respective party
incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the Closing  shall have
occurred.

forth herein, including _Article X_ , in the event  that any action, suit or
other proceeding is instituted concerning or arising  out of this Agreement,

to this Agreement shall make any public announcements  in  respect of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  or  otherwise

contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior written consent  of the
other parties to this Agreement. If a public statement is  required to be
made pursuant to applicable Law or applicable stock exchange  rules and
regulations, the parties shall consult with each other, to the extent

SECTION  11.6 _Interpretation_. The  Article and Section headings in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference  only and shall not be deemed to
alter or affect the meaning or interpretation  of  any provision of this
Agreement. References to Articles, Sections,  Schedules or Exhibits in this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated, are  references to Articles, Sections,
Schedules and Exhibits of or to this  Agreement. The parties to this
Agreement have participated jointly in  the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. In the event an  ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises with respect to any  term or provision of this Agreement, this
Agreement shall be construed as if  drafted jointly by the parties to this
Agreement, and no presumption or burden  of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party to this Agreement by  virtue of the authorship of any
of the terms or provisions of this  Agreement. Any reference to any federal,
state, county, local or  foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer
to all rules and  regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires  otherwise. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, (i) the
word "including" shall be deemed to be immediately followed by the words
"without  limitation;" (ii) words (including defined terms) in the singular
shall be  deemed to include the plural and vice versa; (iii) words of one
gender shall  be  deemed to include the other gender as the context
requires; (iv) the terms  "hereof," "herein," "hereto," "herewith" and any
other words of similar import  shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed

this Agreement, unless otherwise specified  and (v) unless otherwise defined
in this Agreement, accounting terms shall  have  the respective meanings
assigned to them in accordance with GAAP consistently  applied with the
Company Financial Statements.

 

 

SECTION  11.7 _Severability_. In  the event that any one or more of the
terms or provisions contained in this  Agreement or in any other certificate,
instrument or other document referred  to  in this Agreement, shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or  unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unenforceability  shall not affect any other term or provision of this
Agreement or any other  such  certificate, instrument or other document
referred to in this Agreement, and  the  parties to this Agreement shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to  substitute one or more valid, legal
and enforceable terms or provisions into  this Agreement which, insofar as
practicable, implement the purposes and intent  of this Agreement. Any term
or provision of this Agreement held  invalid or unenforceable only in part,
degree or within certain jurisdictions  shall remain in full force and effect
to the extent not held invalid or  unenforceable to the extent consistent
with the intent of the parties as  reflected by this Agreement. To the extent
permitted by applicable  Law, each party waives any term or provision of Law
which renders any term  or  provision of this Agreement to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any  respect.

 

 

SECTION  11.8 _Entire  Agreement_. This  Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the other Schedules and  the Exhibits to this Agreement)
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute  the  entire agreement of the
parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject  matter of this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, and supersede all  prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties  to 
this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the 
Confidentiality Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this 
Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  11.9 _Assignment_. Neither  this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall  be assigned by any of the parties
to this Agreement (whether by operation of  law  or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other parties to this  Agreement, and any
purported assignment or other transfer without such consent  shall be void
and unenforceable. Subject to the preceding sentence,  this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable  by the parties
to this Agreement and their respective successors and  assigns.

 

 

SECTION  11.10 _No Third-Party  Beneficiaries_. Except  for _Article II_ ,
_Section 7.7_ and _Article X_ , this Agreement  is for the sole benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this  Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other  Person any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever  under or by
reason of this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  11.11 _Waivers and  Amendments_. This  Agreement may be amended or
modified only by a written instrument executed  by  all of the parties to
this Agreement. Any failure of the parties to  this Agreement to comply with
any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition  in this Agreement may be
waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof  only by a written
instrument signed by the party granting such  waiver. No delay on the part of
any party to this Agreement in  exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver  thereof, nor shall any waiver on the
part of any party to this Agreement of  any  right, power or privilege
hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right,  power or privilege
hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any  right, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise  thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege  hereunder. Unless otherwise
provided, the rights and remedies  provided for in this Agreement are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any  rights or remedies which the parties
to this Agreement may otherwise have at  law  or in equity. Whenever this
Agreement requires or permits consent by  or on behalf of a party, such
consent shall be given in writing in a manner  consistent with the
requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in  this  _Section
11.11_.

 

 

SECTION  11.12 _Governing Law; Consent to  Jurisdiction_. This  Agreement
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws  of  the
State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed 
entirely within such State. Each of the parties to this Agreement  hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its assets and 
properties, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State court, or 
Federal court of the United States of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

America,  sitting within the State of Delaware, and any appellate court from
any thereof,  in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the  agreements delivered in connection with this Agreement, or
the transactions  contemplated hereby or thereby, or for recognition or
enforcement of any  judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties to
this Agreement hereby  irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to
commence any such action  or  proceeding except in such courts; (ii) agrees
that any claim in respect of  any  such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such Delaware State  court or, to the extent permitted by
Law, in such Federal court; (iii) waives,  to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which  it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such action or  proceeding in any such
Delaware State or Federal court; and (iv) waives, to  the  fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the  maintenance of
such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal  court. Each
of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that a  final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may  be  enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner  provided by
Law. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby  irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices  in  _Section 11.4_.
Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right  of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted  by  applicable
Law.

 

 

SECTION  11.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH  PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH  MAY  ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT  ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE, IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY  RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY  OR 
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE 
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS 
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT  CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF  ANY  OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY  WOULD 
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS,
(II)  IT  UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS,
(III) IT MAKES  SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS  AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN  THIS  _SECTION 11.13_.

 

 

SECTION  11.14 _Exclusivity of Representations and  Warranties_. It  is the
explicit intent and understanding of each of the parties to this  Agreement
that no party to this Agreement, nor any of their respective  Affiliates,
representatives or agents, is making any representation or warranty 
whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied, other than those set forth 
in  this Agreement (as qualified by the Company Disclosure Schedule), and
none  of  the parties to this Agreement is relying on any statement,
representation or  warranty, oral or written, express or implied, made by
another party to this  Agreement or such other party's Affiliates,
representatives or agents, except  for the representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  11.15 _Equitable Remedies_. Each  of the parties to this Agreement
acknowledges and agrees that the other parties  to this Agreement would be
irreparably damaged in the event that any of the  terms or provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with  their  specific terms or
otherwise are breached. Therefore, notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties to  this Agreement hereby
agrees that the other parties to this Agreement shall  be  entitled to seek
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any of  the  terms or
provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the  performance by
such first party under this Agreement, and each party to this  Agreement
hereby agrees to waive the defense in any such suit that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  parties to this Agreement have an adequate remedy at law and to
interpose no  opposition, legal or otherwise, as to the propriety of
injunction or specific  performance  as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive
any requirement to post any bond in  connection with obtaining such relief.
The equitable remedies  described in this _Section 11.15_ shall be in
addition to, and not in lieu  of, any other remedies at law or in equity that
the parties to this Agreement  may elect to pursue.

 

 

SECTION  11.16 _Counterparts_. This  Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which when  executed shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which taken together  shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

 

 

SECTION  11.17 _Time is of the  Essence_. Time  is of the essence with
respect to the performance of this Agreement
