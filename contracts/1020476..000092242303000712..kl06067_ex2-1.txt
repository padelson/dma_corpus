                      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

     This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made and
entered on June 23, 2003, by and among Kroll Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Acquiror"), Golden Mountain Acquisition Corporation, a Colorado corporation
("Merger Sub"), and Factual Data Corp., a Colorado corporation ("Target").

                                    RECITALS
      A. The Boards of Directors of Target, Acquiror and Merger Sub believe it
is in the best interests of their respective companies and the shareholders of
their respective companies that Target and Merger Sub combine into a single
company through the statutory merger of Merger Sub with and into Target (the
"Merger") and, in furtherance thereof, have declared the advisability of and
approved the Merger and the Agreement.

      B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, each outstanding share of
common stock, no par value, of Target ("Target Common Stock"), shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Consideration (as hereinafter
defined) on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

      C. Target, Acquiror and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations
and warranties and other agreements in connection with the Merger.

      D. Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement and as an inducement to
Acquiror to enter into this Agreement, certain affiliates of Target are entering
into an agreement to vote the shares of Target Common Stock owned by such
affiliates to approve the Merger and against competing proposals in accordance
with the terms thereof.

      E. Certain defined terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed thereto in Schedule A hereto.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and representations set
forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree
as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

1.1   THE MERGER

      At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Articles of Merger attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
"Articles of Merger") and the applicable provisions of the Colorado Business
Corporation Act ("Colorado Law"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
Target, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Target
shall continue as the surviving corporation under the name "Kroll Factual Data,
Inc.". Target as the surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation".

herein contemplated shall have been abandoned pursuant to Section 7.1, the

with the Secretary of State of the State of Colorado, in accordance with the

this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the applicable provisions of Colorado
Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at

liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.4   ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION; BYLAWS

      (a) At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Target shall

as provided by Colorado Law, except that as of the Effective Time, Article I of
the Articles of Incorporation shall be amended to read: "The name of the
corporation shall be Kroll Factual Data, Inc." and such Articles of
Incorporation shall contain the indemnification provision set forth in Section
5.9(a).

      (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and which shall contain the indemnification provisions set forth

1.6   EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK

      By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror,
Merger Sub, Target or the holders of any of Target's securities:

            (a) Cancellation of Target Common Stock Owned by Acquiror or Target.
At the Effective Time, all shares of Target Common Stock that are owned by
Target as treasury stock, and each share of Target Common Stock owned by
Acquiror or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror or of
Target immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration therefor.

            (b) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. At the Effective Time,
each share of common stock, no par value, of Merger Sub will be converted
automatically into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

            (c) Conversion of Target Common Stock. (i) Subject to Sections
1.6(c)(ii)(A) and (B) below and subject to Section 7.1(j) hereof, at the
Effective Time, each share of Target Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Target Common
Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or any shares of Target Common
Stock to which dissenters' rights have been exercised pursuant to Section
1.6(g)) will be converted automatically into the right to receive the Per Share
Consideration (as defined below).

                  (ii) Per Share Consideration. The term "Per Share
Consideration" means for each share of Target Common Stock, the right to receive
(x) $14.00 (the "Cash Consideration Per Share") and (y) the fraction of one
fully-paid and non-assessable share of common stock, $.01 par value, of Acquiror
(the "Acquiror Common Stock") equal to a fraction (rounded to four decimal
places, with the number five and below being rounded down), the numerator of
which is $3.50 and the denominator of which is the Average Stock Price (subject
to Sections 1.6(c)(ii)(A) and (B) and 7.1(j), such fraction being the "Exchange
Ratio"); provided, however,

                        (A) if the Average Stock Price is equal to or less
than $23.85 the Exchange Ratio shall, for the purposes of this Agreement be
deemed to equal 0.1467, except as may be otherwise provided in Section 7.1(j);
and
                        (B) if the Average Stock Price is equal to or
greater than $29.15, the Exchange Ratio shall, for the purposes of this
Agreement, be deemed to equal 0.1201.

            (d) Target Stock Option Plans. At the Effective Time, Target's 1997
Stock Incentive Plan, 1999 Employee Formula Award Stock Option Plan, and the
Stock Option Agreements dated May 4, 2001 (collectively, the "Target Stock
Option Plans") and all options to purchase Target Common Stock then outstanding
under the Target Stock Option Plans shall be automatically assumed by Acquiror
in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 5.12.


                                       3
<PAGE>

            (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratios. The Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into
Acquiror Common Stock or Target Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization
or other like change with respect to Acquiror Common Stock or Target Common
Stock having a record date after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time.
             (f) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Acquiror Common
Stock will be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Target Common
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Acquiror
Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock
to be received by such holder) shall receive from Acquiror an amount of cash
(rounded down to the nearest whole cent, without interest) equal to the product
of (x) such fraction, multiplied by (y) the Average Stock Price (subject to
Sections 1.6(c)(ii)(A) and (B) and 7.1(j)).

             (g) Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, any Target Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time held by a holder who has demanded and perfected the right,
if any, to receive fair value for such Target Common Stock ("Dissenting Shares")
in accordance with the provisions of Article 7-113-101 et. seq. of Colorado Law
and as of the Effective Time has not withdrawn or lost such dissenter's rights
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the consideration
pursuant to Section 1.7(a) (the "Merger Consideration"), but the shareholder
shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by Colorado Law. If a
holder of Target Common Stock who asserts dissenter's rights under Colorado Law
withdraws or loses such rights (through failure to perfect or otherwise), then,
as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever last occurs,
those shares (the "Unperfected Shares") shall be converted into and represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
1.7(a), without interest, upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates
formerly representing those Unperfected Shares. Target shall give Acquiror (i)
prompt notice of any written notice of intent to demand fair value for any
Unperfected Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands, the deposit of any
shares for which payment is demanded, and any other instruments served pursuant
to Colorado Law received by the Target relating to dissenters' rights and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the
assertion of dissenters' rights under Colorado Law. Target shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Acquiror, given in its sole discretion,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any such demands for payment of
fair value, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal
of any such demands.

1.7   SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES

            (a) Exchange Agent; Acquiror to Provide Common Stock and Cash.
Promptly after the date hereof, Acquiror shall appoint a commercial bank or
trust company, or a subsidiary thereof, as an exchange agent (the "Exchange
Agent") for the benefit of holders of Target Common Stock. At or immediately
prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall make available to or for such bank
or trust company as shall be designated by Acquiror and reasonably acceptable to
Target for exchange in accordance with this Article I, through such reasonable
procedures as Acquiror may adopt, the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 1.6(c) in exchange for shares of Target Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective



                                       4
<PAGE>

Time, plus cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of the Per Share Cash
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f)
(such cash amount and certificates being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions
in accordance with this Article I, deliver the Acquiror Common Stock and cash
contemplated to be issued and paid pursuant to this Article I out of the
Exchange Fund.

             (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, but no
later than five Business Days after the Effective Date, Acquiror shall cause to
be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the
"Certificates") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Target Common Stock, whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Consideration pursuant to Section 1.7, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the
Certificates by the Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Acquiror may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for cash and
certificates representing shares of Acquiror Common Stock. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other customary documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor, and Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent to
promptly send to the holder, one or more certificates as requested by the holder
(properly issued, executed and countersigned, as appropriate) representing the
number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock and payment of cash that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6 and any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(c),
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of shares of Target Common Stock which is not registered
in the transfer records of Target as of the Effective Time, shares of Acquiror
Common Stock, dividends, distributions and cash may be issued and paid in
accordance with this Article I to a transferee if the Certificate evidencing
such shares of Target Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
pursuant to Section 1.7(d) and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer
taxes have been paid. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that,
prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Target Common Stock will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to
evidence only the right to receive shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which
such shares of Target Common Stock shall have been so converted and an amount in
cash in accordance with Section 1.6.

            (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to Acquiror Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Acquiror Common Stock represented
thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate surrenders such
Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of such Certificate one or
more certificates representing whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, plus payments of cash in accordance with Section 1.6, plus
the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time that would have been previously payable (but for the
provisions of this Section 1.7(c)) with respect to such shares of Acquiror
Common Stock. No interest shall be paid



                                       5
<PAGE>

in connection with the issuance of Acquiror Common Stock and payments of cash
contemplated by the preceding sentence.

            (d) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares of
Acquiror Common Stock is to be issued in a name or cash is to be payable to a
person other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor
or is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance and payment thereof
that the Certificate so surrendered is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to
Acquiror or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Acquiror Common Stock in
any name and payment of the cash consideration to any person other than that of
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or established to the
satisfaction of Acquiror or the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is
not payable.

            (e) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party
hereto shall be liable to any person or entity for any amount properly paid to a

Acquiror for issuance of the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock and cash
to which such holder has become entitled, subject to the terms of this
Agreement.

third party Intellectual Property required for the carrying on of the business
of Target and its subsidiaries in the manner currently conducted (which,

without notice or lapse of time will, or could reasonably be



                                       17

any invention forming a part of any patent application (in preparation or filed)
or patent for an invention within the Target Intellectual Property owned by
Target or one of its subsidiaries, that was directly or indirectly derived from
the inventor(s) (such as a non-confidential publication or presentation by an
inventor, employee, officer, director or other representative of Target or its
subsidiaries) that could reasonably be expected to affect the ability of Target

in any jurisdiction where it is desirable and commercially reasonable for Target
or its subsidiaries to obtain patent protection.

            (l) There is no publication, such as a patent, published or
laid-open patent application, journal article, catalogue, promotion, or
specification, of another person which may prevent Target or its subsidiaries
from obtaining or sustaining valid patent rights to any patent application (in
preparation or filed) or patent for an invention within the Target Intellectual
Property owned by Target or its subsidiaries in any jurisdiction where it is
desirable and commercially reasonable for Target or its subsidiaries to obtain
patent protection.

or patent for an invention within the Target Intellectual Property owned by
Target or one of its subsidiaries, Target is not aware of any professional
opinion, such as the opinion of a patent agent or patent attorney, whether
preliminary in nature or in any other manner qualified, to the effect that the
chances of obtaining or sustaining valid patent rights to the invention are
considered to be unlikely, or less than even, or about even, or in any other
manner doubtful in any jurisdiction where it is desirable and commercially
reasonable for Target or its subsidiaries to obtain patent protection.

            (n) Except as otherwise evidenced by or described in a Target

permitted any other person or entity to reverse engineer, disassemble or
decompile the Developed Software to create such source code.

            (p) The Required Intellectual Property has not been imported or
exported in violation of any export or import restrictions in any jurisdictions
where Target or any of its subsidiaries conducts business.

            (q) Neither the past nor current use of any data bases related to

            (j) Neither Target nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to or

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

5.1   NO SOLICITATION

            (a) Upon execution of this Agreement, Target shall immediately
terminate any discussions with any Third Party concerning an Acquisition
Proposal (as defined below). Target shall not, directly or indirectly, through
any officer, director, employee, shareholder, financial advisor, attorney,
representative, subsidiary or agent of such person or entity (i) take any action
to solicit, initiate, facilitate, continue or encourage any inquiries or
proposals that constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of
substantial assets, sale of shares of capital stock or other securities
(including by way of a tender offer) or similar transaction involving Target or
any of its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to as an
"Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions (whether
such discussions or negotiations are initiated by Target, such other person or
entity or otherwise) concerning, or provide any non-public information to any
person or entity relating to, any possible Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter
into an agreement with any person or entity providing for a possible Acquisition
Proposal or make or authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in
support of any possible Acquisition Proposal by any person or entity, in each
case other than Acquiror, or (iv) agree to, enter into a letter of intent or
similar document or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Target, or its Board of
Directors, to the extent such Board of Directors determines, in good faith
(after consultation with independent legal advisors), that such Board of
Directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law require it to do so, from (A)
furnishing non-public information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, any person or entity in connection with an unsolicited, bona
fide, written Acquisition Proposal obtained not in breach of this Agreement by
such person or entity or recommending an unsolicited, bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal obtained not in breach of this Agreement by such person or
entity to the shareholders of Target, if and only to the extent that (l) the
Board of Directors of Target determines in good faith (after consultation with
independent financial and legal advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal was
obtained not in breach of this Agreement, is reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed and, after taking into account all relevant
factors, including the long-term prospects of Acquiror and Target as a combined
company, would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to
Target's shareholders from a financial point of view than the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (any such more favorable Acquisition Proposal
being referred to in this Agreement as a "Superior Proposal") and the Board of
Directors of Target determines in good faith (after consultation with
independent legal advisors) that such action is necessary for such Board of
Directors to comply



                                       36
<PAGE>

with its fiduciary duties to shareholders under applicable law and (2) prior to
furnishing such non-public information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such person or entity, (x) such Board of Directors receives
from such person or entity an executed confidentiality agreement with terms no
less favorable to Target and no more favorable to such person or entity than
those terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement dated February 5, 2003
between Acquiror and Target (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), (y) such
non-public information has been previously delivered to Acquiror, and (z) Target
immediately advises Acquiror in writing of such disclosure or discussions or
negotiations, including the person or entity to whom disclosed or with whom
discussions or negotiations will occur; or (B) complying with Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal.
Target shall ensure that the officers, directors and Affiliates of Target and
its subsidiaries and any investment banker or other financial advisor or
representative retained by Target or any of its subsidiaries are aware of the
restrictions described in this Section 5.1. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is understood that any violations of the restrictions set forth in this Section
5.1 by any officer, director, employee, financial advisor, attorney,
representative, subsidiary or agent of Target, when acting on behalf of Target
or any of its subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.1
by Target.

            (b) Target shall notify Acquiror immediately after receipt by Target
(or its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public
information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the
properties, books or records of Target or any of its subsidiaries by any person
or entity that informs such party that it is considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and in writing and shall
indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the person or entity and the terms
and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact. Target shall continue to
keep Acquiror informed, on a current basis, of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations and the terms being discussed or negotiated.

            (c) In addition to the foregoing, Target shall not accept or enter
into any agreement, letter of intent or similar document concerning an
Acquisition Proposal for a period of not less than seventy-two hours after
Acquiror's receipt of a notice of the material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal and the identity of the person or entity making such Acquisition
Proposal, and during such seventy-two hour period Target shall negotiate with
Acquiror in good faith any proposal submitted to Target by Acquiror which
addresses such Acquisition Proposal.

5.2   PROXY STATEMENT, REGISTRATION STATEMENT

            As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
Target and Acquiror shall prepare proxy materials relating to the adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby by the shareholders of Target and, as promptly as
practicable, Acquiror shall file with the SEC the Registration Statement, which
complies in form in all material respects with applicable law and SEC
requirements and each of Target and Acquiror shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective as
soon thereafter as practicable. Each of Target and Acquiror shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto and to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the shareholders of Target as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared



                                       37
<PAGE>

effective under the Securities Act. Each of Target and Acquiror shall furnish
all information concerning it (and its respective subsidiaries) to the other as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action and the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement. Each of Target and Acquiror shall promptly notify the other upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or
its staff for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the
Proxy Statement and shall promptly provide the other with copies of all
correspondence between it and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC
and its staff, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing
the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of Target and
Acquiror, as the case may be, (a) shall provide the other party with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response, (b)
shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by
such other party and (c) shall not file or mail such document or respond to the
SEC prior to receiving such other party's approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Subject to the provisions of Section 5.1, the
Proxy Statement shall include the unanimous recommendation of the Board of
Directors of Acquiror in favor of the issuance of shares of Acquiror Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger and the unanimous recommendation of the Board of
Directors of Target in favor of the Merger; provided that the recommendation of
Target's Board of Directors may not be included or may be withdrawn if
previously included if Target's Board of Directors believes in good faith (after
consultation with independent financial and legal advisors) that a Superior
Proposal has been made not in breach of this Agreement and shall determine in
good faith (after consultation with independent legal advisors) that to include
such recommendation or not withdraw such recommendation if previously included
would constitute a breach of the Target's Board of Directors' fiduciary duty
under applicable law.

5.3   SHAREHOLDERS MEETING

            Target shall promptly after the date hereof take all actions
necessary to call a meeting of its shareholders to be held as promptly as
practicable for the purpose of voting upon this Agreement and the Merger which
meeting shall be held (to the extent permitted by law) within forty-five days of
the date on which the Registration Statement is declared effective, provided
that, Target may adjourn the Shareholder Meeting until such time as its
conditions to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby set forth
in Sections 6.1(b), (c), (d) and (e) and 6.2(c) hereof have been, or within two
Business Days are reasonably expected to be, satisfied or waived by Target.
Subject to Section 5.1, Target shall, through its Board of Directors,
unanimously recommend to its shareholders approval of such matters. Target shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies
or, subject to Section 5.1, regarding such matters (whether or not the Board of
Directors of Target shall have withdrawn or modified its recommendation of this
Agreement or the Merger).

5.4   ACCESS TO INFORMATION

            (a) Target shall afford Acquiror and its accountants, counsel and
other representatives, access during normal business hours and upon reasonable
prior notice during the period prior to the Effective Time to (i) all of
Target's and its subsidiaries' properties, books,



                                       38
<PAGE>

contracts, commitments and records, and (ii) all other information concerning
the business, properties and personnel of Target and its subsidiaries as the
other party may reasonably request. Target agrees to provide to Acquiror and its
accountants, counsel and other representatives copies of available internal
financial statements promptly upon request. Acquiror and its representatives
shall keep such information confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

            (b) Subject to compliance with applicable law and the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the
parties shall confer on a regular and frequent basis with one or more
representatives of the other party to report operational matters of materiality
and the general status of ongoing operations of the Target.

            (c) Acquiror and Target shall promptly furnish or make available to
each other a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement or other
document filed by it after the date of this Agreement pursuant to the
requirements of Federal or state securities laws.

            (d) No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation
pursuant to this Section 5.4 or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

5.5   CONFIDENTIALITY

      The parties acknowledge that Acquiror and Target have previously executed
the Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

5.6   PUBLIC DISCLOSURE

      Unless otherwise permitted by this Agreement, Acquiror and Target shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statement or making any other public (or non-confidential) disclosure
(whether or not in response to an inquiry) regarding the terms of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither shall issue any such press
release or make any such statement or disclosure without the prior written
approval of the other (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except as may be required by applicable law or to comply with the
rules and regulations of the SEC or any obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or with Nasdaq, in which event,
the party who is required to make disclosure shall notify the other party as
soon as reasonably possible of the nature and timing of the required disclosure.
Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement to the
contrary, any party to this Agreement (and their employees, representatives, or
other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any
kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Transactions") and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax
treatment and tax structure; provided, however, that this sentence shall not
permit any disclosure that otherwise is prohibited by this Agreement (i) until
the earlier of (x) the date of the public announcement of discussions relating
to the Transactions, (y) the date of the public announcement of the
Transactions, and (z) the date of the execution of an agreement (with or without
conditions) to enter into the Transactions; or (ii) if such disclosure would
result in a violation of federal or state



                                       39
<PAGE>

securities laws; or (iii) to the extent not related to the tax aspects of the
transaction. Moreover, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit in
any way any party's ability to consult any tax advisor regarding the tax
treatment or tax structure of the Transactions.

5.7   CONSENTS; COOPERATION

            (a) Each of Acquiror and Target shall promptly apply for or
otherwise seek, and use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, all
consents and approvals (including, without limitation, all consents and
approvals required by United States and foreign governmental or regulatory
agencies) required to be obtained by it for the consummation of the Merger,
including those required under HSR, and shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals under, or to
deliver notice of the Merger as required by, any of their respective material
contracts in connection with the Merger for the assignment thereof or otherwise.
The parties hereto will consult with, and provide the necessary information to,
one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on
behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to
HSR or any other federal, state or foreign antitrust or fair trade law.

            (b) Each of Acquiror and Target shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under HSR, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other Federal, state or
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). In
connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of
Acquiror and Target shall cooperate and use all commercially reasonable efforts
vigorously to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent (each an "Order"), that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, conditions or restricts consummation
of the Merger or any such other transactions, unless by mutual agreement
Acquiror and Target decide that litigation is not in their respective best
interests. Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence,
it is expressly understood and agreed that neither Acquiror nor Target shall
have any obligation to litigate or contest any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding or any Order beyond the earlier of (i) September 30, 2003, or (ii)
the date of a ruling preliminarily enjoining the Merger issued by a court of
competent jurisdiction. Each of Acquiror and Target shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under the HSR or other Antitrust Laws with
respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this
Agreement.

            (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Acquiror nor Target shall
be required to agree, as a condition to any approval, to accept any operational
restriction or divest itself of or hold separate any subsidiary, division or
business unit that is material to the business of such party and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or if such restriction, divestiture or holding


                                       40
<PAGE>

separate would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on such
party or result in a material adverse effect on the benefits intended to be
derived as a result of the Merger.

5.8   SHAREHOLDER LISTS

      Section 5.8 of the Target Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of those
persons or entities who are on the date hereof and who are anticipated at the
time of the Shareholder Meeting to be, "affiliates" of Target within the meaning
of Rule 145 under the Securities Act ("Rule 145"). Each such person or entity
who is an "affiliate" of Target within the meaning of Rule 145 is referred to
herein as an "Affiliate". Target shall provide such information and documents as
Acquiror shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list and shall
notify Acquiror in writing regarding any change in the identity of its
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date. Target shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each person or entity who is identified as an
Affiliate of Target to deliver to Acquiror, no less than twenty Business Days
prior to the date of the Target Shareholders Meeting, a written agreement in
connection with restrictions on Affiliates under Rule 145, in form attached
hereto as Exhibit B.

5.9   INDEMNIFICATION

            (a) The Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification of present and former directors, officers and employees of
Target than those set forth in Target's Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation on
the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder as of the Effective
Time of individuals who at the Effective Time are present or former directors,
officers or employees of Target, unless such modification is required after the
Effective Time by applicable law.

            (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and
the Acquiror jointly and severally shall indemnify and hold harmless each
present and former director, officer and employee of Target (each, together with
each such person's heirs, executors or administrators, an "Indemnified Party"
and collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses
(including, prior to the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (collectively, "Actions"), (i) arising out of or
pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) otherwise
with respect to any acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, in each case, only to the extent provided in Target's Articles of
Incorporation or By-Laws as in effect on the date hereof, in each case for a
period of six years after the Effective Time; provided, however, that, any claim
or claims for indemnification in accordance with this Section 5.9(b) shall
continue until the disposition of any such claims. In the event of any Action
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Parties
shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation in writing, and the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, including the
employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Parties. The
Indemnified Parties shall have the right to employ separate counsel, in any such
Action and to participate in (but not control) the defense thereof, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel



                                       41
<PAGE>

shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Parties unless (A) the Surviving
Corporation has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (B) the Surviving
Corporation shall have failed to assume the defense of such Action, or (C) the
named parties to any such Action (including any impleaded parties) include both
the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties and such Indemnified
Parties shall have been reasonably advised in writing by counsel that there may
be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Parties which are in
conflict with those available to the Surviving Corporation. In the event such
Indemnified Parties employ separate counsel at the expense of the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to clauses (B) or (C) of the previous sentence, (w) any
counsel retained by the Indemnified Parties for any period after the Effective
Time shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation; (x) the
Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them in
each applicable jurisdiction with respect to any single Action unless there is,
under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties,
in which case each Indemnified Person with respect to whom such a conflict
exists (or group of such Indemnified Persons who among them have no such
conflict) may retain one separate law firm in each applicable jurisdiction; (y)
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel, promptly after statements therefore are
received; and (z) the Surviving Corporation will cooperate in the defense of any
such Action. Neither the Acquiror nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
for any settlement of any such Action effected without their prior written
consent.

            (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Acquiror and
the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to
be maintained in effect directors and officers liability insurance covering
those persons who are currently covered by policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by Target on terms substantially similar to those
applicable under such current policies with respect to claims arising from and
related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time
provided, however, that in no event will Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation
be required to expend in excess of $300,000 in the aggregate (i.e. for six years
coverage) for such coverage (or such coverage as is available for such
$300,000).

            (d) In the event Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or any
successor to Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any person or
entity, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors of the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation honor the obligations of
the Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 5.9.

            (e) The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the

      (d) Acquiror and Target shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to

5.11  NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS

      Target shall give prompt notice to Acquiror, and Acquiror shall give
prompt notice to Target, of (a) any event or occurrence of which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or to cause any
representation or warranty by such party contained in this Agreement to be
materially untrue or inaccurate, or (b) any failure of Target, Acquiror or
Merger Sub, as the case may be, materially to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.11 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice; and provided further that failure
to give such notice shall not be treated as a breach of covenant for the
purposes of this Agreement unless the failure to give such notice results in
material prejudice to the other party.

5.12  STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

            (a) At the Effective Time, the Target Stock Option Plans and each
outstanding option to purchase shares of Target Common Stock under the Target
Stock Option Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall be, and they hereby are,
assumed by Acquiror. Section 5.12 of the Target Disclosure Letter sets forth a
true and correct schedule (the "Option Schedule") as of the date hereof (and as
of the Closing Date) of all holders of outstanding options under the Target
Stock Option Plans, the number of shares of Target Common Stock subject to each
such option, the exercise or vesting schedule of each such option, the exercise
price per share of each such option, and the term of each such option. Each such
option so assumed by Acquiror under this Agreement shall continue to have, and
be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in (1) the Target Stock
Option Plans, (2) the terms and conditions of each grant and (3) the option
agreements evidencing, or other agreements relating to, such options (the items
set forth clauses (2) and (3), an "Option Agreement") immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that (i) such option shall be exercisable for that number
of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the product of the number of
shares of Target Common Stock that were issuable upon



                                       43
<PAGE>

exercise of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the quotient (such quotient, the "Option Ratio") of $17.50 divided by the
quotient of $3.50 divided by the Exchange Ratio, and rounded to the nearest
whole number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, (ii) the per share exercise
price for the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
option shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price
per share of Target Common Stock at which such option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Option Ratio, rounded to the
nearest whole cent, and (iii) in the case of only the May 2001 options, such
options shall be fully vested and exercisable. The following is an illustrative
example for a Target stock option for 50 shares of Target Common Stock with an
exercise price of $10.00 per share and assuming an Average Stock Price of
$24.00:

                  Exchange Ratio: $3.50 /  $24.00  =  0.1458
                  Option Ratio:  $17.50 /  ($3.50  /  0.1458)  =  0.7291
                  Adjusted number of shares:  50  x  0.7291 =  36 shares
                  Adjusted exercise price:  $10.00 / 0.7291 =  $13.72

            (b) The options so assumed by Acquiror are intended to qualify
following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in Section
422 of the Code to the extent such options qualified as incentive stock options
prior to the Effective Time. As soon as practicable, and in any event within
thirty days, after the Effective Time, Acquiror will issue to each person whose
option was assumed in accordance with this Section 5.12, a document evidencing
the foregoing assumption of such option by Acquiror. Acquiror shall take all
corporate action necessary to reserve and make available for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock for delivery under Target
Stock Options assumed in accordance with this Section 5.12. Within twenty
Business Days after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall file a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) which will
register the shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to assumed options to the
extent permitted by Federal securities laws and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding.

            (c) Outstanding purchase rights under the Target ESPP shall be
exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each participant in the
Target ESPP accordingly shall be issued shares of Target Common Stock at that
time in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section 5.12(c) and the
Target ESPP, which shares of Target Common Stock shall be converted into the
right to receive shares of Acquiror Common Stock in the Merger in accordance
with the terms hereof. On or prior to the Effective Time, Target shall have
taken all action necessary to terminate the Target ESPP on the last Business Day
of the pay period immediately preceding the Effective Time (such Business Day,
the "ESPP Termination Date"), and, for all purposes, notwithstanding the terms
of the Target ESPP, no purchase rights shall be granted or exercised under the
Target ESPP subsequent to the ESPP Termination Date.

the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all

Surviving Corporation or Acquiror, employees of the Surviving Corporation or

amounts no less favorable, in the aggregate, to such employees than are paid to
other employees of Acquiror at equivalent levels, (ii) be eligible for
participation in Acquiror's bonus plan at levels that, at a minimum, equal the
bonuses for which such employees were eligible immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (iii) not have their respective annual base salaries reduced

            (b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting

shall receive service credit for service with Acquiror for all past service

accrued benefits and no duplication of benefits).

5.16  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

      Target shall cooperate with Acquiror in all reasonable respects in
connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Registration

thereof). Without limiting the foregoing, Target shall (a) prepare interim
financial statements for Target and its subsidiaries ("Interim Financials"), if
required in connection with the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement that
are suitable for inclusion by Acquiror in the Public Filings (as defined below),
including compliance with the applicable provisions of Regulation S-X, (b) use
its best efforts to obtain written consents of its independent public
accountants, when required, with respect to the Target Financial Statements



                                       45
<PAGE>

and any Interim Financials so that such financial statements can be used in
registration statements filed under the Securities Act and reports under the
Securities Exchange Act ("Public Filings"), issued or filed by Acquiror, and (c)
cooperate with Acquiror so Acquiror can obtain information sufficient for
Acquiror to comply with the requirements of the Management's Discussion and
Analysis portion of the Public Filings, as it may relate to Target and its
subsidiaries.

terminating party to the other party), whether before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Target:

            (a) by mutual written consent of Target and Acquiror;

            (b) by either Target or Acquiror, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by October 31, 2003 (the "Outside Date") (provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any
party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been a
significant cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or
before the Outside Date);

            (c) by Acquiror, if the consent to assignment of or change of
control obtained with respect to the three Affiliate Services Agreements with
Experian Information Solutions, Inc.



                                       49
<PAGE>

            (e) by either Acquiror or Target, if at the Shareholder Meeting
(including any adjournment or postponement), the requisite vote of the
shareholders of Target in favor of this Agreement and the Merger (the "Target
Shareholder Approval") shall not have been obtained (provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(e) shall not be available to
Target where the failure to obtain Target Shareholder Approval shall have been
caused by the action or failure to act of Target and such action or failure to
act constitutes a material breach by Target of this Agreement or shall have been
caused by a breach of any Voting Agreement). A material breach by Target of

withdrawn or modified its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger in a
manner adverse to Acquiror; (ii) the Board of Directors of Target fails to

forty-five days after such tender or exchange offer is first published, sent or
given, a statement disclosing that Target recommends rejection of such tender or
exchange offer; or (v) for any other reason Target fails to call and hold the
Shareholder Meeting in accordance with Section 5.3 hereof;

            (g) by Acquiror, if any representation or warranty of Target shall
have become untrue such that the condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) (i) would
not be satisfied (a "Target Terminating Change"), or by Target, if any
representation or warranty of Acquiror and Merger Sub shall have become untrue
such that the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a)(i) would not be satisfied
(an "Acquiror Terminating Change" and together with a Target Terminating Change,
a "Terminating Change"); provided, however, that if any such Terminating Change
is curable prior to the date first established by Target for the Shareholder
Meeting to occur through the exercise of Target's or Acquiror's commercially
reasonable efforts, as the case may be, and for so long as Target or Acquiror,
as the case may be, continues to exercise such commercially reasonable efforts,
neither Acquiror nor Target, respectively, may terminate this Agreement under
this Section 7.1(g) until at least fifteen days (or the remaining number of days
prior to the Outside Date, if shorter) have elapsed following receipt of the
written notice of termination pursuant to this Section 7.1(g);

            (h) by Target or Acquiror, if there has been a breach of any
covenant or agreement on the part of the other party set forth in this
Agreement, which breach (i) would cause the condition set forth in Section
6.2(a)(ii) (in the case of termination by Target) or in



                                       50
<PAGE>

6.3(a)(ii) (in the case of termination by Acquiror) not to be satisfied, and
(ii) except in the case of a breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in
Section 5.1 (as to which breach this clause (ii) shall not be applicable), shall
not have been cured within fifteen days (or prior to the Outside Date, if
earlier) following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such
breach from the other party;

            (i) by Target, if it accepts or proposes to accept, or recommends to
shareholders, a Superior Proposal; provided that simultaneously with such
termination Target complies with Section 7.2(b)(ii) hereof; or

            (j) by Target, if (i) the Average Stock Price is less than $23.85,
(ii) at or before 5:00 P.M. (Eastern Time) on the date which is two trading days
(on the Nasdaq National Market) prior to the Shareholder Meeting and Target
delivers to Acquiror written notice, subject to the following clause (iii),
terminating this Agreement (the "Target's Notice") and such Target's Notice is
not withdrawn in writing prior to the Shareholder Meeting and (iii) Acquiror has
not agreed, by written notice to Target (the "Acquiror's Notice") given at or
before 5:00 P.M. (Eastern Time) one trading day prior to the Shareholder
Meeting, to convert, in the Merger, each share of Target Common Stock (other
than any shares of Target Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(c)
or any shares of Target Common Stock to which dissenters' rights have been
exercised pursuant to Section 1.6(g)) into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration Per Share and the fraction of one fully paid and non-assessable
share of Acquiror Common Stock (subject to Section 1.6(f) hereof) equal to, at
minimum, a fraction (rounded to four decimal places, with the number five and
below being rounded down), the numerator of which is $3.50 and the denominator
of which is the Average Stock Price. In the event that Acquiror delivers an
Acquiror's Notice, Target shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(j), and the Target's Notice shall have no force or
effect.

7.2   EFFECT OF TERMINATION

      In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void, the Merger shall be abandoned and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Acquiror, Merger Sub or
Target or their respective officers, directors, shareholders or other
Affiliates, except as otherwise set forth in Section 7.3 and except to the
extent that such termination results from the intentional breach by a party
hereto of any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this
Agreement (in which case the nonbreaching party may seek any and all remedies
available to it under applicable law); provided that, the provisions of Section
5.5, Section 7.3 and this Section 7.2 shall remain in full force and effect and
survive any termination of this Agreement.
