 (b) At the Effective Time of the Merger, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror or Merger Sub, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   

 (c) Subject to the adjustments set forth in Sections 2.4 and 2.5, the " _Merger Consideration_ " shall consist of Three Hundred Ten Million Dollars ($310,000,000) (the " _Gross Merger Consideration_ ") in cash, _less_ (i) the Estimated Funded Debt (as defined below), _plus_ (ii) the Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents (as defined below), _less_ (iii) the amount of Holder Allocable Expenses paid by Acquiror to Holdings at Closing in accordance with Section 2.6.

Upon (1) payment by Acquiror to the Exchange Agent of the Funding Amount and (2) payment by Acquiror to Holdings of the estimated Holder Allocable Expenses pursuant to Section 2.6, Acquiror shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations to make payments in respect of the Merger Consideration other than (A) Acquirors obligation to make payments required by Section 2.5 and (B) the obligation of Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation to make payments to Dissenting Common Stockholders, if any, following the Effective Time of the Merger.   

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time of the Merger but in any event not later than three Business Days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to (i) each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger represented outstanding Common Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") and (ii) each holder of Options, in each case whose Common Shares and/or Options, as applicable, were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Annex B_  (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (B) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates (or, in the case of a holder of Options, a Holder Acknowledgement) in exchange for the Merger Consideration. After the Effective Time of the Merger, each holder of any Certificates and/or Options, upon surrender of such Certificates together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent (or, in the case of a holder of Options, upon delivery of a Holder Acknowledgment to the Exchange Agent), shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent in exchange therefor (subject to the provisions of Section 2.5) such portion of the Merger Consideration into which such holders Common Shares and/or Options shall have been converted as a result of the Merger;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any payment with respect to Options held by employees of the Company or its Affiliates (" _Employee Options_ ") shall be reduced by the amount of any taxes required to be withheld under applicable law with respect to such payments and amounts so withheld shall be paid by the Exchange Agent to the Company for disbursement to the applicable taxing authority; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , (x) a portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to each holder of Common Shares and/or Options equal to the Working Capital Escrow Amount _multiplied by_ such holders Applicable Percentage shall be held in escrow in accordance with Section 2.5(d) and the Escrow Agreement and (y) a portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to holders of Common Shares and Options equal to the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow in    #####

forgoing, in the event that any holder of Common Shares or Options

duly executed Letter of Transmittal) and/or a Holder Acknowledgement with
respect to such Options to Acquiror at the Closing, Acquiror shall pay the
amount which such holder is entitled in consideration therefor directly to
such holder at the Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds
(pursuant to written wire transfer instructions delivered by such holder to
Acquiror not fewer than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date)

amounts (subject, in the case of any Employee Options to withholding for
taxes, which amounts shall be paid to the Company for disbursement to the
applicable taxing authority, and reduction for any amounts required to be
placed in escrow in accordance with Sections 2.5(d) and 2.5(e)). Pending such
surrender and exchange (or, in the case of a holder of Options, upon such
delivery of a Holder Acknowledgment), a holders Certificates and/or Options
shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence only the right to receive such
holders portion of the Merger Consideration into which such Common Shares
and/or Options shall have been converted by the Merger. Subject to Section
2.2(f), under no circumstances will the holder of any Certificates and/or
Options be entitled to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration until
such holder has surrendered such Certificates (together with a duly executed
Letter of Transmittal) and/or Holder Acknowledgement, as applicable, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II. No dividend or
other distributions with respect to any common stock of the Surviving
Corporation with a record date after the Effective Time of the Merger shall
be paid with respect to any unsurrendered Certificate, and no holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Options shall be entitled to any interest with
respect to any portion of the Merger Consideration.

If, after the Effective Time of the Merger, Certificates or Options are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, except as otherwise provided by applicable law.   

 (d) _Undistributed Funding Amount_. Any portion of the Funding Amount which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Options for six (6) months after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be delivered to Acquiror, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Options who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Acquiror for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration.   

 (e) _No Liability_. None of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock, any dividends or distributions with respect thereto or any cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   

 (f) _Lost Certificate_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Acquiror, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Acquiror may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement.    #####

In the event that Holdings does not provide such a notice of disagreement within such thirty (30) day period, Holdings shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt and the Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents delivered by Acquiror, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such notice of disagreement is timely provided, Acquiror and Holdings shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt and the Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents. If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then KPMG LLP (or such other independent accounting firm of recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by Acquiror and Holdings) (the " _Auditor_ ") shall resolve any remaining disagreements. The Auditor shall determine as promptly as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days of the date on which such dispute is referred to the Auditor, whether the Closing Balance Sheet was prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 2.5(a) and (only with respect to the remaining disagreements submitted to the Auditor) whether and to what extent (if any) the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt and the Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents requires adjustment. The fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be paid one-half by Acquiror and one-half by Holdings as a Holder Allocable Expense pursuant to Section 2.6. The determination of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The date on which the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt and the Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents is finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.5(b) is hereinafter referred as to the " _Determination Date_."   

 (c) The " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative, shall mean (i) the Closing Date Net Working Capital _minus_ the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital, plus (ii) the Estimated Funded Debt _minus_ the Closing Date Funded Debt, _plus_ (iii) the Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents _minus_ the Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents. If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Merger Consideration will be increased by the Adjustment Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Merger Consideration will be decreased by the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount.   

 (d) _Working Capital Escrow_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article II, on the Closing Date, Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) of the Merger Consideration (the " _Working Capital Escrow Amount_ ") otherwise payable to the holders of Common Shares and Options listed on _Schedule 2.5_ (the " _Escrow Participating Holders_ ") shall be paid by Acquiror to Deutsche Bank AG, as escrow agent of the parties hereto (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") to be held in escrow pending determination of the Adjustment Amount. The Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be held and invested by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of an escrow agreement in the form attached hereto as _Annex D_ hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). Upon final determination of the Adjustment    ##### 

  

  

Amount in accordance with Section 2.5(b) hereof, each of Acquiror and
Holdings shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Working Capital Escrow Amount as
set forth in this Section 2.5(d). If the Adjustment Amount is a positive
number, then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days of the Determination Date, (i) the Escrow Agent
shall pay to the Escrow Participating Holders (pro rata, in accordance with
their respective Applicable Percentages) the Working Capital Escrow Amount,
together with all interest earned thereon, and (ii) Acquiror shall pay to the
Escrow Participating Holders (pro rata, in accordance with their respective
Applicable Percentages) the Adjustment Amount, as finally determined,
together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment
at the rate of interest published in the "Money Rates" column of the Eastern
Edition of _The Wall Street Journal_ (or the average of such rates if more
than one rate is indicated) on the Closing Date. If the Adjustment Amount is
a negative number, then, promptly following the Determination Date, and
in any event within five (5) Business Days of the Determination Date, (A)
the Escrow Agent shall pay to Acquiror out of the Working Capital Escrow
Amount an amount equal to the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount,
together with all interest earned on the absolute value of the Adjustment
Amount, and (B) if the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount is less than
the Working Capital Escrow Amount, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Escrow
Participating Holders (pro rata, in accordance with their respective
Applicable Percentages) the balance of the Working Capital Escrow Amount,
together with any interest earned thereon. In no event shall Holdings or any
holder of Common Shares and/or Options have any liability under this Section
2.5 in excess of such holders allocable share of the Working Capital Escrow
Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any distributions to the holders of
Options pursuant to this Section 2.5(d) shall be net of the amount of any
taxes required to be withheld from such distributions under applicable law,
and the amounts so withheld shall be paid over to the Company for payment by
the Company to the applicable Governmental Authority as required by law. In
no event shall Acquiror be entitled to payment pursuant to this Section
2.5(d) of any amount in excess of the Working Capital Escrow Amount, plus all
interest earned thereon.   

 (e) _Indemnification Escrow_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article II, on the Closing Date, Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) of the Merger Consideration (the " _Indemnification Escrow Amount_ " and, together with the Working Capital Escrow Amount, the " _Escrow Amount_ ") otherwise payable to the Escrow Participating Holders shall be paid by Acquiror to the Escrow Agent to be held in escrow to serve as the sole source of payment of claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2(a). The Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be held and invested by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, which shall specify that the funds held therein (if any) shall be released to the Escrow Participating Holders on the first Business Day following the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any claim by an Indemnified Party for reimbursement pursuant to Article XII shall have been asserted pursuant to this Agreement and at that time remain pending, the funds on deposit released to Escrow Participating Holders shall be the amount of funds then on deposit minus the aggregate amount of claims that have been so asserted and remain pending.   

 Section 2.6 Holder Allocable Expenses. On or prior to the Closing Date, Holdings will provide to Acquiror an estimate (which estimate shall include such reserves as Holdings determines in good faith to be appropriate for any Holder Allocable Expenses that are not then known or determinable) of the following fees and expenses that may be incurred by Holdings on behalf of the Company and the holders of the Common Shares and/or Options in connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby: (a) the fees and disbursements of special outside counsel to the Company and/or Holdings incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) the fees and expenses of any other agents, advisors, consultants and experts employed by the Company and/or Holdings in connection with the Merger, (c) if necessary, one-half of the fees and expenses of the Auditor and (d) the expenses of Holdings incurred in    ##### 

  

  

its capacity as Holder Representative (the " _Holder Allocable Expenses_ ").
On the Closing Date, Acquiror shall pay to Holdings cash in the amount of
such estimated Holder Allocable Expenses and Holdings shall use such cash to
pay the Holder Allocable Expenses. In no event will Holdings (or, following
the Effective Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation and its
Affiliates) be responsible for payment of Holder Allocable Expenses in excess
of the cash amounts paid to Holdings by Acquiror under this Section 2.6.

 (c) _Confidential Transaction_. The parties hereto agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating to confidentiality do not cause the Transactions to be a "confidential transaction" as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation § 1.6011-4(b)(3).   

 Section 7.2 Support of Transaction. Acquiror and the Company shall each (and shall each cause their respective Affiliates to) (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to assemble, prepare and file any information (and, as needed, to supplement such information) as may be reasonably necessary to obtain as promptly as practicable all governmental and regulatory consents required to be obtained in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all material consents and approvals of third parties that any of Acquiror, the Company, or their respective Affiliates are required to obtain in order to consummate the Merger, and (c) take such other action as may reasonably be necessary or as another party may reasonably request to satisfy the conditions of Article IX or otherwise to comply with this Agreement.

 (c) Holdings shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and submit for review, comment and execution by Acquiror any Tax Return relating to any Tax obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any period ending on or before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Return_ "). Any such income Pre-Closing Tax Return shall be so submitted within thirty (30) days prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be filed (taking into account all applicable extensions), and any non-income Tax Return shall be so submitted within ten (10) days prior to the date such non-income Pre-Closing Tax Return is required to be filed (taking into account all applicable extensions) provided that if any such non-income Pre-Closing Tax Return is due to be filed within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, such non-income    ##### 

  

  

Pre-Closing Tax Return shall be submitted promptly after such Tax Return has
been prepared. Acquiror shall timely file, or shall cause to be timely filed,
all Pre-Closing Tax Returns and shall not revise or otherwise modify any such
Pre-Closing Tax Return without the prior written consent of Holdings. All Tax
Returns for any taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing

manner consistent with past practice and, on such Tax Returns, no position
shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with
positions taken, elections made or methods used in preparing and filing
similar Tax Returns for prior periods, except as required by applicable law.
Acquiror shall permit Holdings to review and comment on each such Tax Return
described in the preceding sentence. Acquiror shall deliver such Straddle
Period income Tax Returns to Holdings within thirty (30) days prior to filing

respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date
(or with respect to any Straddle Period) without the prior written consent of
Holdings, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.   

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of any Straddle Period beginning before and ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any property or _ad valorem_ Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case of any other Tax (including any income Taxes or sales and use Taxes), be deemed equal to the amount which would by payable as computed on a "closing-of-the-books" basis if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date.   

 (e) The parties hereto agree that the transactions that occur on the Closing Date and that are permitted, required or expressly contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Transactions_ ") are properly allocable to the portion of the Closing Date preceding the Closing. Accordingly, the "next day rule" provided by Treasury Regulation §1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) is inapplicable to the Transactions. Without limitation of the foregoing, the transfer of the Excluded Business as provided for in Section 5.5 and the cashing out of the unvested options as provided in Section 2.1(a) are each properly allocable to the portion of the Closing Date preceding the Closing, and all income and deductions related thereto are includable in the taxable year of the Company ending at the close of business on the Closing Date. No election under Treasury Section Regulation. §1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) shall be made in connection with the Transactions. Acquiror will not effect any transaction on the Closing Date (other than a transaction required or expressly contemplated by this Agreement) that could result in Tax liability to Holdings, the Company or its Subsidiaries in excess of the Tax liability associated with the conduct of the Companys and its Subsidiaries business in the ordinary course.   

 (f) Acquiror shall promptly notify Holdings in writing upon receipt by Acquiror or its Affiliates (including, without limitation, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries) of any notice of any audits, examinations, adjustments or assessments relating to Taxes of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries (or any of their successors) for which Acquiror or its Affiliates may be entitled to receive indemnity under this Agreement (a " _Tax Action_ "). Acquirors failure to notify Holdings will not relieve Holdings or any other Person of any liability that it may have, except to the extent the defense of such Tax Action is materially and irrevocably prejudiced by Acquirors failure to give such notice. Such notice shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the relevant taxing authority. Holdings may elect at any time to represent the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their successors) in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to    ##### 

  

  

taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date (a " _Seller s Tax
Contest_"), and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense, _provided_
that Holdings may not agree to settle any Sellers Tax Consent without
Acquirors consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. If Holdings chooses to direct a Sellers Tax Contest, Acquiror shall
cause powers of attorney authorizing Holdings to represent the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, before the relevant
taxing authority and such other documents as are reasonably necessary for
Holdings to control the conduct of any Sellers Tax Contest. In the case of
any Straddle Period, Holdings shall be entitled to participate at its expense
in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating (in whole or
in part) to Taxes attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending
on and including the Closing Date. None of Acquiror or any of its Affiliates
(including without limitation the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries)
may agree to settle any Tax claim which may be or is the subject of an
Indemnification Claim by the Acquiror or its Affiliates without the
prior written consent of Holdings, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. To the extent there is a conflict between any provision
of this Section 7.5 and Section 12.3, the provisions of this Section 7.5
shall control.   

 (g) Any information obtained by a party pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall be kept confidential by such party, except to the extent disclosure is required in connection with the filing of any Tax Return or claims for refunds or in connection with the conduct of an audit, or other proceedings in response to an audit, by a taxing jurisdiction, or otherwise required by law or binding judicial order.   

 Section 7.6 Certain Employment Agreements. If, on the Closing Date, Acquiror irrevocably offers to each employee of the Company listed on _Schedule 7.6_ to enter into severance and non-competition agreements in the form attached as  _Exhibits A_ through _E_ , respectively, to that certain letter from Acquiror to the Company dated as of the date hereof (the " _Severance and Non-Compete Agreements_ "), on or before the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company shall cause each of the employment agreements listed in _Schedule 7.6_ to be terminated.   

 Section 7.7 Sourcing Agreements. On the Closing Date, (i) Holdings will cause Relizon to execute and deliver to Acquiror each of the agreements attached hereto as _Annex G_ , _Annex H_ and _Annex I_ (together, the " _Sourcing Agreements_ ") and (ii) the Company shall, and Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, execute and deliver to Relizon the Sourcing Agreements.   

 Section 7.8 Representation Insurance. Each party acknowledges that Acquiror may seek to obtain an insurance policy covering Damages arising out of any breach of any representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement (the " _Representation and Warranty Policy_ "). In the event that Acquiror obtains the Representation and Warranty Policy on or before the Closing Date, either (i) the Company will reimburse Acquiror for one-half of the premiums paid by Acquiror on or prior to the Closing Date to obtain such policy or (ii) one-half of the premiums paid by Acquiror on or prior to the Closing Date to obtain such policy shall be reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet; _provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate premiums paid by Acquiror to obtain such policy shall not exceed $2,000,000.   

 Section 7.9 Shared Agreements. The parties hereto acknowledge that (a) Relizon is party to the Contracts listed on _Schedule 7.9_ (the " _Shared Relizon Agreements_ ") that provide for the leasing of certain equipment and the provision of certain services to Relizon and certain of its Affiliates, (b) the Company is a party to the Contracts listed on _Schedule 7.9_ (the " _Shared Company Agreements_ " and, together with the Shared Relizon Agreements, the " _Shared Agreements_ ") that provide for the leasing of certain equipment and the provision of services to the Company and its Affiliates, (c) certain equipment and services leased or provided pursuant to the Shared Relizon Agreements are made available to and used by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to subcontract or similar arrangement between Relizon and the Company and (d) certain equipment and services leased or provided pursuant to the    ##### 

  

  

Shared Company Agreements are made available and used by Relizon and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to subcontract or similar arrangement between the
Company and Relizon. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the
Company and Acquiror shall, and Holdings shall cause Relizon to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to amend the Shared Agreements (or, to the
extent appropriate, modify and replace the Shared Agreements) so that,
following the Closing, (i) the equipment and services provided under the
Shared Relizon Agreements that are currently made available to and used by
the Company and its Subsidiaries will be made available to the Company and
its Subsidiaries directly by the third party provider of such equipment or
services pursuant to Contracts between the Company and such provider or
indirectly pursuant to formal subcontract arrangements between Relizon and
the Company, (ii) the equipment and services provided under the Shared
Company Agreements that are currently made available to and used by Relizon
and its Subsidiaries will be made available to Relizon and its Subsidiaries
directly by the third party provider of such equipment or services pursuant
to Contracts between Relizon and such provider or indirectly pursuant to
formal subcontract arrangements between the Company and Relizon, (iii)
Relizon shall not be responsible for the performance of (or will
be indemnified by the Company for) any obligations under the Shared
Relizon Agreements relating to products or services made available to or used
by the Company and its Subsidiaries and (iv) the Company shall not be
responsible for the performance of (or will be indemnified by Relizon for)
any obligations under the Shared Company Agreements relating to products or
services made available or used by Relizon or its Subsidiaries.

The parties    ##### 

  

    

have designated Holdings as the initial Holder Representative, and approval
of this Agreement by the holders of Common Shares and Options shall
constitute ratification and approval of such designation. The Holder
Representative may resign at any time, and the Holder Representative may be
removed by the vote of Persons which collectively owned more than fifty
percent (50%) of the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common Shares at the Effective
Time of the Merger (" _Majority Holders_ "). In the event that a Holder

ARTICLE XII. 
 INDEMNIFICATION    

 Section 12.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Each representation and warranty contained herein and any certificate related to such representations and warranties will survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect for eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date. Each covenant and obligation in this Agreement and any certificate or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Closing for a period of eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date. No claim for indemnification for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement may be asserted pursuant to this Agreement unless (i) such claim is asserted in writing on or before the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date and (ii) such claim is made in respect of Damages incurred prior to the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date or, to the    ##### 

  

    

extent arising out of a third party claim (including any claim by
any Governmental Authority) asserted in writing prior to the date that is
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, such claim is made in respect of
Damages reasonably expected to arise in connection with such claim.   

 Section 12.2 Indemnification.   

 (a) Acquiror and its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, representatives, controlling persons and stockholders (collectively, the " _Acquiror Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be entitled to indemnification solely from the Indemnification Escrow Amount for any and all Damages to the extent attributable to (i) any breach of any representation or warranty the Company has made in this Agreement or any breach or inaccuracy as of the Closing Date of any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement, (ii) any breach, violation or default by the Company or Holdings of any covenant, agreement or obligation of the Company or Holdings in this Agreement or (iii) the failure of the Company to obtain any consent required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby under the Contracts listed in _Schedule 12.2_.   

 (b) Acquiror shall indemnify and hold Holdings and other stockholders of the Company and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, representatives, controlling persons and stockholders (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless for any and all Damages to the extent attributable to (i) any breach of any representation or warranty Acquiror or Merger Sub has made in this Agreement or any breach or inaccuracy as of the Closing Date of any representation or warranty made by Acquiror or Merger Sub in this Agreement or (ii) any breach, violation or default by the Parent, Acquiror or Merger Sub of any covenant, agreement or obligation of the Parent, Acquiror or Merger Sub in this Agreement.   

 Section 12.3 Indemnification Claim Procedures. If any Action is commenced or threatened that may give rise to a claim for indemnification (an " _Indemnification Claim_ ") by any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any Person obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Party (an " _Indemnitor_ "), then such Indemnified Party will promptly give notice to the Indemnitor. Failure to notify the Indemnitor will not relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent the defense of such Action is materially and irrevocably prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice. An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and thereafter conduct the defense of any Action subject to any such Indemnification Claim with counsel of the Indemnitors choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and to settle or compromise any such Action; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnitor will not approve of the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to the Indemnification Claim without the Indemnified Partys prior written approval (which must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that it will not be deemed to be unreasonable for an Indemnified Party to withhold its consent if such judgment or settlement includes any finding of or admission of any violation of any law, order or permit). Until an Indemnitor assumes the defense of the Indemnification Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend against the Indemnification Claim in any manner the Indemnified Party reasonably deems appropriate. If the Indemnified Party gives an Indemnitor notice of an Indemnification Claim and the Indemnitor does not, within thirty (30) days after such notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of the Action or Actions subject to such Indemnification Claim and thereafter promptly assumes such defense, then the Indemnitor will be bound by any judicial determination made with respect to the Action or Actions subject to such Indemnification Claim or any compromise or settlement of the Action or Actions subject to such Indemnification Claim effected by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party will not agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to the Action or Actions subject to any such Indemnification Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). A claim for any matter not involving a third party may be    ##### 

  

    

asserted by written notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any Indemnification Claim in respect of any
actual or alleged breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein must be asserted prior to the expiration of the survival
period provided for in Section 12.1. To the extent the defense of any Action
subject to any Indemnification Claim is assumed by the Holder Representative
as the Indemnitor, the costs and expenses of such defense shall be paid from
the Indemnification Escrow Amount and Acquiror, the Company and the Holder
Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse such portion of
the Indemnification Escrow Amount as is reasonably requested in writing by
the Holder Representative to pay such costs and expenses.   

 Section 12.4 Limitations on Indemnification Liability. Any claims an Indemnified Party makes under this Article XII will be limited as follows:   

 (a) _Ceiling_. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the aggregate amount of Damages for which the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XII will not exceed the Indemnification Escrow Amount. The Indemnification Escrow Amount shall serve as the sole and exclusive source of payment of any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2(a). Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the aggregate amount of Damages for which the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XII will not exceed $10,000,000.   

 (b) _Claims Basket_. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification for Damages pursuant to this Article XII unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages for which the Acquiror Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XII (other than for claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2(a)(iii)) exceed $500,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), and the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification for such Damages to the extent such Damages exceed the Basket Amount. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification for Damages pursuant to this Article XII unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages for which the Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XII exceed the Basket Amount, and the Seller Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification for such Damages to the extent such Damages exceed the Basket Amount.   

 (c) _Damages Net of Insurance Proceeds and Tax Benefits_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, all Damages for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to indemnification under this Article XII shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds or Tax benefits received by any Indemnified Party in respect of any Damages incurred by such Indemnified Party. In the event that any such insurance proceeds are actually realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the claims to which such insurance proceeds relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly regarding the amount of such indemnification payment.   

 (d) _Consequential; Punitive and Other Special Damages_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no party hereto shall be entitled to indemnification for consequential, punitive, indirect or special damages.   

 (e) _Damages Reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any Damages in respect of any liability or obligation accrued or reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet.    ##### 

  

  

 Section 12.5 Indemnification Amount. Claims for Damages pursuant to Section 12.2(a) shall be paid out of the Indemnification Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. All amounts paid with respect to Indemnification Claims under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties hereto for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Merger Consideration.   

 Section 12.6 Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Other than claims for actual fraud, following the Closing, indemnification pursuant to this Article XII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties and any parties claiming by or through any party (including the Indemnified Parties) for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement (other than any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in Article II hereof). The foregoing shall not affect the rights of Acquiror, the Company or its Subsidiaries to any equitable remedies available pursuant to Section 5.8.   

ARTICLE XIII. 
 MISCELLANEOUS    

 Section 13.1 Waiver.

Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.   

 Section 13.4 Rights of Third Parties. Except for (a) the provisions of Section 6.2, which is intended to be enforceable by the officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (b) the provisions of Section 6.4, which is intended to be enforceable by Relizon, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any Person, other than the parties hereto, any right or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.   

 Section 13.5 Expenses. Each party hereto, other than Holdings (whose expenses shall be paid out of funds paid to Holdings under Section 2.6 in the event the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated), shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions herein contemplated whether or not such transactions shall be consummated, including, without limitation, all fees of its legal counsel, financial advisers and accountants; _provided_ , _however_ , that    #####

each party hereto shall pay its own costs and expenses including, without

hereby are not consummated, the Company shall reimburse Holdings for all

 Section 13.6 Construction. This Agreement has been freely and fairly negotiated among the parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party because of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. Any reference to any law will be deemed also to refer to such law as amended and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The words "include," "includes," and "including" will be deemed to be followed by "without limitation." Pronouns in masculine, feminine, and neuter genders will be construed to include any other gender, and words in the singular form will be construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires. The words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereunder," and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular subdivision unless expressly so limited. The parties intend that each representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein will have independent significance.   

 Section 13.7 Captions; Counterparts. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.   

 Section 13.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Schedules and Annexes to this Agreement) and that certain Confidentiality Agreement dated as of June 8, 2004 between Acquiror and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") constitute the entire agreement among the parties and supersede any other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have been made or entered into by or among any of the parties hereto or any of their respective Subsidiaries relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. No representations, warranties, covenants, understandings, agreements, oral or otherwise, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement exist between the parties except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.   

 Section 13.9 Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the same manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement.   

 Section 13.10 Publicity. All press releases or other public communications of any nature whatsoever relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the method of the release for publication thereof, shall be subject to the prior mutual approval of Acquiror and the Company which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld by any party; _provided, however_ , that, nothing herein shall prevent Acquiror from publishing such press releases or other public communications as such party is required to make in order to satisfy such partys legal or contractual obligations after such consultation with the other parties hereto as is reasonable under the circumstances.   

 Section 13.11 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the laws governing this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent    ##### 

  

    

permitted by law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise
modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held
invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect
to the intent of the parties.   

 Section 13.12 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the choice of laws provisions thereof. Subject to Section 13.13, any proceeding or action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in the courts of Newcastle County in the State of Delaware, or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware located therein, and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such proceeding or action, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the proceeding or action shall be heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any proceeding or action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any other court.   

 Section 13.13 Mediation. In the event of a dispute between the parties that the parties are unable to resolve among themselves, the parties shall submit their dispute to non-binding mediation before a mutually agreeable mediator prior to initiating litigation. If the parties are unable to agree upon a mediator within thirty (30) days after failing to resolve the dispute, the American Arbitration Association shall be empowered to appoint a qualified mediator. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses of participating in the mediation (including without limitation, attorneys fees) and each party shall bear one-half (1/2) of the costs and expenses of the mediator. Unless otherwise agreed, the parties will hold mediation in the state of Delaware. The matters discussed or revealed in the mediation session shall not be revealed in any subsequent litigation. In the event the matter is not resolved in the mediation, either party may bring any actions available to them at law and in equity. Nothing in this Section 13.13 shall be deemed to limit a partys access to the court system to pursue a remedy which is limited to injunctive relief.   

 Section 13.14 Parent Guaranty. Parent hereby fully and unconditionally guarantees the full, complete and punctual performance by Acquiror and Merger Sub of all obligations and liabilities of Acquiror and Merger Sub under this Agreement and the Acquiror Transaction Documents (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "), irrespective of the enforceability of such obligations, the absence of any action to enforce the same or any circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of Parent as a guarantor of such obligations. If, for any reason whatsoever, Acquiror or Merger Sub shall fail or be unable to duly, punctually and fully pay or perform the Guaranteed Obligations, Parent will forthwith pay and cause to be paid in lawful currency of the United States, or perform or cause to be performed, the Guaranteed Obligations. Parent hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing objections with a court, any right to require proceeding first against Acquiror or Merger Sub, any right to require the prior disposition of the assets of Acquiror or Merger Sub to meet their respective obligations, notice, protest and all demands whatsoever. Parent, promptly after demand, shall reimburse Holdings or the Holder Representative for all costs and expenses of collecting such amounts or otherwise enforcing the guaranty set forth in this Section 13.14, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of counsel.
