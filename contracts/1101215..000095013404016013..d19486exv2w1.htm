<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;), dated as of October
8, 2004, is entered into by and among ADS ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS, INC., a
Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Acquiror</U>&#148;), EVEREST NIVOLE, INC., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror (&#147;<U>Merger Sub</U>&#148;), THE RELIZON e-CRM
COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;), RELIZON HOLDINGS, L.L.C., a
Delaware limited liability company (&#147;<U>Holdings</U>&#148;) and ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;), solely in its capacity as
guarantor of the obligations of Acquiror and Merger Sub pursuant to Section
13.14 hereof.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Parent, Acquiror, Merger Sub, Holdings and the Company (Merger Sub and
the Company sometimes being referred to herein as the &#147;<U>Constituent
Corporations</U>&#148;) are hereby adopting a plan of merger, providing for the merger
of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving
corporation. This merger (the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;) will be consummated in accordance with
this Agreement and evidenced by a Certificate of Merger between Merger Sub and
the Company in substantially the form of <U>Annex A</U> hereto (the &#147;<U>Certificate of
Merger</U>&#148;), such Merger to be consummated as of the Effective Time of the Merger
(as defined below).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and the Company, as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (hereinafter referred to for the periods on and after the Effective Time
of the Merger as the &#147;<U>Surviving Corporation</U>&#148;), shall continue its corporate
existence under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#147;<U>DGCL</U>&#148;) as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;On and after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Surviving
Corporation shall thereupon and thereafter possess all of the rights,
privileges, powers and franchises, of a public as well as a private nature, of
the Constituent Corporations, and shall become subject to all the restrictions,
disabilities and duties of each of the Constituent Corporations; and all
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of each Constituent Corporation, and
all property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due to each such
Constituent Corporation, on whatever account, and all chooses in action
belonging to each such corporation, shall become vested in the Surviving
Corporation; and all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and
all and every other interest shall become thereafter the property of the
Surviving Corporation as they are of the Constituent Corporations; and the
title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise or any other interest in
real estate vested by any instrument or otherwise in either of such Constituent
Corporations shall not revert or become in any way impaired by reason of the
Merger; but all Liens upon any property of either Constituent Corporation shall
thereafter attach to the Surviving Corporation and shall be enforceable against
it to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and duties had been
incurred or contracted by it; all of the foregoing in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the DGCL.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company
shall (i)&nbsp;transfer to The Relizon Company, a Delaware corporation (collectively
with its subsidiaries, &#147;<U>Relizon</U>&#148;), certain assets and liabilities relating to
the operation of the billing solutions business of the Company and its

Return shall be submitted promptly after such Tax Return has been prepared.
Acquiror shall timely file, or shall cause to be timely filed, all Pre-Closing

taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date (a

past practice and, on such Tax Returns, no position shall be taken, election

shall (i)&nbsp;in the case of any property or <I>ad valorem </I>Taxes, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Tax period, and (ii)&nbsp;in the case of any other Tax (including any income Taxes
or sales and use Taxes), be deemed equal to the amount which would by payable

Closing Date preceding the Closing. Accordingly, the &#147;next day rule&#148; provided
by Treasury Regulation &#167;1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) is inapplicable to the
Transactions. Without limitation of the foregoing, the transfer of the
Excluded Business as provided for in Section&nbsp;5.5 and the cashing out of the
unvested options as provided in Section&nbsp;2.1(a) are each properly allocable to
the portion of the Closing Date preceding the Closing, and all income and

business on the Closing Date. No election under Treasury Section&nbsp;Regulation.
&#167;1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) shall be made in connection with the Transactions.
Acquiror will not effect any transaction on the Closing Date (other than a
transaction required or expressly contemplated by this Agreement) that could
result in Tax liability to Holdings, the Company or its Subsidiaries in excess
of the Tax liability associated with the conduct of the Company&#146;s and its

its Subsidiaries (or any of their successors) for which Acquiror or its
Affiliates may be entitled to receive indemnity under this Agreement
(a &#147;<u>Tax

any other Person of any liability that it may have, except to the extent the
defense of such Tax Action is materially and irrevocably prejudiced by
Acquiror&#146;s failure to give such notice. Such notice shall include a copy of

Agreement (each, an &#147;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&#148;) against any Person obligated to
indemnify an Indemnified Party (an &#147;<U>Indemnitor</U>&#148;), then such Indemnified Party
will promptly give notice to the Indemnitor. Failure to notify the Indemnitor
will not relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to the
Indemnified Party, except to the extent the defense of such Action is
materially and irrevocably prejudiced by the Indemnified Party&#146;s failure to
give such notice. An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and thereafter
conduct the defense of any Action subject to any such Indemnification Claim
with counsel of the Indemnitor&#146;s choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party and to settle or compromise any such Action; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that the Indemnitor will not approve of the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to the Indemnification
Claim without the Indemnified Party&#146;s prior written approval (which must not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that it will not be deemed to be
unreasonable for an Indemnified Party to withhold its consent if such judgment
or settlement includes any finding of or admission of any violation of any law,
order or permit). Until an Indemnitor assumes the defense of the
Indemnification Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend against the
Indemnification Claim in any manner the Indemnified Party reasonably deems
appropriate. If the Indemnified Party gives an Indemnitor notice of an
Indemnification Claim and the Indemnitor does not, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days
after such notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume the defense of the Action or Actions subject to such
Indemnification Claim and thereafter promptly assumes such defense, then the
Indemnitor will be bound by any judicial determination made with respect to the
Action or Actions subject to such Indemnification Claim or any compromise or
settlement of the Action or Actions subject to such Indemnification Claim
effected by the Indemnified Party; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Indemnified
Party will not agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
or compromise with respect to the Action or Actions subject to any such
Indemnification Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). A claim for any matter not

the parties are unable to resolve among themselves, the parties shall submit
their dispute to non-binding mediation before a mutually agreeable mediator

the mediation (including without limitation, attorneys&#146; fees) and each party
shall bear one-half (1/2) of the costs and expenses of the mediator. Unless
otherwise agreed, the parties will hold mediation in the state of Delaware.
The matters discussed or revealed in the mediation session shall not be
revealed in any subsequent litigation. In the event the matter is not resolved
in the mediation, either party may bring any actions available to them at law

Sub of all obligations and liabilities of Acquiror and Merger Sub under this
Agreement and the Acquiror Transaction Documents (collectively, the &#147;<U>Guaranteed
Obligations</U>&#148;), irrespective of the enforceability of such obligations, the
absence of any action to enforce the same or any circumstances that might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of Parent as a
guarantor of such obligations. If, for any reason whatsoever, Acquiror or
Merger Sub shall fail or be unable to duly, punctually and fully pay or perform
the Guaranteed Obligations, Parent will forthwith pay and cause to be paid in
lawful currency of the United States, or perform or cause to be performed, the
Guaranteed Obligations. Parent hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of
payment, filing objections with a court, any right to require proceeding first
against Acquiror or Merger Sub, any right to require the prior disposition of
the assets of Acquiror or Merger Sub to meet their respective obligations,
notice, protest and all demands whatsoever. Parent, promptly after demand,
shall reimburse Holdings or the Holder Representative for all costs and
expenses of collecting such amounts or otherwise enforcing the guaranty set
forth in this Section&nbsp;13.14, including, without limitation, the fees and
expenses of counsel.
