applicable, to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the
REIT Per Share Merger Consideration or the Partnership Per Share Merger
Consideration, as applicable, as contemplated by this _Article 3_. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates, Unit
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the REIT Per Share Merger Consideration

Company Partnership Units are registered.

 

(h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of Company Common Stock or Company Partnership Units for twelve (12) months

creditors thereof) for payment of the REIT Merger Consideration or the
Partnership Surviving Entity (and only as general creditors thereof) for
payment of the Partnership Merger Consideration, as applicable.

(i) None of Parent, Company, the REIT Surviving Entity, the Partnership
Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director,
agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of the

effect, development, condition or occurrence (including the incurrence of any
liabilities of any nature, whether accrued or not, contingent or otherwise or
any assignment, transfer, license abandonment or other disposition of assets

Organizational Documents or other governing documents of any of the Company
Subsidiaries or Timbercreek Entities, or (b) any Existing Loan Document,
except in the case of (b) for defaults or violations which, individually or

Adverse Effect.

 

 _Section 4.11_ _Litigation_. Except as set forth on _Section 4.11_ of the

Action pending or, to the Knowledge of Company, threatened against Company,

any Company Subsidiary, nor any of the Company Properties, or, to the

 _Section 4.12_ _Taxes_.

 

(a) Each of Company, Company LP and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed
with the appropriate Governmental Authority all material Tax Returns required
to be filed, taking into account any extensions of time within which to file
such Tax Returns, and all such Tax Returns were true, complete and correct in
all material respects. Each of Company, Company LP and each
Company Subsidiary has duly paid (or there has been paid on their behalf),
all material Taxes required to be paid by them, whether or not shown on any
Tax Return. The most recent financial statements contained in the Company SEC
Documents filed prior to the date hereof reflect an adequate reserve
(excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) for all Taxes payable by the Company,
Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions
thereof through the date of such financial statements, and Taxes payable by
the Company, Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries on the Closing Date will
not exceed such reserve as adjusted through the Closing Date in
accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company, Company LP and
the Company Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns. None of the Company,
Company LP or any Company Subsidiary has any outstanding agreement, waiver or
other document or arrangement extending the period for assessment or
collection of material Taxes (including, but not limited to, any applicable
statute of limitation), and no power of attorney with respect to any material
Tax matter is currently in force with respect to the Company, Company LP or
any Company Subsidiary.

(b) Company (i) for all taxable years commencing with Companys year
ending December 31, 2006 and through December 31, 2014, has been subject to
taxation as a real estate investment trust within the meaning of Section 856
of the Code (a " _REIT_ ") and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a
REIT for such years; (ii) has operated since January 1, 2015, and will
continue to operate until the REIT Merger Effective Date, in a manner
consistent with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT;
and (iii) no challenge from a Governmental Authority is pending or, to the
Knowledge of Company, threatened with respect to the Companys status as a
REIT. None of the Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary has taken any
action or omitted to take any action which would reasonably be expected to
result in a successful challenge by the IRS to the Companys status as a REIT.
No Company Subsidiary is a corporation for United States federal income
tax purposes. _Section 4.12_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
true, correct and complete list identifying each Company Subsidiary that is a
partnership for Federal income tax purposes, a disregarded entity for Federal
income tax purposes, a "qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of
Section 856(i)(2) of the Code (each a " _QRS_ "), a corporation that qualifies
as a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856( _l_ ) of
the Code (each a " _Taxable REIT Subsidiary_ "), or any other entity treated
as a corporation for Federal income tax purposes. Companys dividends paid
deduction, within the meaning of Section 561 of the Code, for each taxable
year commencing with Companys year ending December 31, 2006 and through
December 31, 2014, taking into account any dividends subject to Sections
857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code, has not been less than the sum of (x) Companys
REIT taxable income, as defined in Section 857(b)(2) of the Code, determined
without regard to any dividends paid deduction for such year, and (y)
Companys net capital gain for such year.

 

(c) (i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority or
other proceedings pending with regard to any material Taxes or Tax Returns of
Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary; (ii) no material deficiency for
Taxes of Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary has been

 



28  claimed, proposed or assessed in writing by any Governmental Authority,
which deficiency has not yet been settled; (iii) neither Company, Company LP
nor any Company Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations with respect
to the assessment of material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to any material Tax assessment or deficiency for any open tax year;
(iv) except as set forth on _Section 4.12(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither Company, Company LP nor any Company Subsidiary currently is
the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any material Tax
Return; and (v) neither Company, Company LP nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has entered into any "closing agreement" as described in Section
7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign income Tax Law).

 

(d) Each Company Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company and that has not elected to be a Taxable REIT Subsidiary
has been since its formation treated for United States federal income tax
purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity, as the case may be, and not
as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation whose separate
existence is respected for federal income tax purposes.

(e) Neither Company, Company LP nor any Company Subsidiary holds any asset the
disposition of which would be subject to (or to rules similar to) Section
1374 of the Code (assuming for this purpose that the "recognition period," as
defined in Section 1374 of the Code, is in all cases 10 years) or the
"prohibited transactions" Tax under Section 857(b)(6), nor has it disposed of
any such asset during its current taxable year.

(f) For all taxable years commencing with Companys year ending December 31,
2006, Company, Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries have not incurred (i)
any material liability for Taxes under Sections 856(c), 857(b), 857(f), 860(c)
or 4981 of the Code or any rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code which
have not been previously paid, (ii) none of Company, Company LP or any Company
Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for Tax other than (A) in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, or (B) transfer or
similar Taxes arising in connection with sales of property. No event has
occurred, and no condition or circumstances exists, which presents a material
risk that any material liability for Taxes described in the preceding
sentence will be imposed upon Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary

(g) Company, Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries have complied, in all
material respects, with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and
withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections
1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 3402 and 1471 through 1474 of the Code or similar
provisions under any state and foreign Laws) and have duly and timely withheld
and, in each case, have paid over to the appropriate taxing authorities all
material amounts required to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the
due date thereof under all applicable Laws.

(h) Except as set forth in _Section 4.12(h)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there are no Company Tax Protection Agreements (as hereinafter

breach of any Company Tax Protection Agreements and the Company and the
Company LP have been and are in full compliance with the obligations under
such agreements except to the extent the obligations under such agreements
have been waived or terminated. Neither the Company nor Company LP owes any
amount under any Company Tax Protection Agreement. As used herein, " _Company
Tax Protection Agreements_ " means any written agreement to which Company,
Company LP or any Company Subsidiary is a party pursuant to which: (i) any
liability to holders of limited partnership interests in a Company Subsidiary
Partnership relating to Taxes may arise, whether or not as a result of the

Partnership, Company or the Company Subsidiaries have agreed to (A) maintain
a minimum level of debt, continue a particular debt or provide rights to
guarantee debt, (B) retain or not dispose of assets, (C) make or refrain from
making Tax elections, and/or (D) only dispose of assets in a particular
manner or requiring the payment of Tax indemnification or reimbursement. As
used herein, " _Company Subsidiary Partnership_ " means each of Company LP and
any other Company Subsidiary that is a partnership for United States federal
income tax purposes.

(i) There are no Tax Liens upon any property or assets of Company, Company LP
or any Company Subsidiary, except Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or
that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for
which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP.

 



29 (j) There are no Tax allocation or sharing agreements or similar arrangements
with respect to or involving Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary
(other than (A) any agreement or arrangement either solely between the Company
and any Company Subsidiary or solely between or among any two or more Company
Subsidiaries, (B) customary arrangements under commercial contracts or
borrowings entered into in the ordinary course of business, and (C) Company
Tax Protection Agreements), and after the Closing Date neither Company,

allocation or Tax sharing agreements, Tax Protection Agreements or similar
arrangements or have any liability thereunder for amounts due in respect of
periods prior to the Closing Date.

received or is subject to any written ruling of a Governmental Authority or
has entered into any written agreement with a Governmental Authority with
respect to any Taxes.

(l) Neither Company, Company LP nor any Company Subsidiary (i) has been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return
or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than any Company
Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract, or otherwise.

 

(m) Neither Company, Company LP nor any Company Subsidiary has participated in
any "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.6011-4(b).

(n) None of Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary has constituted
either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock
qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the
two (2) years prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution
which could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related
transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in
conjunction with transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Statement in preliminary form. Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to mail or deliver the Proxy Statement to its stockholders as promptly as

Affiliates and the holders of its capital stock to Company and provide such
other assistance as may be reasonably requested by Company in connection with

copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one hand,
and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the
Proxy Statement received from the SEC and advise Parent of any oral comments
with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC. Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or filing any other document to be filed by Company
with the SEC in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, Company shall cooperate and provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the
proposed final version of such document or response), and will include in such
documents or responses all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and to the
extent practicable, the Company will provide Parent with the opportunity to
participate in any substantive calls between the Company, or any of its
Representatives, and the SEC concerning the Proxy Statement.

 



50 (b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by Company or Parent which, in the reasonable
judgment of Company or Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, any of the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties hereto, and
Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the
extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to stockholders of Company. Nothing in this _Section
7.1(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any Party under _Section 7.1(a)_.

7.1(c)_, if, on a date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled,
Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Company shall have
the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Company Stockholder Meeting solely for the purpose of and for the times
reasonably necessary to solicit additional proxies and votes in favor of the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that the
Company Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is

_Section 7.2_ _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

contracts, and to the reasonable restrictions imposed from time to time upon
advice of counsel, Company and Company LP shall, and shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all
of their respective properties, offices, books, contracts, personnel and
records and, during such period, each of Company and Company LP shall, and
shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly
to the other Party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities Laws, and (ii) all other
information (financial or otherwise) concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request. No representation or warranty as
to the accuracy of information provided pursuant to this _Section 7.2(a)_ is
made and Parent may not rely on the accuracy of such information except to
the extent expressly set forth in the representations and warranties included
in Article 4, and no investigation under this _Section 7.2(a)_ or otherwise
shall affect any of the representations and warranties of Company or Company
LP contained in this Agreement or any condition to the obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Company
nor Company LP shall be required by this _Section 7.2(a)_ to provide Parent
or its Representatives with access to or to disclose information (A) that is
subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after the date of
this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice (if Company or Company LP has used reasonable best efforts to obtain
permission or consent of such third party to such disclosure), (B) the
disclosure of which would violate any Law applicable to Company, Company LP or
any of their

 



51  Representatives, or (C) that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney
work product or other legal privilege or would cause a risk of loss of
privilege to Company, Company LP or the Company Subsidiaries. Parent will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the
businesses of Company, Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries that may result
from the requests for access, data and information hereunder. Prior to the
REIT Merger Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall cause its respective
Representatives and Affiliates not to, contact or otherwise communicate with
parties with which Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary has a
business relationship (including property-level employees and
tenants/subtenants) regarding the business of Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
without the prior written consent of Company.

 

(b) Parent will hold, and will cause its Representatives and Affiliates to
hold, any nonpublic information, including any information exchanged pursuant
to this _Section 7.2_, in confidence to the extent required by and in
accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect
pursuant to the terms thereof notwithstanding the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the termination thereof.

_Section 7.3_ _No Solicitation; Company Acquisition Proposals_.

_Section 7.3(f)_, during the Interim Period, Company and Company LP shall
not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, and shall cause the
Representatives of Company, Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries not to,
(i) solicit, initiate, seek or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry,
proposal or offer with respect to, or the announcement, making or completion
of, any Company Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
is reasonably likely to lead to any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into, continue or otherwise participate or engage in any negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person other than Parent or its Representatives
any non-public information or data with respect to, any Company Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) approve, recommend, publicly declare advisable or enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, share exchange agreement,
consolidation agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement, in each case related to a Company
Acquisition Proposal (other than a Company Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement), or requiring or having the effect of requiring Company to abandon,
terminate or breach its obligations hereunder or fail to consummate the
Mergers (each, a " _Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (iv)
agree to or propose publicly to do any of the foregoing. Each of Company and
Company LP shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Representatives of
Company, Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries to, (A) immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing negotiations with any Person and its
Representatives (other than Parent or any of its Representatives) conducted
heretofore with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, (B) request the
prompt return or destruction, to the extent required by any confidentiality
agreement, of all confidential information previously furnished to any
such Person and its Representatives, and (C) not terminate, waive, amend,
release or modify any provision of any standstill agreement (including any
standstill provisions contained in any confidentiality or other agreement) to
which it or any of its Affiliates or Representatives is a party ( _provided_
, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
understood and agreed that each of Company and Company LP by execution of this
Agreement shall be deemed to have waived immediately prior to the date of
this Agreement any provision in any such agreement that prohibits the
counterparty thereto from confidentially requesting Company, Company LP or
such Company Subsidiary to amend or waive the standstill provision in such
agreement ( _i.e._ , a "dont ask, dont waive" provision) to the extent
necessary (and only to such extent) to enable such counterparty to convey
confidentially a Company Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board).

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 7.3(a)_ to the contrary, if, at any
time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, (1) Company or Company LP receives a written Company
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board believes in good faith to be bona
fide, (2) such Company Acquisition Proposal was not the result of a violation
of this _Section 7.3(a)_, and (3) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such
Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to,
a Company Superior Proposal, then Company and Company LP may (and may
authorize the Company Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to) (x)
furnish non-public information with respect to Company, Company LP and the
Company Subsidiaries to the Person making

 



52  such Company Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a
Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that any non-public
information provided to any Person given such access shall have previously
been provided to Parent or shall be provided (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) to Parent prior to or concurrently with the time it is
provided to such Person, and (y) participate in negotiations with the Person
making such Company Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons Representatives)
regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Company, Company LP and its Representatives may
contact any Person submitting a Company Acquisition Proposal (that was not the
result of a violation of this _Section 7.3(a)_) to clarify and understand the
terms of a Company Acquisition Proposal so as to determine whether
such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to
lead to, a Company Superior Proposal.

(c) Except as provided in  _Sections 7.3(d)_ , the Company Board (i)(A) shall
not fail to make and shall not withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner
adverse to Parent or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify in any
manner adverse to Parent) the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board of this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) shall not adopt, approve, or
publicly recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of
any Company Acquisition Proposal (each such action set forth in this _Section
7.3(c)(i)_ being referred to herein as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ "), and (ii) shall not cause or permit Company, Company LP or any of
the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any Company Alternative Acquisition
Agreement relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal (other than a Company
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.3(a))_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or cause or permit Company,
Company LP or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any Company
Alternative Acquisition Agreement relating to any Company Acquisition
Proposal, if. and only if (i) the Company has terminated (or promptly
following such Company Adverse Recommendation Change terminates) this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_ and concurrently therewith enters
into a Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (ii) the Company
Acquisition Proposal was not the result of, and was not facilitated by, a
violation of _Section 7.3(a)_, (iii) the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors and
taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be
offered by Parent pursuant to subsection (v) below) that such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and that the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent
with its duties under applicable Law, (iv) the Company has notified Parent in
writing that it intends to recommend that the stockholders of the Company
approve or accept such Company Superior Proposal, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or enter into an agreement related to the Company
Superior Proposal, attaching the most current version of such agreement
(including any amendments, supplements or modifications) to such notice (a "
_Change Notice_ "); (v) during the four Business Day period following Parents
receipt of a Change Notice, the Company shall have offered to negotiate with
(and, if accepted, negotiated in good faith with), and shall have caused its
respective financial and legal advisors to offer to negotiate with (and, if
accepted, negotiate in good faith with), Parent in making adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board determined to be a Company Superior Proposal ceases to be a
Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ _further_ that any
amendment, supplement or modification to any Company Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed a new Company Acquisition Proposal and the Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)_ or make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 7.3(d)_ unless the
Company has complied with the requirements of this _Section 7.3(d)_ with
respect to each such new Company Acquisition Proposal including sending a
Change Notice with respect to each such new Acquisition Proposal and offering
to negotiate for three Business Days from such new Change Notice; and (vi)
following the end of the four Business Day period or three Business Day period
(as applicable) contemplated by the immediately preceding sub-clause (v), the
Company Board determines, in good faith following consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Company Superior
Proposal giving rise to the Change Notice continues to constitute a Company
Superior Proposal (taking into account modifications or amendments to this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Change Notice).

 

(e) Company shall promptly (but in no event more than 24 hours following
receipt of such Company Acquisition Proposal) notify Parent if Company
determines to begin providing non-public information or to engage in
negotiations concerning a Company Acquisition Proposal pursuant to _Section
7.3(b)_ and shall in no

 



53  event begin providing such information or engaging in such discussions or
negotiations prior to providing such notice. Such notification shall include,
to the extent then known, the identity of the parties and a copy of such
Company Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request or, if not made in writing, a
written description thereof. The Company shall provide Parent with copies of
(to the extent in writing), and shall keep Parent apprised in all material
respects on a timely basis as to the status (including, within 24 hours after
the occurrence of any material amendment or modification) of, any such Company
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request, including by furnishing copies of
any documentation and written correspondence that supplements or amends any
such Company Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request in any material respect.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.3_ shall prohibit Company or the
Company Board through its Representatives, directly or indirectly, from
issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder or taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a),
or making a statement contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_
, that to the extent any such disclosure addresses the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board
with respect to this Agreement or a Company Acquisition Proposal, such
disclosure shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if
not accompanied by an express public re-affirmation of the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board of this
Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or
otherwise participating with respect to any Claim in advance of the final
disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to
the Indemnified Party of any Claim Expenses incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such
indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of
any bond or other security, but subject to (A) the Partnership Surviving
Entitys and the REIT Surviving Entitys receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it is
ultimately determined under applicable Laws or any of the Organizational
Documents that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified, and
(B) a good faith affirmation by such Indemnified Party of such Indemnified
Partys compliance with the standard of conduct required herein; _provided_ ,
that the Partnership Surviving Entity and the REIT Surviving Entity shall not
be liable for any amounts paid in settlement effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed) and shall not be obligated to pay the fees
and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the
applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction with respect to any single Claim except to the extent the
Indemnified Party is advised by counsel that such Indemnified Party has
conflicting interests with one or more other Indemnified Parties in the
outcome of such action (in which event such Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to engage separate counsel, the fees and expenses for which the
Surviving Entity shall be liable). The indemnification and advancement
obligations of the Partnership Surviving Entity and the REIT Surviving Entity
pursuant to this  _Section 7.5(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions
occurring at or before the Partnership Merger Effective Time and the REIT
Merger Effective Time, as applicable, and any Claim relating thereto
(including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the approval of this Agreement, the Mergers and the consummation of the other

approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any
Claim relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement
conferred hereunder shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of Company
or Company LP or any of the Company Subsidiaries after the date hereof and
shall inure to the benefit of such persons heirs, executors and personal and
legal representatives. As used in this _Section 7.5(a)_, (I) the term "
_Claim_ " means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed Action, suit or
proceeding or inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by any Party
hereto, any Governmental Authority 

 



55  or any other Person, that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might
lead to the institution of any Action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration
or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or
pertaining to (x) matters that relate to such Indemnified Partys duties or
service as a manager, director, officer, trustee, employee, agent or
fiduciary of Company, Company LP or, any of the Company Subsidiaries or, to
the extent such person is or was serving at the request or for the benefit of
Company, Company LP or any of the Company Subsidiaries, any other entity or
any Benefit Plan maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to the
Closing, and (y) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Mergers; and (II) the term " _Claim Expenses_ " means

connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in
or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant
to this _Section 7.5(a)_, including any Action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. The
Partnership Surviving Entity and the REIT Surviving Entity, as applicable,
shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
actual or threatened Claim in respect of which indemnification has been sought
by an Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise
or judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability arising out of such Claim, or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents thereto.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent, the Partnership Surviving
Entity and the REIT Surviving Entity agrees that all rights
to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing, now existing in favor of the current or
former managers, directors, officers, agents or fiduciaries of the Indemnified
Parties as provided in the Organizational Documents and indemnification
agreements of Company and Company LP shall survive the Mergers and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a period
of six (6) years from the Closing Date. For a period of six (6) years
following the Closing, the Organizational Documents of the Partnership
Surviving Entity, the REIT Surviving Entity and any applicable Company
Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to indemnification and limitations on liability of directors and officers
than are set forth in the Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years
following the Closing in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Closing, were directors,
officers, trustees, agents or fiduciaries of Company, Company LP or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, unless such modification shall be required by
applicable Law and then only to the minimum extent required by applicable Law.

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, as applicable, Parent,
the Partnership Surviving Entity or the REIT Surviving Entity shall maintain
in effect Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
covering each Person currently covered by Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to and
through the Closing; _provided_ , that in lieu of such obligation, (i) Parent,
the REIT Surviving Entity or the Partnership Surviving Entity, as applicable,
may substitute therefor policies of an insurance company with the same or
better rating as Companys and Company LPs current insurance carrier the
material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable
in any material respect to such directors and officers than Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) in consultation with Parent, Company
may obtain extended reporting period coverage under Companys, Company LPs
or the applicable Company Subsidiarys existing insurance programs (to be
effective as of the Closing) or purchase a "tail" policy for a period of six
(6) years after the Closing, as applicable, for a cost not in excess of three
times the current annual premiums for such insurance; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in no event shall the REIT Surviving Entity or the
Partnership Surviving Entity be required to pay annual premiums for insurance
under this _Section 7.5(c)_ in excess of 250% of the most recent annual
premiums paid by Company, Company LP or the applicable Company Subsidiary, as
applicable, prior to the date of this Agreement for such purpose, it being
understood that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the REIT Surviving Entity or the Partnership Surviving Entity, as
applicable, shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may
be obtained for such 250% amount.

(d) If Parent, the REIT Surviving Entity, the Partnership Surviving Entity or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
with or into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation, partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger, or
(ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the REIT Surviving Entity or the Partnership Surviving Entity, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
7.5_.

 



56 (e) Parent, the REIT Surviving Entity and the Partnership Surviving Entity
shall, pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations provided in this _Section 7.5_; _provided_ , that such
Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is
determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled to indemnification under
Law.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 7.5_ are intended to be for the express
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party (who are
intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.5_), his or her heirs
and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of Parent, Company, Company LP, the REIT Surviving Entity and the
Partnership Surviving Entity and shall not be amended in a manner that is
adverse to the Indemnified Party (including his or her successors, assigns and
heirs) without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (including
such successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby. The exculpation and
indemnification provided for by this _Section 7.5_ shall not be deemed to be
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, contract or otherwise.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,

to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by,
any Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) subject to _Section 7.7(c)_, the defending of any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Authority vacated or reversed, the avoidance of each and every impediment
under any antitrust, merger control, competition or trade regulation Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Mergers so
as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary or advisable
to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this

Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of
the Parties hereto shall and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
the other may request in connection with the preparation of any required
governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any
inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including promptly informing the other

Benefits set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above to each such officer in a

62 (e) _Section 7.18(e)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a

Agreement. Within sixty (60) days following the execution of this Agreement,
at the request of Parent, Seller will make available to Parent the Company
facilities and Company Employees for interview, on days and at times as
mutually agreed to by Parent and Seller, and, except for any information the
disclosure of which would violate any Laws, provide such information as Parent
may reasonably request for purposes of determining whether Parent desires to
retain a Company Employee as a continuing employee of Milestone Management,
LLC after the Mergers (any Company Employee employed by Milestone Management,
LLC immediately following the consummation of the Mergers is herein referred
to as a " _Continuing Employee_ "). Following the execution of this Agreement,
Company, Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries shall permit Parent to
disseminate information, at times and in a manner as mutually agreed to by
Parent and Seller, concerning Parent, Milestone Management, LLC and the
Affiliates of either. Other than the Company Employees and the independent

Disclosure Letter, no individual is employed by, or provides services to, any
of the Company, Company LP or the Company Subsidiaries. Within twenty (20)
days following the date of this Agreement, Company shall provide Parent in
writing a complete and accurate list of the following information for each of
the Company Employees, including each employee on leave of absence, and such
list shall be updated by the Company once per month: employing entity; name;
location of employment; job title; base salary; bonus/incentive potential and
the means of determining whether such bonus/incentive is achieved; status as
exempt or non-exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended;
details of any co-employment relationship; visa status (including sponsoring
entity and expiration date); health plan experience, which shall be provided
in an aggregated and de-identified form, rather than per employee, consistent
with HIPAA; vacation and other paid time off accrued; and, with respect to
each employee on an approved leave of absence, the nature of such leave and
date such employee is anticipated to return to active employment.

 

(f) Until December 31, 2016, Parent shall cause Milestone Management, LLC to
provide (i) each Continuing Employee while in the employ of Milestone
Management, LLC with at least the same salary or wage rate as in effect for
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) eligibility
for any incentive compensation or bonus plan of Milestone Management, LLC on
the same terms and subject to the same restrictions as applicable to similarly
situated employees of Milestone Management, LLC, and (iii) employee benefits
to each Continuing Employee while in the employ of Milestone Management, LLC
that are comparable in the aggregate to those employee benefits that are
generally made available to similarly situated employees of Milestone
Management, LLC.

 

(g) Parent shall cause each Continuing Employee to receive credit for such
Continuing Employees past service with Company, Company LP or the Company
Subsidiaries prior to Closing under the employee benefit and compensation
plans and policies of Parent, Milestone Management, LLC or an Affiliate of
either for the purpose of (A) eligibility and (B) vesting, provided that
no such prior service shall be taken into account to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Continuing
Employees shall not receive credit for such past service for the purposes of
benefit accruals under any compensatory arrangement of Parent and Milestone
Management, LLC or an Affiliate of either.

(h) Effective as of the Closing or, if later, the effective time of the
termination of the Health Plan, Parent shall (A) cause each Continuing
Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in a group health plan and any and all welfare plans made available to
similarly-situated employees as described _Section 7.18(f)_, and (B) cause
all preexisting condition exclusions in any plan providing medical, dental,
disability, life, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing
Employee to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents,
unless such conditions would not have been waived under the corresponding
benefit plan of Company, Company LP or the Company Subsidiaries in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the above, each Continuing Employee will be eligible to
participate in the Milestone Management, LLC Flexible Spending Plan effective
April 1, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the FSA Plan.

(i) Upon the termination of employment of (i) any Company Employee who does
not become a Continuing Employee in connection with the Mergers as a result
of Parents determination not to retain

 



63  such Company Employee following the Closing, and (ii) any Continuing
Employee, in each case Parent or one of its Affiliates shall pay out the
accrued vacation and paid time off of each such individual in the amounts set
forth in _Section 7.18(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and subject to an
acknowledgement by a Continuing Employee that the Continuing Employee has
received all benefits due under Companys accrued vacation and paid time off
policy; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in consideration of
Company agreeing to amend the Employment Agreements in accordance with
_Section 6.1(b)(x)(4)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, Stanley J. Olander,
Jr., Gustav G. Remppies and Greg Edward Brooks shall each agree to forfeit any
and all accrued vacation and paid time off to which he is otherwise entitled,
and, accordingly, shall not be entitled to a pay out of his accrued vacation
and paid time off. The value of the accrued vacation and paid time off of
Messrs. Olander, Remppies and Brooks, as set forth in _Section 7.18(i)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter may be used to pay a bonus, in a form and manner
determined by Company, to any Company Employee(s) to whom the Company will
also pay a bonus pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)(xiii)(C)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 

(j) Parent shall (or shall cause its Affiliates to) assume all obligations to
provide continued health coverage in accordance with Section 4980B of the
Code and Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA (" _COBRA_ ") to the Company
Employees (including the Continuing Employees) and their qualified
beneficiaries who elect COBRA coverage. Within thirty (30) days of the
execution of this Agreement, Company shall provide Parent with a list,
accurate as of the date of the creation of the list, of any and all employees
and/or beneficiaries who (A) are currently receiving continued medical
coverage under COBRA or (B) have yet to elect continuing medical coverage
under COBRA but are currently within the COBRA election period. Company shall
also provide Parent with notice of any changes to the COBRA coverage and/or
eligibility of any employee between the time of the original list
contemplated herein and the Closing Date.

(k) Parent shall take any and all reasonable action as may be required,
including, if necessary, amendments to the tax qualified defined contribution
plan of Parent or one of its Affiliates (the " _Parent Savings Plan_ "), to
permit each Continuing Employee to elect to make rollover contributions to
the Parent Savings Plan of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 402(c)(4) or Section 403(b)(8) of the Code, and as
permitted and limited by the Parent Savings Plan, as such plan may be amended
from time to time) in an amount equal to the entire eligible rollover
distribution portion of the account balance or annuity contract, as
applicable, distributable to such Continuing Employee from the 401(k) Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Continuing Employees eligible rollover
distribution may not contain any outstanding loans from the 401(k) Plan.
Continuing Employees who were participants in the 401(k) Plan will be provided
the opportunity to elect to participate in the Parent Savings Plan effective
as of the Closing Date and will be permitted to contribute to the Parent
Savings Plan as soon as administratively feasible following the Closing Date.

 

(l) At the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, pay
any and all stay on bonuses that become payable to Company Employees, in the
amounts and in accordance with the terms set forth in _Section 7.18(l)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter.

Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Payment of the Company
Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to the
account or accounts designated by Parent (x) at the earlier of execution of a
definitive agreement with respect to, submission to the stockholders of the
Company of, or the consummation of any transaction contemplated by, a Company
Acquisition Proposal, in the case of a Company Termination Fee payable
pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)(i)_, (y) as promptly as reasonably practicable
after termination (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days thereof),
in the case of a Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section
9.3(b)(ii)_, and (z) at the time of termination, in the case of a Company
Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)(iii)_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except in the case of fraud or
intentional and willful misconduct as expressly provided in  _Section 9.2_,
in the event that the Company Termination Fee becomes payable, then payment to
Parent of the Company Termination Fee, together with any amounts due under
_Section 9.3(d)_, shall be Parents sole and exclusive remedy as liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages of any nature against Company,
Company LP, the Company Subsidiaries and each of their respective former,
current and future directors, officers, employees, agents, general and
limited partners, managers, members, stockholders, Affiliates and assignees
and each former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general
or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder, Affiliate or assignee of any
of the foregoing in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in
connection herewith, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the termination of
this Agreement, the failure of the Mergers to be consummated or for a breach
or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such Company
Termination Fee no Company Party shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

(c) The Company agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent
pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(i_) (i.e., based upon inaccuracy of
representation of Company or breach of covenant by Company) under
circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is not payable pursuant to
_Section 9.3(b)(i)_, then the Company shall pay, within three Business Days
of the Termination Date, to Parent the Parent Expenses in immediately
available funds to an account directed by Parent, provided, that the payment
by the Company of the Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section 9.4(c)_ shall
not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_ (but in the event such Company
Termination Fee is or becomes payable, it shall be reduced on a dollar for
dollar basis for the Parent Expenses actually paid to Parent pursuant to this
_Section 9.4(c)_).

 

(d) Parent agrees that if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ or  _Section 9.1(d)(iii)_, then Parent shall pay to
the Company a termination fee of $50,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_
") within three (3) Business Days of the date of such termination by the
Company in immediately available funds to an account directed by the Company,
it being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the
Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(e) If Company is required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee or Parent
is required to pay Company the Parent Termination Fee (each, a " _Termination
Payment_ "), such Termination Payment shall be paid into escrow on the date
such payment is required to be paid by such party (" _Payor_ ") pursuant to
this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an escrow
account designated in accordance with this _Section 9.3(e)_. In the event
that a Payor is required to pay a Termination Payment, the amount payable to
the other party (such party, " _Payee_ ") in any tax year of Payee shall not
exceed the lesser of (i) the Termination Payment, and (ii) the sum of (A) the
maximum amount that can be paid to Payee or, with respect to the Company
Termination Fee, the aggregate amount that can be paid to each owner of
Parent, respectively, as if each were a separate party, without causing such
party to fail to meet the requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code for the relevant tax year, determined as if the payment of such amount
did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the
Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), and Payee (or such beneficial owner) has
income from unknown sources during such year in an amount equal to 1% of
its gross income which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case as determined
by Payees independent accountants, plus (B) in the event Payee receives
either (x) a letter from Payees counsel indicating that Payee has received a
ruling from the IRS as described in _Section 9.3(e)_ or (y) an opinion from
its outside counsel as described in _Section 9.3(e)_, an amount equal to the
excess of the Termination Payment less the amount payable under clause (A)
above.

 



69 (f) To secure Payors obligation to pay any amounts payable pursuant to 
_Section 9.3(e)_, Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to
the Termination Payment with an escrow agent selected by Payor on such terms
(subject to this _Section 9.3_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by
the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow
of the Termination Payment pursuant to this _Section 9.3(f)_ shall be made at
the time Payor is obligated to pay Payee such amount pursuant to _Section
9.3_ by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the
Termination Payment in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to
Payee unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the
following: (i) a letter from Payees independent accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Payee without causing
such party to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income and Payee has income from unknown sources during such year
in an amount equal to 1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying Income
(in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying
Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the
receiving party, or (ii) a letter from Payees outside counsel indicating that
(A) Payee received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by such
party of the Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or
would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code or (B) Payees outside counsel has rendered a
legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by such party of the Termination
Payment should either constitute Qualifying Income should be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in
which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Termination
Payment to Payee. Payor agrees to amend this _Section 9.3_ at the reasonable
request of Payee in order to (i) maximize the portion of the Termination
Payment that may be distributed to Payee hereunder without causing Payee to
fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (ii)
improve Payees chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this
_Section 9.3_ or (iii) assist Payee in obtaining a favorable legal opinion
from its outside counsel as described in this _Section 9.3_. Any amount of
the Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year
shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject
to the foregoing limitations of this _Section 9.3_, provided, however, that
the obligation of Payor to pay the unpaid portion of the Termination Payment
shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five (5) years
from the date of this Agreement. Any payment due to Company or Parent
described in this _Section 9.3_ shall be subject to the same limitations on
payment as set forth in this  _Section 9.3(f)_.

(g) Each of Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement. If Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due
pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Company for the amounts
set forth in _Section 9.3(b)_, Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in
_Sections 9.3(b)_ from the date of termination of this Agreement at a rate per
annum equal to the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made.

_Section 9.4_ _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Parties hereto by action
taken or authorized by the Company Board and Parent, respectively, at any time
before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time and the REIT Merger Effective Time;
provided, that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there
shall not be (a) any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or
the form of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the
holders of Company Common Stock or Company Partnership Units, or which by
applicable Law requires the further approval of the stockholders of Company
without such further approval of such stockholders, or (b) any amendment or
change not permitted under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the Parties.

 

 _Section 9.5_ _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes that
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement

 



70  (together with any related interests, penalties or additions to Tax, "
_Transfer Taxes_ "), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount
of Transfer Taxes. From and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time and
the REIT Merger Effective Time, each of the REIT Surviving Entity and the
Partnership Surviving Entity shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction
or withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to holders of
Company Common Stock or holders of Company Partnership Units, all Transfer
Taxes.

_Section 10.3_ _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any
present or future Law or public policy in any jurisdiction, as to that
jurisdiction, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable, (b)
this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party, and (d) such terms or
other provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced in any jurisdiction, the Parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

_Section 10.4_  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
together shall be deemed one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered (by telecopy, electronic delivery or otherwise) to the
other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile
transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document form" ("pdf"), or by
any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical
delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.

 

 _Section 10.5_ _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including the Exhibits, the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Parent Disclosure Letter), the Guarantee and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to and shall
not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, except for the provisions
of Article 3 (which, from and after the Partnership Merger Effective

 



72  Time and REIT Merger Effective Time, as applicable, shall be for the benefit
of holders of Company Partnership Units immediately prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time or the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, as applicable), _Section
3.7_, _Section 7.5_ (which, from and after the Partnership Merger Effective
Time and the REIT Merger Effective Time shall be for the benefit of the
Indemnified Parties) and _Section 7.18(a)_ (which, from and after the REIT
Merger Effective Time shall be for the benefit of officers of Company, Company
LP and the Company Subsidiaries set forth in  _Section 7.18(a)(i)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter). The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the
sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with _Section
10.6_ without notice or liability to any other Person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of
the Parties. Accordingly, persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations
of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of
any other date.

_Section 10.6_ _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time and the REIT Merger Effective Time, the Parties hereto
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other Parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other Party contained in this Agreement
or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a
Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any
Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

 

 _Section 10.7_ _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon,
arise out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland without giving effect to
its conflicts of laws principles (whether the State of Maryland or any other
jurisdiction that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Maryland).

 

 _Section 10.8_ _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each Party irrevocably agrees (a)
to submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Business and Technology
Case Management Program of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (the "
_Maryland Courts_ ") for the purpose of any Action (whether based on contract,
tort or otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
actions of the Parties in the negotiation, administration, performance and
enforcement of this Agreement, (b) that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (c) that it will not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of the parties
hereto in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of
this Agreement in any court other than the Maryland Courts, and (d) that a
final judgment in any Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

_Section 10.9_ _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties
without the prior written consent of the other Parties and any attempt to make
any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void , provided,
that any of Parent, REIT Merger Sub and Partnership Merger Sub may assign this
Agreement (i) to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or
(ii) after the REIT Merger Effective Time, to any Person; provided, however,
that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations
hereunder if the assignee does not perform its obligations. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

 

 _Section 10.10_ _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that Parent, REIT Merger Sub and Partnership Merger Sub shall be entitled to
seek an injunction or injunctions to

 



73  prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company and Company LP, in
addition to, and without any limitation of, any other remedy to which Parent,
REIT Merger Sub and Partnership Merger Sub are entitled at Law or in equity.
For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent, REIT Merger Sub and Partnership
Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with
this _Section 10.10_ and payment of monetary damages or the payment of the
Company Termination Fee, as applicable, under no circumstances shall Parent,
REIT Merger Sub and Partnership Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance requiring consummation of the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
such payment. Each of Company and Company LP further agrees not to assert that
a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide for an adequate remedy. Each of Company and Company LP hereby
waives (i) any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the
defense that a remedy at Law would be adequate, and (ii) any requirement
under Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief. The parties hereto agree that neither Company nor Company LP
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by Parent, REIT Merger Sub or Partnership Merger Sub or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement or the Equity
Commitment Letter and that Companys and Company LPs sole and exclusive
remedy relating to a breach of the Agreement by Parent, REIT Merger Sub or
Partnership Merger Sub or otherwise shall be the remedy set forth in _Section
9.3(d)_; _provided_ , however, that the Company shall be entitled to seek
specific performance to prevent any breach by Parent, REIT Merger Sub or
Partnership Merger Sub of _Section 7.2(b)_.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum
aggregate liability of Parent, REIT Merger Sub and Partnership Merger Sub
together for any losses, damages, costs or expenses of Company or Company LP
relating to the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
be consummated, or a breach of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub or Merger
Partnership or otherwise, shall be limited to an amount equal to (i) the
amount of the Parent Termination Fee, plus (ii) Parents indemnification and
reimbursement obligations pursuant to the third sentence of _Section
7.15(a)_, and the next-to-last sentence of _Section 2.8_ (collectively, the "
_Liability Limitation_ "), and in no event shall the Company or any of its
controlled Affiliates seek any amount in excess of the Liability Limitation in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise. Each
of Company and Company LP agrees that it has no right of recovery against,
and no personal liability shall attach to, any of the Parent Parties (other
than Parent, REIT Merger Sub or Partnership Merger Sub to the extent provided
in this Agreement), through Parent, REIT Merger Sub or Partnership Merger Sub
or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate,
limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim
by or on behalf of Parent, REIT Merger Sub or Partnership Merger Sub
against any Parent Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any
legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise, except for its rights to recover from the
Guarantor (but not any other Parent Party) under and to the extent provided
in the Guarantee and subject to the Liability Limitation and the other
limitations described therein. Recourse against the Guarantor under the
Guarantee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Company, Company LP and
their respective Affiliates against the Guarantor and any other Parent Party
(other than Parent, REIT Merger Sub or Partnership Merger Sub to the extent
provided in this Agreement) in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document or
theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Without limiting the rights of
Company or Company LP against Parent, REIT Merger Sub or Partnership Merger
Sub hereunder, in no event shall Company or its controlled Affiliates seek to
enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement
against, or seek to recover damages from, any Parent Party (other than the
Guarantor to the extent provided in the Guarantee and subject to the Liability
Limitation and the other limitations described therein).

 

 _Section 10.11_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE
OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN

 



74  INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.11_.

 

 _Section 10.12_ _Authorship_. The Parties agree that the terms and language
of this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and
their respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that
any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any Party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation.

_[Signature Page Follows]_

 



75 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed and
delivered by their respective duly authorized officers, all as of the date
first written above.
