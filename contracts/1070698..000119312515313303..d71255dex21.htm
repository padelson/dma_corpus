as and when due, (i) the SellerÂ’s ongoing obligations under the Transferred
Contracts identified on _Schedule 1.4(a)_ and (ii) the SellerÂ’s ongoing
obligations under (A) Section 3.3(a) of the Reversionary Letter Agreement as
modified by Section 4.1 of the Reversionary Asset Transfer Agreement and (B)
Section 4.1 of the Reversionary Asset Transfer Agreement (the obligations
described in this clause "(ii)," the " _Reversionary Net Sales Obligations_
"), but only, in the case of each of clauses "(i)" and "(ii)," to the extent
that such obligations: (A) arise after the Closing; (B) do not arise from or
relate to any breach by the Seller, any Affiliate of the Seller, the SRC or
any Seller Predecessor of any provision of any of such Transferred Contracts;
(C) do not arise from or relate to any event, circumstance or condition
occurring or existing on or prior to the Closing that, with or without notice
or lapse of time, could constitute or result in a breach of any of such
Transferred Contracts; and (D) are ascertainable (in nature and amount) solely
by reference to the express terms of such Transferred Contracts; _provided,
however,_ that in no event shall the Purchaser assume or be deemed to assume
any Liability arising under any Transferred Contract that accrued or arose
prior to the Closing. The obligations required to be assumed by the Purchaser
under this Section 1.4(a) are referred to in this Agreement as the " _Assumed
Obligations_."

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 1.4(a), if
the assignment of any of the SellerÂ’s rights, or the delegation of any of the
SellerÂ’s obligations, under any Transferred Contract identified on _Schedule
1.4(a)_ requires one or more Consents from any Person, and any such Consent
has not been obtained prior to the Closing, then: (i) such Transferred
Contract shall be treated as a Specified Asset under Section 11.1; and (ii)
the Purchaser shall not be obligated to, and shall not be deemed to, assume,
discharge or perform any Liability under such Transferred Contract at or after
the Closing; _provided, however,_ that if, after the Closing, all such
Consents with respect to such Transferred Contract are obtained in accordance
with Section 11.1, the Purchaser shall assume, and agree to discharge and
perform as and when due, all of the obligations under such Transferred
Contract that would have constituted Assumed Obligations at the Closing had
all such Consents been obtained prior to the Closing, but only to the extent
such obligations accrue and arise after the obtaining of all such Consents.

(c) Except as specifically provided in Sections 1.4(a) and 1.4(b), the
Purchaser shall not assume and shall not have any responsibility for paying,
discharging or otherwise performing, and the Assumed Obligations shall not
include, any Liability of the Seller, any Affiliate of the Seller or any
Seller Predecessor. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Purchaser shall not assume, and the Assumed Obligations shall not include: (i)
any Liability arising out of or resulting from the breach of any Contract
(including any Transferred Contract) by the Seller, any Affiliate of the
Seller or any Seller Predecessor, or any violation of any Legal Requirement by
the Seller, any Affiliate of the Seller or any Seller Predecessor; (ii) any
Liability of the Seller to any member or Affiliate of the Seller or to any
Seller Predecessor; (iii) any Liability of the Seller for any legal fees,
financial advisory fees or expenses relating to any of the Contemplated
Transactions or otherwise; (iv) any of the Liabilities set forth on _Schedule
1.4(c)_ ; or (v) any other Liability of the Seller, any Affiliate of the

1.5 Issuances of Purchaser Common Stock.

 

(a) _Share Issuance Elections_. The Purchaser may elect to issue shares of
Purchaser Common Stock in lieu of paying cash to satisfy its obligations to
pay (i) up to $34,175,000 of the Aggregate Closing Payment Amount, (ii) up to
50% of any Milestone Payment (or portion thereof) otherwise payable (or
prepayable) by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any
Regulatory Milestone Event, and/or (iii) up to 50% of the Milestone Payment
(or any portion thereof) payable (or prepayable) by the Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to the Trial Milestone Event (such an election, a
" _Purchaser Share Issuance Election_ "). The amount of cash that the
Purchaser would otherwise be required to pay in satisfaction of any payment
obligation pursuant to this Agreement with respect to which a Purchaser Share
Issuance Election has been made shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
product obtained by multiplying: (i) the aggregate number of whole shares of
Purchaser Common Stock issued in satisfaction of such payment obligation; _by_
(ii) the applicable Volume-Weighted Average Price. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall not make any
Purchaser Share Issuance Election that would require, pursuant to Nasdaq
Listing Rules or otherwise, a vote of the PurchaserÂ’s stockholders in order
to approve the issuance of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to such Purchaser Share Issuance Election.

 

(b) _Notice of Share Issuance Elections_. The Purchaser shall make a Purchaser
Share Issuance Election by delivering written notice thereof (which notice
shall set forth the portion of any cash amount otherwise payable by the
Purchaser that the Purchaser is electing to satisfy by issuing shares of
Purchaser Common Stock) as follows: (i) if the Purchaser Share Issuance
Election is made prior to the Closing Date with respect to the payment of the
Aggregate Closing Payment Amount, then such notice shall be given to the
Seller at least 10 days prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) if the Purchaser
Share Issuance Election is made after the Closing Date with respect to any
Regulatory Milestone Event or the Trial Milestone Event, then such notice
shall be given to the Seller at least 10 days prior to the applicable Share
Issuance Closing Date. Each Purchaser Share Issuance Election shall be
revocable by the Purchaser at any time prior to the applicable Share Issuance
Closing Date.

 

(c) _Issuances and Distributions of Purchaser Common Stock_. All shares of
Purchaser Common Stock to be issued on a Share Issuance Closing Date shall
initially be issued by the Purchaser delivering to the Seller two stock
certificates in the name of the Seller, one of which shall be legended in
accordance with Sections 1.5(d) and 1.5(f)(ii) and represent the Lock-Up
Shares issued on such date, and the other of which shall be legended in
accordance with Section 1.5(f)(ii) and represent the shares issued on such
date that are not subject to the Lock-Up. The Stock Recipient Members shall be
the only record or beneficial holders of membership interests of the Seller
to whom the Seller may distribute or otherwise transfer any such shares of
Purchaser Common Stock. Each time the Seller proposes to distribute or
otherwise transfer any shares of Purchaser Common Stock to any Stock
Recipient Member, the Seller shall, at least five days prior to the applicable
Share Issuance Closing Date, provide written notice thereof to the Purchaser,
together with such representations and instructions as may reasonably be
requested by the Purchaser in connection with such distribution. As promptly
as reasonably practicable following receipt of such representations and
instructions, the Purchaser shall instruct its transfer agent to register such
shares of Purchaser Common Stock in the names of the Stock Recipient Members
in accordance with such instructions, and the Purchaser shall deliver to each
such Stock Recipient Member: (i) if any of such shares are Lock-Up Shares, a
stock certificate in the name of such Stock Recipient Member, legended in
accordance with Sections 1.5(d) and 1.5(f)(ii), representing such Lock-Up
Shares and (ii) with respect to any such shares that are not subject to the
Lock-Up, a stock certificate in the name of such Stock Recipient Member
representing such shares, which certificate shall

 be legended in accordance with Section 1.5(f)(ii). For purposes of clarity,
if any shares of Purchaser Common Stock are issued to the Seller pursuant to
this Agreement, and the Seller does not distribute such shares to the Stock
Recipient Members in accordance with this Section 1.5(c), then the Seller may
hold such shares for its own account or, subject to Section 1.5(f), resell
such shares; _provided, however,_ that such shares of Purchaser Common Stock
may not be subsequently distributed or otherwise transferred by the Seller to
the Stock Recipient Members without the PurchaserÂ’s prior written consent.

 

(d) _Lock-Up_. Fifty percent of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be
issued to the Seller on any Share Issuance Closing Date shall be represented
on a stock certificate that shall bear a restrictive legend to the effect that
such shares may not be sold or otherwise disposed of, in whole or in part,
until the date that is 45 days after the applicable Share Issuance
Closing Date (such restriction on sale and transfer, the " _Lock-Up_ ," such
legend, the " _Lock-Up Legend_ " and the shares subject to the Lock-Up, the "
_Lock-Up Shares_ "). As promptly as reasonably practicable following written
notice from the Seller that the Seller wishes to distribute or otherwise
transfer any Lock-Up Shares to the Stock Recipient Members, and subject to the
SellerÂ’s compliance with Section 1.5(c) in respect of such distribution, the
Purchaser shall waive the Lock-Up to the extent necessary to permit the Lock-
Up Shares to be distributed or otherwise transferred to the Stock Recipient
Members; _provided, however,_ that, notwithstanding any such distribution,
the Lock-Up Shares shall continue to be subject to the Lock-Up and the stock
certificates representing the Lock-Up Shares shall continue to bear the Lock-
Up Legend, in each case, until the expiration of the Lock-Up in accordance
with its terms. Following expiration of the Lock-Up, upon the SellerÂ’s or any
applicable Stock Recipient MemberÂ’s written request, the Purchaser shall cause
the Lock-Up Legend to be removed as promptly as reasonably practicable in
accordance with the PurchaserÂ’s customary procedures for the removal of
legends.

(e) _Purchaser Share Issuance Closings_.

 

(i) If the Purchaser makes a Purchaser Share Issuance Election (that has not
been revoked) with respect to any cash amount otherwise payable to the Seller
pursuant to the provisions set forth above in this Section 1.5, then, on the
applicable Share Issuance Closing Date, the Purchaser shall deliver
irrevocable instructions to its transfer agent to issue to the Seller a
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole
share) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing: (A) the portion of the cash
payment obligation that the Purchaser has elected to satisfy with
Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to the Purchaser Share Issuance Election;
_by_ (B) the applicable Volume-Weighted Average Price. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in no event shall any
shares of Purchaser Common Stock be contributed to the Indemnification Escrow
Fund or shall the Indemnification Escrow Amount be reduced to reflect any
issuances of Purchaser Common Stock.

 

(ii) Without limiting any obligations of the Purchaser or the Seller under
Section 6.5(b), the Seller acknowledges that the shares of Purchaser Common
Stock issued in connection with this Agreement will not be registered under
the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder
for transactions not involving a public offering.

 

(f) _Distributions and Transfers of Purchaser Common Stock_.

 

(i) The Seller shall not, under any circumstance, distribute, transfer,
dividend or convey any shares of Purchaser Common Stock to any Person
(including any Seller Member) who is not a Stock Recipient Member.

(ii) All shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions will be evidenced by stock certificates delivered by
the Purchaser.

 Any such certificate representing Purchaser Common Stock that has not been
registered under the Securities Act shall be imprinted with the following
legend (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the Seller shall (and
shall cause its current and future Representatives and the Stock Recipient
Members to) comply with the terms thereof:

 

"THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, IN
WHOLE OR IN PART, OTHER THAN PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT OR IN
CONFORMITY WITH THE LIMITATIONS OF RULE 144 OR ANOTHER EXEMPTION AS THEN IN
EFFECT, WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING, IF REASONABLY REQUIRED BY THE COMPANY, (I) A
WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, WHICH MAY BE COUNSEL
TO THE COMPANY, TO THE EFFECT THAT THE CONTEMPLATED SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION
WILL NOT BE IN VIOLATION OF THE ACT, OR (II) A Â‘NO-ACTIONÂ’ OR INTERPRETIVE
LETTER FROM THE STAFF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO THE EFFECT
THAT SUCH STAFF WILL TAKE NO ACTION IN RESPECT OF THE CONTEMPLATED SALE OR
OTHER DISPOSITION."

 

In connection with any resale of such shares of Purchaser Common Stock that is
made by the Seller or any Stock Recipient Member in compliance with this
Agreement and with the Securities Act, the Seller or such Stock Recipient
Member, as applicable, shall request the Purchaser to, and the Purchaser
shall, cause such legend to be removed as promptly as reasonably practicable
in accordance with the PurchaserÂ’s customary procedures for the removal of
legends.

1.6 Transaction Taxes. The Seller shall be liable for and shall promptly pay
any and all sales Taxes, transfer Taxes or similar Taxes imposed on the Seller
by any Governmental Body or applicable Legal Requirement in connection with
any of the Contemplated Transactions. The Purchaser shall be liable for and
shall promptly pay any and all sales Taxes, transfer Taxes or similar Taxes
imposed on the Purchaser by any Governmental Body or applicable Legal
Requirement in connection with any of the Contemplated Transactions.

 

1.7 Allocation. The consideration payable for the Transferred Assets shall be
allocated in accordance with _Schedule 1.7_ and all applicable Legal
Requirements. Upon any adjustment to such consideration (including by reason
of any payments made under Section 2 or Section 10), the Purchaser shall
revise _Schedule 1.7_ (as it may be amended) to reflect such adjustment.
After the Closing, the Parties shall make consistent use of the allocation,
fair market values and useful lives specified in _Schedule 1.7_ for all Tax
purposes and all filings with all applicable Tax authorities with respect to
the Contemplated Transactions except to the extent otherwise required by the
Code or any provision of any state, local or foreign Tax law or under any
other applicable Legal Requirements.

 

1.8 Tax Withholding. The Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the
Purchaser determines in good faith are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom or in connection therewith under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement,
and any such amounts that have been deducted or withheld shall be paid over
by the Purchaser to the applicable Governmental

 Body. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over
to the applicable Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid. The Purchaser shall have no
responsibility or Liability for any decision by the Seller to deduct and
withhold any amounts from any amount otherwise payable to or by the Seller or
any other Person. Within a reasonable time after the Purchaser withholds and
deducts any amounts pursuant to this Section 1.8, the Purchaser shall provide
the Seller with notice of the amounts so withheld and deducted.

 

1.9 Closing. The consummation of the Asset Purchase Transaction and the other
transactions that are to be consummated contemporaneously therewith (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place electronically by exchange of .PDF copies of
documents on a date to be designated by the Purchaser, which shall be no later
than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to
be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Sections 7 and 8 (other
than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied by delivering
a document at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions) or at such other time, date and place, or in such other
manner, as the Parties may jointly designate. The date on which the Closing
actually takes place is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing
Date_."

First Commercial Sale of Aeroquin in the European Union under a label approved

Event 2_ ")

 |  | $ | [*** | ] 
   | 
  

First Commercial Sale of Aeroquin in the United States under a label approved
by the FDA for an indication other than (A) the treatment of infections in
patients with cystic fibrosis and (B) the treatment of diseases for which
Sales Milestone Event 1 was achieved (payable whether or not there has been
Regulatory Approval of Aeroquin for the CF Indication) (" _Sales Milestone

Sales Milestone Event 2 was achieved (payable whether or not there has been
Regulatory Approval of Aeroquin for the CF Indication) (" _Sales Milestone
Event 4_ ")

 |  | $ | [*** | ] 
 

For purposes of the foregoing, an indication for treatment of non-tuberculosis
mycobacterium infection and an indication for treatment of bronchiectasis not
limited to patients with cystic fibrosis shall each be considered an
indication other than treatment of infections in patients with cystic
fibrosis. For purposes of clarity, the Parties acknowledge that
Regulatory Milestone Event 1a, Regulatory Milestone Event 1b and Regulatory
Milestone Event 1c (the " _Regulatory Milestone Events_ ") are mutually
exclusive alternatives, and that a maximum of one Milestone Payment may become
payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of all Regulatory Milestone
Events. Once a Milestone Payment has been paid by the Purchaser to the Seller
in connection with the FDAÂ’s Regulatory Approval of Aeroquin for the CF
Indication, no further Milestone Payments (or portions thereof) shall be made
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the achievement of any Regulatory
Milestone Event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the aggregate Milestone Payment corresponding to the Trial
Milestone Event is, and each of the aggregate Milestone Payments corresponding
to the Milestone Events identified under the heading "Sales Milestones Events"
in the Milestone Table is, payable one time only, regardless of the number of
forms or presentations of Aeroquin that satisfy the condition for a particular
indication.

(i) The Acquiring Party shall be required to make a prepayment in an amount
equal to $[***], which shall be applied to the Milestone Payment
corresponding to the Regulatory Milestone Event (if any) that is ultimately
achieved, under the circumstances described below:

 

(A) If (1) there is a Change of Control prior to the FDA Response Time, (2)
there is an Expenditure Shortfall in any of the first three consecutive

any Milestone Payment (or prepayment of any Milestone Payment) made in respect

event the Change of Control was a transaction described in clause "(a)" of the
definition of Change of Control) shall be required to make a prepayment in an
amount equal to $[***], which shall be applied to the Milestone Payment
corresponding to the Regulatory Milestone Event that is ultimately achieved.

 

(B) If (1) there is a Change of Control prior to the earlier of the FDA
Response Time or [***], (2) Regulatory Approval of Aeroquin by the FDA for
the CF Indication is not obtained by [***], due exclusively to causes that are
unrelated to (w) any clinical data readout, (x) any Technical Failure, (y) any
action or inaction by a third party that was not reasonably foreseen by the
Purchaser or was not within the PurchaserÂ’s control (it being understood that
a contractual relationship between the Purchaser and a third party will not,
by itself, be deemed to put the Purchaser in "control" of such third party or
such third partyÂ’s actions or inactions) or (z) any action or inaction by a
Regulatory Authority, (3) no Regulatory Milestone Event shall have been
achieved, (4) there shall not have been any Technical Failure or [***], (5)
none of the events or circumstances referred to in Section 2.4(a)(iii)(C),

amount equal to $[***], which shall be applied to the Milestone Payment
corresponding to the Regulatory Milestone Event that is ultimately achieved.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 2.1(b)(i)

required to be made pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(i), and any such
prepayment that is made shall be counted as a prepayment against any
Regulatory Milestone Event that is ultimately achieved. Thus, for example, if
a prepayment of $[***] is made pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(i)(B), and
Regulatory Milestone Event 1c is subsequently achieved, then the amount
payable under this Agreement on account of the achievement of Regulatory
Milestone Event 1c shall be $[***].

 

(ii) If (A) there is a Change of Control prior to the time of the First Dose
in a Registrational Trial of Aeroquin for the Second Indication, (B) there is
an Expenditure Shortfall in any of the first three consecutive periods of 12

such Registrational Trial) or Section 2.4(f)(iii) shall have occurred or
exist and (F) there shall not have been any prepayment made pursuant to this
Section 2.1(b)(ii) or Section 2.1(b)(iii), then, within 30 days after the end

the event the Change of Control was a transaction described in clause "(a)" of
the definition of Change of Control) shall be required to make a prepayment in
an amount equal to $[***], which shall be applied to the Milestone Payment
corresponding to the Trial Milestone Event.

Control, with the first such 12 calendar month period commencing on the first
day of the first full calendar month following such Change of Control, (C)
Sales Milestone Event 1 shall not have been achieved, (D) there shall not
have been any Technical Failure, (E) none of the events or circumstances
referred to in Section 2.4(c)(ii) or Section 2.4(f)(iii) shall have occurred

Section 2.1(b)(iii), then, within 30 days after the end of the Applicable
12-Month Period, the Acquiring Party (or the Purchaser, in the event the
Change of Control was a transaction described in clause "(a)" of the
definition of Change of Control) shall be required to make a prepayment in an

prepayments required to be made pursuant to this Section 2.1(b) exceed $[***]
in the aggregate; (y) if any Milestone Payment that was partially prepaid
pursuant to this Section 2.1(b) becomes payable in full based on achievement
of the corresponding Milestone Event, the portion of such Milestone Payment
required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced by the
portion of such Milestone Payment that was prepaid pursuant to this Section
2.1(b); and (z) no prepayment of all or any portion of any Milestone Payment
shall be required to be made under this Section 2.1(b) if: (I) in the case of
the Milestone Payment corresponding to the Regulatory Milestone Events, the
Purchaser is excused from filing, or is otherwise no longer required to file,
the NDA; or (II) in the case of the Milestone Payment corresponding to the
Trial Milestone Event or Sales Milestone Event 1, the Purchaser is excused
from expending, or is otherwise no longer required to expend, any efforts
relating to the potential achievement of the applicable Milestone Event.

(c) _Steering Committee_.

 

(i) _Establishment_. Promptly after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
establish a steering committee composed of two or more members appointed by
the Purchaser and one member (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Purchaser) appointed by the Seller (the " _Steering Committee_ "). The
Steering CommitteeÂ’s function will be to serve in a non-binding advisory role
with respect to the activities of the Purchaser under this Agreement in the
preparation of the NDA for Aeroquin for the CF Indication. The Steering
Committee shall cease its activities and shall be disbanded upon the earliest
of: [***].

(ii) _Membership_. The SellerÂ’s initial appointee to the Steering
Committee shall be the individual identified on _Schedule 2.1(c)(ii)_. If, at
any time, the SellerÂ’s initial appointee to the Steering Committee resigns or
otherwise needs to be replaced, the Seller shall nominate a new appointee to
the Steering Committee, who must be satisfactory to the Purchaser. Any
replacement appointee to the Steering Committee nominated by the Seller: (A)
shall be a natural person with sufficient experience and seniority to provide
useful advice on issues within the scope of the activities of the Steering
Committee; (B) shall not be the subject of a pending or threatened action that
could result in, and shall not have ever suffered or been subject to, any
suspension, disbarment, exclusion, censure, reprimand or other adverse action
by any academic, government, medical or professional board, body or
organization; (C) shall have never held or run for any federal, state, local
or foreign political office; and (D) shall not have, and shall not have ever
had, an actual or perceived conflict of interest with respect to the
preparation of the NDA for Aeroquin, with respect to the Seller, with respect
to any member of the Seller or with respect to the Purchaser. If such
a replacement is necessary, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser with
background information regarding the requested appointee (including the
requested appointeeÂ’s job title and a brief summary of any relevant business
experience of the requested appointee). The Purchaser will notify the Seller
as to whether the SellerÂ’s requested appointee is satisfactory to the
Purchaser within 10 days after the Purchaser receives the background
information on the requested appointee. All of the individuals identified on
_Schedule 2.1(c)(ii)_ shall be deemed satisfactory to the Purchaser.

(iii)  _Meetings_. The Steering Committee will hold meetings at such times as
may be determined by the Purchaser, but no less than twice per full calendar
year. Such meetings may be conducted by videoconference, teleconference or in
person, as determined by the Purchaser.

(iv) _Observer Right_. To the extent practical, the SellerÂ’s appointee on the
Steering Committee shall be permitted to observe any prescheduled, in-person
meetings, and any

 prescheduled telephone conference calls, between representatives of the
Purchaser and representatives of the FDA, to the extent such prescheduled
meetings and calls relate to the NDA for Aeroquin for the CF Indication.

(d) _Milestone Payments_. Subject to Section 10, within 30 days after the
achievement of a Milestone Event in respect of which a payment is required to
be made under this Agreement, the Purchaser shall cause to be paid to the
Seller the Milestone Payment corresponding to such Milestone Event in the
Milestone Table.

 

2.2 Revenue-Based Contingent Payments.

 

(a) _Calculation of Revenue-Based Contingent Payments_. For each calendar year
following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall make contingent payments to
the Seller in accordance with this Section 2.2(a) in an aggregate amount equal
to (i) the First Sales Increment _multiplied by_ [***]%, _plus_ (ii) the
Second Sales Increment _multiplied by_ [***]%, _plus_ (iii) the Third Sales
Increment _multiplied by_ [***]%.

Annual Net Sales (calendar year)

 |  | Applicable 
Percentage | 
    

For that portion of Annual Net Sales in such calendar year less than or equal
to $[***] (such portion of Annual Net Sales in a particular calendar year,
the " _First Sales Increment_ " with respect to such calendar year)

 |  |  | [*** | ]% 
   | 
  

For that portion of Annual Net Sales in such calendar year greater than $[***]
but less than or equal to $[***] (such portion of Annual Net Sales in a

such calendar year)

For that portion of Annual Net Sales in such calendar year greater than $[***]
(such portion of Annual Net Sales in a particular calendar year, the " _Third
Sales Increment_ " with respect to such calendar year)

 |  |  | [*** | ]% 
 

Each percentage set forth in the table above is an incremental rate which
applies only to the corresponding increment of Net Sales described in the
"Annual Net Sales" column and, thus, once a total amount of "Annual Net Sales"
is achieved for the applicable calendar year or in any applicable calendar
quarter, the amounts owed on any lower tier portion of Net Sales will not be
adjusted up to any higher tier rate. The payments required to be made pursuant
to this Section 2.2(a) are referred to as " _Revenue-Based Contingent
Payments_."

(b) _Payment of Revenue-Based Contingent Payments_. Within 60 days after
the completion of each full calendar quarter following the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall provide a written report to the Seller setting forth, in
reasonable detail: (A) the amount of gross sales of Aeroquin-Related Products
in such calendar quarter, on a country-by-country basis; (B) a breakdown of
any deductions from such gross sales to obtain Net Sales for such calendar
quarter, on a country-by-country basis; and (C) any Revenue-Based Contingent
Payment that may be due to the Seller for such calendar quarter. When the
Purchaser provides the report to the Seller for a calendar quarter, the
Purchaser shall cause to be paid to the Seller, in cash, any amount owed
pursuant to this Section 2.2 with respect to the Net Sales of Aeroquin-
Related Products in all countries in such calendar quarter.

(c) _Interest on Late Payments_. If any undisputed Revenue-Based Contingent
Payment owed to the Seller under this Agreement is not paid by the Purchaser
within a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 30 days, following the due
date of such payment, then the Purchaser shall pay interest on the undisputed
and unpaid portion thereof at a rate of [***]% per annum, or if lower, the
maximum interest rate permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, such
interest to run from the date upon which payment of such undisputed
amount became due until payment in full of the undisputed and unpaid portion
thereof. No interest shall accrue on any amounts that the Purchaser believed
in good faith were not owed pursuant to this Section 2.2.

 

(d) _Records_. The Purchaser shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries to and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its sublicensees to keep
accurate and complete records and accounts of the sale of Aeroquin-Related
Products (including records and accounts of gross sales and Net Sales of
Aeroquin-Related Products) in accordance with GAAP (or, in the case of
a sublicensee, the customary accounting system for such sublicensee). The
Purchaser shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries to and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its sublicensees to retain such records and
accounts until three years after the end of the period to which such books
and records pertain.

(e) _Audits_. The Purchaser shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries to and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its sublicensees to, upon
reasonable written notice from the Seller as described in the next sentence,
make the books and records maintained pursuant to Section 2.2(d), as they
relate to the sale of Aeroquin-Related Products, available for audit by an
independent third party accounting firm that executes an appropriate
confidentiality agreement. If an audit of the records for any particular
calendar year is requested by the Seller, the Seller shall deliver to the
Purchaser, prior to June 30th of the following calendar year, a notice (i)
requesting such an audit and (ii) identifying an independent third party
accounting firm that the Seller wishes to select for the purpose of
conducting such audit; _provided, however_ , that the accounting firm must be
an independent, certified public accounting firm of nationally recognized
standing, and reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser. Any such accounting
firm shall be retained jointly by the Purchaser and the Seller. Subject to the
last sentence of this clause (e), the audit will be paid for by the Seller.
Such audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at a
mutually determined location, and not more than once in any calendar year
(unless the Purchaser restates or revises its relevant records for such
calendar year, in which case, notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, such
restated or revised records shall be subject to the audit procedure set forth
in this Section 2.2). If the audit discovers an unmet payment obligation, the
Purchaser shall pay such unpaid amounts, with any interest payable in
accordance with Section 2.2(c), to the Seller within 30 days after the date
the audit is completed and the results are finalized; and if the audit
discovers an overpayment, the Seller shall refund the overpayment within 30
days after the audit is completed and the results are finalized. If as
a result of the audit it is finally determined that the aggregate amount of
the Revenue-Based Contingent Payments that should have been paid to the Seller
for the audited calendar year exceeds the aggregate amount of the Revenue-
Based Contingent Payments actually paid to the Seller by [***]% or more for
such calendar year, then the Purchaser shall be responsible for, and promptly
pay for, the cost of the audit. The determination under such audit shall be
final and binding on both parties absent manifest error.

(f) _Payment Currency_. Subject to Section 1.5, all payments owed under this
Agreement shall be made in United States dollars.

foregoing:

(i) neither the Purchaser nor any of its current or future Affiliates,
successors or assigns (including any Acquiring Party) shall have any

2.4(a)(v), 2.4(b)(iv), 2.4(b)(v), 2.4(c)(iv), 2.4(d)(iv) and 2.4(d)(v))
constitutes a "safe harbor" for determining whether such obligations have

other provision that in any way limits or restricts the ability of the Seller
(or, after the Closing, the ability of the Purchaser or any of its current or
future Affiliates) to use, exploit, assert or enforce any Transferred IP

intentional misrepresentation) in connection with or relating to (i) the
negotiation, execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, (ii) the
due diligence investigation conducted by the Purchaser and its Affiliates and

(f) any claim held or asserted by any Person, or any actual or alleged
Liability, arising directly or indirectly out of, or relating directly or
indirectly to, any of the Rescission Transactions or other transactions,
actions or other matters referred to in the Rescission Agreement, including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any claim or Liability relating directly
or indirectly to (i) any failure of the Rescission Transactions or the
contributions of Reversionary Asset Rights contemplated by the Rescission
Agreement to be valid, effective and enforceable, (ii) any failure of the
Seller to have held and had good, valid and marketable title to all of the
Reversionary Asset Rights immediately prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or (iii) any failure of the Seller to duly assign and transfer
to the Purchaser, and any failure of the Purchaser to acquire, at the
Closing, good, valid and marketable title to any Reversionary Asset Rights it
holds as of the Closing Date, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances and subject to the terms and conditions of the
Reversionary Letter Agreement);

(g) any actual or alleged violation or breach of, or actual or alleged
default under, the Reversionary Asset Transfer Agreement or the Reversionary

(i) any failure of the Purchaser to acquire good, valid and marketable title
to any of the Transferred Assets, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other
than Permitted Encumbrances); or

 

(j) any claim held or asserted by any past, current or alleged member of the
Seller or by any Seller Predecessor against any Indemnitee (except for (i)
any meritorious claim asserting that the Purchaser has failed to timely
perform an Assumed Obligation or (ii) any claim by a Seller Predecessor that
is not directly or indirectly related to any of the Transferred Assets, the
Aeroquin Business or any of the Contemplated Transactions).

10.3 Limitations.

 

(a) _Limitations on Indemnification for Breaches of Representations and
Warranties_ ,

 

(i) _Threshold_. Subject to Section 10.3(b), the Seller shall not be required
to make any payments in satisfaction of its Indemnification Obligations under
Sections 10.2(a) and 10.2(b) with respect to inaccuracies in or breaches of
the SellerÂ’s representations and warranties set forth in Section 3 until such
time as the total amount of all Damages that have been directly or

 indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Indemnitees, or to
which any one or more of the Indemnitees has or have otherwise directly or
indirectly become subject, exceeds (without double-counting such Damages)
$[***] (the " _Threshold Amount_ "). If the total amount of such Damages
exceeds the Threshold Amount, then the Indemnitees shall have the right to
seek Indemnification under this Section 10 for the entire amount of such
Damages, and not merely the portion of such Damages exceeding the Threshold
Amount.

(ii)  _General Representations Cap_. Subject to Section 10.3(b) (and without
limiting the PurchaserÂ’s right to make claims or receive recoveries under the
RandW Insurance Policy), the SellerÂ’s Indemnification Obligations
under Sections 10.2(a) and 10.2(b) with respect to inaccuracies in or
breaches of the General Representations (other than the Uninsured
Representations) and the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
3.5(a)(iii) and 3.5(h)(ii) shall be limited to payment of cash amounts not
exceeding in the aggregate the sum of: (A) the Indemnification Escrow Amount;
and (B) $[***] (it being understood that the amount referred to in this clause
"(B)" may only be recovered by deducting and withholding such amount from,
and setting off such amount against, any Contingent Payments payable by the
Purchaser).

 

(iii) _Uninsured Representations Cap_. Subject to Section 10.3(b), the
SellerÂ’s Indemnification Obligations under Sections 10.2(a) and 10.2(b) with
respect to inaccuracies in or breaches of the Uninsured Representations shall
be limited to payment of cash amounts not exceeding in the aggregate the sum
of: (A) the Indemnification Escrow Amount; and (B) $[***] (it being
understood that the amount referred to in this clause "(B)" may only be
recovered by deducting and withholding such amount from, and setting off such
amount against, any Contingent Payments payable by the Purchaser).

(iv) _Fundamental Representations Cap_. Subject to Section 10.3(b)
(and without limiting the PurchaserÂ’s right to make claims or receive
recoveries under the RandW Insurance Policy), the SellerÂ’s Indemnification
Obligations under Sections 10.2(a) and 10.2(b) with respect to inaccuracies in
or breaches of the Fundamental Representations shall be limited to payment of
cash amounts not exceeding in the aggregate the sum of: (A) the
Indemnification Escrow Amount; and (B) $[***] (it being understood that the
amount referred to in this clause "(B)" may only be recovered by deducting
and withholding such amount from, and setting off such amount against, any
Contingent Payments payable by the Purchaser).

 

(b) _Application of Limitations_. None of the limitations set forth in Section
10.3(a) shall apply to Indemnification Obligations arising from or relating
to (i) any fraud or intentional misrepresentation (whether on the part of the
Seller, any Seller Member or any past, current or future Affiliate or
Representative of the Seller or any Seller Member), (ii) any of the matters
referred to in [***] or (iii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the
Seller in this Agreement (the Indemnification Obligations referred to in this
sentence, the " _Designated Indemnification Obligations_ "). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing (and without limiting any of the other
remedies the Purchaser may exercise to ensure or compel the satisfaction of
the Designated Indemnification Obligations), the Purchaser shall be entitled
to exercise unlimited rights of deduction, withholding and setoff from and
against any and all Contingent Payments as a means of providing for the
satisfaction of the Designated Indemnification Obligations. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 10 (but subject to the
PurchaserÂ’s rights to exercise tort-based remedies against Persons involved in
the commission of torts), except in the context of recovering Damages that may
be payable by the Seller to any Indemnitee in connection with any of the
SellerÂ’s Designated Indemnification Obligations, (A) once the Aggregate
Closing Payment Amount has been paid to the Seller, such amount shall not be
subject to recovery by any Indemnitee under this Agreement, and (B) once any
Contingent Payment has been made by the Purchaser to the Seller, such
Contingent Payment shall not be subject to recovery by any Indemnitee under
this

47 CONFIDENTIAL

 



 

 Agreement. Notwithstanding the introductory language of the previous
sentence, once the Aggregate Closing Payment Amount has been paid to the
Seller, the funds comprising such Aggregate Closing Payment Amount shall not
be subject to recovery pursuant to clause "(f)," "(g)," "(h)" or "(i)" of
Section 10.2; _provided, however,_ that nothing in this sentence or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall limit or otherwise affect (1) the right of the
Purchaser or any other Indemnitee to recover the Aggregate Closing Payment
Amount pursuant to clause "(d)," "(e)" or "(j)" of Section 10.2 or (2) any of
the other remedies that the Purchaser or any other Indemnitee may exercise to
ensure or compel the satisfaction of the Designated Indemnification
Obligations.

 

10.4 Order of Recourse.

 

(a) _Order of Recourse for General and Fundamental Representations_. In the
event the Indemnitees are entitled to recover Damages under Section 10.2(a)
or Section 10.2(b) for breaches of General Representations or Fundamental
Representations, the Indemnitees shall seek to recover such Damages in the
following order: (i) first, from the Indemnification Escrow Fund, to the
extent the amount of cash remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Fund exceeds
the Claimed Amounts under all then pending but unresolved Indemnification
claims; (ii) second (other than with respect to Damages for inaccuracies in
or breaches of any Uninsured Representations), from the RandW Insurer under the
RandW Insurance Policy, to the extent of the dollar amount of coverage under the
RandW Insurance Policy (not counting any applicable retention, deductible or
basket) that (A) remains available at such time under the RandW Insurance
Policy to insure the Purchaser with respect to the particular representations
and warranties at issue and (B) is not subject at such time to pending but
unresolved claims; and (iii) third, pursuant to the PurchaserÂ’s rights of
deduction, withholding and setoff with respect to any Contingent Payments;
_provided, however,_ that the Indemnitees need not make a claim against, or
otherwise proceed to seek recovery under, the RandW Insurance Policy with
respect to such Damages (and may proceed immediately to exercise their rights
of deduction, withholding and setoff with respect to Contingent Payments) to
the extent the Purchaser believes in good faith that such Damages would
reasonably be expected to be excluded from coverage under the RandW Insurance
Policy.

(b) _No Order of Recourse for Designated Indemnification Obligations_. Except
as specifically provided in Section 10.4(a): (i) neither the Purchaser nor any
other Indemnitee shall have any obligation to, and neither the PurchaserÂ’s nor
any other IndemniteeÂ’s rights to Indemnification pursuant to Section 10.2
shall be limited by any failure to, seek recovery of any Damages from the
Indemnification Escrow Fund or the RandW Insurance Policy or to exercise any
rights or remedies under this Agreement in any particular order; and (ii) the
Indemnitees may exercise all of their respective rights and remedies against
the Seller simultaneously or in any order they may elect. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing (and without limiting any of the other remedies
the Purchaser may exercise to ensure or compel the satisfaction of the
Designated Indemnification Obligations), at the PurchaserÂ’s election, (i) the
Purchaser may proceed directly against the Seller in order to compel the
Seller to satisfy its Designated Indemnification Obligations and/or (ii) the
Purchaser may exercise unlimited rights of deduction and withholding from, and
setoff against, any and all Contingent Payments as a means of providing for
the satisfaction of the Designated Indemnification Obligations.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 10.4(a), Section
10.4(c),Section 10.4(d) or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Purchaser
nor any other Indemnitee shall have any obligation to, and neither the
PurchaserÂ’s nor any other IndemniteeÂ’s rights to Indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement shall be limited by any failure to, threaten or commence any
Legal Proceeding against the RandW Insurer for the purpose of recovering Damages
under the RandW Insurance Policy.

 

(c) _R andW Insurance Claims Process_. If the Purchaser makes a claim against
the RandW Insurance Policy to recover Damages under Section 10.2(a) or Section
10.2(b) for breaches of General Representations (other than Uninsured
Representations) or Fundamental Representations, the

48 CONFIDENTIAL

 



 

 Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to recover
such Damages under the RandW Insurance Policy; _provided, however,_ that (i) if
the RandW Insurer denies coverage with respect to such claim, the Purchaser
shall not be required to take any further action, except to the extent the
Purchaser determines in good faith that it would be reasonable to pursue the
RandW InsurerÂ’s internal appeals process with respect to such claim and (ii)
under no circumstances shall the Purchaser be required to commence or threaten
the commencement of any litigation, arbitration proceeding or other Legal
Proceeding against the RandW Insurer or any other Person.

(d) _R andW Insurance Claims Withholding_. If the Purchaser makes or proposes to
make a claim against the RandW Insurance Policy with respect to any Damages,
then (subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 10.3(a)(ii) and
10.3(a)(iv)), the Purchaser may immediately withhold and deduct the amount of
such Damages from, and set off the amount of such Damages against, any
Contingent Payments that are or become payable (it being understood that the
lesser of the amount so deducted and withheld from such Contingent Payments
and the net amount of the recovery obtained from the RandW Insurer with respect
to such claim will be paid to the Seller within 10 business days after the
Purchaser receives payment of such claim from the RandW Insurer).

 

10.5 Recovery from Third Parties. [***].

 

10.6 No Subrogation. Effective as of the Closing, the Seller expressly waives
and releases any and all rights of subrogation, contribution, advancement and
indemnification, and, except for the rights of the Seller expressly provided
in this Agreement, all other claims against the Purchaser.

 

10.7 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding with respect to
which the Seller may become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate
or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 10, the Purchaser shall
have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of such claim
or Legal Proceeding on its own. If the Purchaser so proceeds with the defense
of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:

(a) for the avoidance of doubt, all reasonable expenses relating to the
defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding shall be recoverable Damages for
purposes of this Section 10;

 

(b) the Seller shall make available to the Purchaser any documents and
materials in the SellerÂ’s possession or control that may be reasonably
necessary to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding;

(c) the Purchaser shall keep the Seller reasonably apprised of the material
developments in such claim or Legal Proceeding; and

(d) the Purchaser shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such
claim or Legal Proceeding without the consent of the Seller; _provided,
however,_ that if the Purchaser settles, adjusts or compromises any such claim
or Legal Proceeding without the consent of the Seller, such
settlement, adjustment or compromise shall not be conclusive evidence of: (i)
whether any Damages incurred by an Indemnitee in connection with such claim or
Legal Proceeding are the valid subject of a claim under Section 10.2; or (ii)
the amount of any Damages that are actually suffered or incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with such claim or Legal Proceeding (it being
understood that if the Purchaser requests that the Seller consent to a
settlement, adjustment or compromise, the Seller shall not unreasonably
withhold, delay or condition such consent).

The Purchaser shall give the Seller prompt notice of the commencement of
any such Legal Proceeding against the Purchaser; _provided, however_ , that
any failure on the part of the Purchaser to so notify the

49 CONFIDENTIAL

 



 

 Seller shall not limit any of the Indemnification Obligations of the Seller
(except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the SellerÂ’s rights
hereunder). If the Purchaser does not elect to proceed with the defense,
settlement, adjustment or compromise of any such claim or Legal Proceeding,
the Seller may proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser;  _provided, however,_ that
the Seller may not settle, adjust or compromise any such claim or Legal
Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which consent
may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

10.8 Claim Procedure. Any claim for Indemnification pursuant to this Section
10 shall be brought and resolved exclusively (and, at the option of any
Indemnitee, any claim based upon or relating to fraud or intentional
misrepresentation may be brought and resolved) as follows:

 

(a) If any Indemnitee has or claims in good faith to have incurred or
suffered, or believes in good faith that it may incur or suffer, Damages for
which it is or may be entitled to Indemnification under this Section 10, the
Purchaser may deliver a claim notice on behalf of itself or any other
Indemnitee (a " _Claim Notice_ ") signed by a duly authorized officer of the
Purchaser to the Seller. (The Person on whose behalf the Claim Notice is
delivered, whether it be the Purchaser or another Indemnitee, is referred to
in this Section 10.8 as the "Indemnitee"). A Claim Notice may (but shall not
be required to) specify the particular subsections or clauses of this
Agreement pursuant to which the applicable claim for Indemnification is being
made, and the Purchaser shall be entitled to make multiple claims for
Indemnification (and to deliver multiple Claim Notices) arising from the same
set of facts. Each Claim Notice shall: (x) contain a statement that the
Indemnitee has incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, or reasonably anticipates
that it may incur, pay, reserve or accrue, Damages for which it is or may be
entitled to Indemnification under this Section 10; (y) contain a description,
in reasonable detail, based on the information then in the PurchaserÂ’s
possession and which the Purchaser is not prohibited from disclosing to the
Seller under applicable Contracts or Legal Requirements, of the facts and
circumstances supporting the claims stated in such Claim Notice; and (z) if
practicable, contain a non-binding, preliminary, good faith estimate of the
aggregate amount of Damages that the Indemnitee might incur or suffer in
connection therewith (the aggregate amount of such estimate, as it may be
modified by the Indemnitee in good faith from time to time, being referred to
as the " _Claimed Amount_ "). A Claim Notice shall be deemed to have been
timely delivered if it is delivered to the Seller before the expiration of the
applicable survival period (if any) specified in Section 10.1. Subject to
the preceding sentence, the Purchaser shall be permitted to provide notice of
and otherwise assert claims for Indemnification (on behalf of itself or any
other Indemnitee) at any time and in any order.

 

(b) During the 45-day period commencing upon receipt by the Seller of a Claim
Notice from the Purchaser (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnitee) (the
" _Dispute Period_ "), the Seller may deliver to the Purchaser a written
response (the " _Response Notice_ ") in which the Seller: (i) agrees that the
full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that part, but not
all, of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee; or (iii) indicates that
no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee. If the Response
Notice is delivered in accordance with clause "(ii)" or clause "(iii)" of the
preceding sentence, the Response Notice shall also contain a brief description
of the facts and circumstances supporting the SellerÂ’s claim that only a
portion or no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, as the
case may be. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is not agreed to be owed to
the Indemnitee pursuant to the Response Notice is referred to herein as the "
_Contested Amount_ " (it being understood that the Contested Amount shall be
modified from time to time to reflect any good faith modifications by the
Indemnitee to the Claimed Amount). If a Response Notice is not received by the
Purchaser from the Seller prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period, then
the Seller shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that an amount equal to
the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee.

50 CONFIDENTIAL

 



 

(c) If the Seller in its Response Notice agrees that the full Claimed Amount
is owed to the Indemnitee, or if no Response Notice is received by the
Purchaser from the Seller prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period, then:
(i) if the Indemnitee elects to (or if the Indemnitee is required pursuant to
Section 10.4 to) seek recourse against the Indemnification Escrow Fund,
within three business days following the earlier of the delivery of such
Response Notice or the expiration of the Dispute Period, the Purchaser and the
Seller shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Claimed Amount to the
Indemnitee from the Indemnification Escrow Fund (to the extent of the
Indemnification Escrow Fund), and if the amount held in the Indemnification
Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the full Claimed Amount, then, subject to
Sections 10.3 and 10.9, the Seller shall pay, within 10 business days
following the earlier of the delivery of such Response Notice or the
expiration of the Dispute Period, the amount of such deficiency to the
Indemnitee; and (ii) if the Purchaser does not elect to (and the Indemnitee is
not required pursuant to Section 10.4 to) seek recourse against the
Indemnification Escrow Fund, then, subject to Sections 10.3, 10.4 and 10.9,
the Seller shall pay, within 10 business days following the earlier of the
delivery of such Response Notice or the expiration of the Dispute Period, the
Claimed Amount to the Indemnitee.

 

(d) If the Seller delivers a Response Notice to the Purchaser during the
Dispute Period agreeing that part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount is owed
to the Indemnitee (the " _Agreed Amount_ "), then (i) if the Indemnitee elects
to (or if the Indemnitee is required pursuant to Section 10.4 to) seek
recourse against the Indemnification Escrow Fund, within three business days
following the delivery of such Response Notice, the Seller and the Purchaser
shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Agreed Amount to the
Indemnitee from the Indemnification Escrow Fund (to the extent of the
Indemnification Escrow Fund), and if the amount held in the Indemnification
Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the full Agreed Amount, then, subject to
Sections 10.3 and 10.9, the Seller shall pay, within 10 business days
following the delivery of such Response Notice, the amount of such deficiency
to the Indemnitee; and (ii) if the Purchaser does not elect to (and the
Indemnitee is not required pursuant to Section 10.4 to) seek recourse against
the Indemnification Escrow Fund, then, subject to Sections 10.3, 10.4 and
10.9, the Seller shall pay, within 10 business days following the delivery of
such Response Notice, the Agreed Amount to the Indemnitee.

 

(e) If the Seller delivers a Response Notice to the Purchaser during the
Dispute Period indicating that there is a Contested Amount, the Seller and
the Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to
the Contested Amount. If the Seller and the Indemnitee resolve such dispute,
such resolution shall be binding on the Seller and the Indemnitee and
a settlement agreement stipulating the amount owed to the Indemnitee by the
Seller (the " _Stipulated Amount_ ") shall be signed by the Indemnitee and the
Seller. If the Indemnitee elects to (and the Indemnitee is required pursuant
to Section 10.4 to) seek recourse against the Indemnification Escrow Fund,
within three business days following the execution of such settlement
agreement, or such shorter period of time as may be set forth in the
settlement agreement, the Purchaser and the Seller shall execute and deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
release the Stipulated Amount to the Indemnitee from the Indemnification
Escrow Fund (to the extent of the Indemnification Escrow Fund), and if the
amount held in the Indemnification Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the
full Stipulated Amount, then, subject to Sections 10.3 and 10.9, the Seller
shall pay, within 10 business days following the execution of such settlement
agreement, or such shorter period of time as may be set forth in the
settlement agreement, the amount of such deficiency to the Indemnitee. If the
Purchaser does not elect to (or if the Indemnitee is not required pursuant to
Section 10.4 to) seek recourse against the Indemnification Escrow Fund, then,
subject to Sections 10.3, 10.4 and 10.9, the Seller shall pay, within 10
business days following the execution of such settlement agreement, or
such shorter period of time as may be set forth in the settlement agreement,
the Stipulated Amount to the Indemnitee.

(f) In the event that there is a dispute relating to any Claim Notice or
Contested Amount (whether it is a matter between the Indemnitee, on the one
hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, or it is a matter that is subject to
a claim or Legal Proceeding asserted or commenced by a third party brought
against the Indemnitee), such dispute (an " _Arbitrable Dispute_ ") shall be
settled by binding arbitration. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
nothing in this Section 10.8(f) shall prevent the Indemnitee from seeking
preliminary injunctive relief or other equitable relief from a court of
competent jurisdiction pending settlement of any Arbitrable Dispute.

(i) Except as herein specifically stated, any Arbitrable Dispute shall be
resolved by arbitration in San Francisco, California in accordance with JAMSÂ’
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the " _JAMS Rules_ ") then in
effect. However, in all events, the provisions contained herein shall govern
over any conflicting rules which may now or hereafter be contained in the JAMS
Rules. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
in any court having jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof. The
arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any equitable and legal remedies
that would be available if any judicial proceeding was instituted to resolve
an Arbitrable Dispute. The existence of any such arbitration and the terms of
the Arbitrable Dispute shall be kept confidential by the Indemnitee and the
Seller.

 

(ii) Any such arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator who
will be compensated for his or her services at a rate to be determined by the
Indemnitee and the Seller or by JAMS, but based upon reasonable hourly or
daily consulting rates for the arbitrator in the event the parties to the
arbitration are not able to agree upon his or her rate of compensation.

(iii) The arbitrator shall be mutually agreed upon by the Indemnitee and the
Seller. In the event the Indemnitee and the Seller are unable to agree within
20 days following submission of the dispute to JAMS by one of the parties to
the arbitration, JAMS will have the authority to select an arbitrator from a
list of arbitrators who satisfy the criteria set forth in clause "(iv)"
hereof.

(iv) No arbitrator shall have any past or present family, business or other
relationship with the Indemnitee, the Seller, the Seller Members or any of
their respective past, current or future Affiliates or directors or officers,
unless following full disclosure of all such relationships, the Indemnitee
and the Seller agree in writing to waive such requirement with respect to an
individual in connection with any dispute.

(v) The arbitrator shall be instructed to hold an up to eight hour, one day
hearing regarding the disputed matter within 60 days of his or her designation
and to render an award (without written opinion) no later than 30 days after
the conclusion of such hearing, in each case unless otherwise mutually agreed
in writing by the Indemnitee. The final decision of the arbitrator: (A) shall
include the amount of the award to the Indemnitee to be paid by the Seller
(the " _Award Amount_ "), if any; (B) shall be furnished to the Indemnitee
and the Seller in writing; and (C) shall constitute a conclusive determination
of the issue(s) in question, shall be binding upon the Indemnitee and the
Seller and shall not be contested by any of them.

(vi) No discovery other than an exchange of relevant documents may occur in
any arbitration commenced under the provisions of this Section 10.8(f). The
Indemnitee and the Seller shall act in good faith to promptly exchange
relevant documents.

 

(vii) The Indemnitee, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, will
each pay 50% of the initial compensation to be paid to the arbitrator in any
such arbitration and

52 CONFIDENTIAL

 



 

 50% of the costs of transcripts and other normal and regular expenses of the
arbitration proceedings; _provided, however,_ that: (A) the prevailing party
in any arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorneysÂ’ fees and costs;
and (B) all costs of arbitration, other than those provided for above, will be
paid by the losing party, and the arbitrator will be authorized to determine
the identity of the prevailing party and the losing party. The losing party
shall be determined solely by the arbitrator. If the Indemnitee is found to be
the prevailing party in any arbitration, the amount of the fees and expenses
of the Indemnitee payable by the Seller pursuant to this clause "(vii)" shall
be added to the Award Amount.

(viii) The arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions will not
have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these
arbitration provisions or any other provisions contained in this Section
10.8(f) or elsewhere in this Agreement.

 

(ix) For the avoidance of doubt, without the prior written approval of the
Purchaser, the arbitrator shall have no authority or jurisdiction to decide
or adjudicate any dispute or other matter regarding the performance by the
Purchaser of any of its obligations under Section 1, Section 2 or any other
provision of this Agreement (it being understood that, unless the Purchaser
elects otherwise, all such disputes and other matters shall be adjudicated and
decided in court proceedings in accordance with Section 11.8).

 

(g) Upon resolution of an Arbitrable Dispute: (i) if the Indemnitee elects to
(or if the Indemnitee is required pursuant to Section 10.4 to) seek recourse
against the Indemnification Escrow Fund, within three business days following
the entry of the arbitratorÂ’s decision by a court of competent jurisdiction,
or such shorter period of time as may be set forth in the arbitratorÂ’s
decision, the Seller and the Purchaser shall execute and deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release the
Award Amount to the Indemnitee from the Indemnification Escrow Fund (to the
extent of the Indemnification Escrow Fund), and if the amount held in the
Indemnification Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the full Award Amount,
then, subject to Sections 10.3, 10.4 and 10.9, the Seller shall pay, within 10
business days following the entry of the arbitratorÂ’s decision by a court of
competent jurisdiction, or such shorter period of time as may be set forth in
the arbitratorÂ’s decision, the amount of such deficiency to the Indemnitee;
and (ii) if the Purchaser does not elect to (and the Indemnitee is not
required pursuant to Section 10.4 to) seek recourse against the
Indemnification Escrow Fund, then, subject to Sections 10.3, 10.4 and 10.9,
the Seller shall pay, within 10 business days following the entry of the

(h) Subject to Section 10.9, within 10 business days following the General

10.9 Setoff, Etc.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to any expressly applicable limitations set forth in Section 10.3 or
Section 10.4, the Purchaser shall have the right at any time to withhold and
deduct the amount of any Damages that it determines in good faith may be or
become payable to any Indemnitee under this Section 10 from, and set off such
amount against, any Contingent Payment (it being understood that if the
Purchaser has not yet delivered a Claim Notice to the Seller with respect to
such Damages, the Purchaser shall be required to deliver to the Seller, within
10 days after setting off any such Damages against any such Contingent
Payment, a notice that the Purchaser (i) has set off all or a portion of such
Damages against such Contingent Payment and (ii) intends to deliver a Claim
Notice with respect to such Damages).

(b) At the election of the Purchaser, but subject to any applicable
limitations in Section 10.3 or 10.4, any obligation of the Seller to pay an
amount of Damages to any Indemnitee pursuant to Section 10 may be satisfied by
(i) payment of such amount of Damages in cash to such Indemnitee by the
Seller, (ii) the disbursement to such Indemnitee of such amount of Damages
from the cash remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Fund and/or (iii) the
deduction and withholding of such amount of Damages from, and setting off of
such amount of Damages against, any Contingent Payment otherwise payable to
the Seller. Any amount deducted or withheld from, or set off against, any
Contingent Payment shall be treated for all purposes as having been properly
paid to the Seller under this Agreement.

 

10.10 Exercise of Remedies Other than by the Purchaser. No Indemnitee (other
than the Purchaser or the PurchaserÂ’s successor or assign with respect to the
PurchaserÂ’s rights under this Agreement) shall be permitted to assert any
claim for Indemnification under Section 10.2 unless the Purchaser (or the
PurchaserÂ’s successor or assign with respect to the PurchaserÂ’s rights under
this Agreement) shall have consented to the assertion of such claim in
writing.

10.11 Tax Treatment of Payments. The Purchaser and the Seller agree to treat
any payments made pursuant to this Section 10 as adjustments to the
consideration for the Transferred Assets for U. S. federal, state, and local
income tax purposes to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.

10.12 Exclusive Remedy. Subject to Sections 11.2 and 11.8 (and without
limiting the PurchaserÂ’s rights under the RandW Insurance Policy), this Section
10 shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the Indemnitees against
the Seller under this Agreement for claims against the Seller resulting from
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller
contained in this Agreement or failure to perform any covenant or obligation
of the Seller contained in this Agreement, other than (a) claims relating to
fraud or intentional misrepresentation, and (b) claims seeking specific
performance, injunctive relief or other equitable relief.



   11. | MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
---|--- 

11.1 Further Actions; License; Power of Attorney.

(a) _Further Actions_. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Seller
shall cooperate with the Purchaser and the Representatives of the Purchaser,
and shall cause to be executed and delivered such documents and take such
other actions as the Purchaser may reasonably request, for the purpose of
evidencing the Contemplated Transactions and putting the Purchaser or its
designee(s) in possession and control of all of the Transferred Assets.

54 CONFIDENTIAL

 



 

(b) _Specified Assets_. To the extent that the Seller is unable to obtain
any Consent that the Purchaser reasonably deems to be required, necessary or
advisable for the transfer to the Purchaser of any of the Transferred Assets
prior to the Closing: (i) such Transferred Asset (a " _Specified Asset_ ")
shall not be assigned or transferred to the Purchaser until such time as such
Consent is obtained; and (ii) the Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to
obtain such Consent as promptly as practicable thereafter. Until such Consent
is obtained, the Seller shall cooperate, and shall use its reasonable efforts
to cause its current and future Representatives to cooperate, with the
Purchaser in any lawful arrangement designed to provide the Purchaser with the
benefits of such Specified Asset at a cost to the Purchaser not to be in
excess of the cost the Purchaser would have incurred (without modification to
the terms of any Contract) if the Consent had been obtained. If all such
Consents with respect to any Specified Asset are obtained after the Closing
Date, such Specified Asset shall, automatically and without further action of
the Parties, be deemed to have been assigned and transferred to the Purchaser
on the date the last such Consent is obtained.

 

(c) _Post-Closing Transfers_. If, following the Closing, the Purchaser or the
Seller identifies any Asset that has not been transferred to the Purchaser
and that either (i) is owned or held for use by the Seller or any current or
future Affiliate of the Seller and is determined by the Purchaser in good
faith to be an Asset which should have been included in the Transferred
Assets or which relates to or may be useful in connection with the Transferred
Assets or the Aeroquin Business or (ii) is owned or held for use by any Seller
Predecessor and is an Asset which the Seller had the right to acquire
from such Seller Predecessor prior to the Closing Date and which would have
been included in the Transferred Assets had the Seller exercised such right
prior to the Closing Date, then: (A) if the identification of such Asset was
made by the Seller, the Seller shall promptly notify the Purchaser of the
existence of such Asset; and (B) if the Purchaser decides to acquire such
Asset and notifies the Seller of its decision to acquire such Asset, the
Seller shall promptly, without any payment or delivery by the Purchaser of
any further consideration, cause to be executed and delivered such instruments
of sale, assignment, transfer and conveyance with respect to such Asset as the
Purchaser may reasonably request in order to cause such Asset (or, if such
Asset is or relates to a Contract, all of the rights of the Seller and its
Affiliates or such Seller Predecessor under such Contract) to be sold,
assigned, transferred, conveyed and delivered to the Purchaser, and to cause
the Purchaser to be fully vested in such Asset, to have good, valid and
marketable title to such Asset and to gain possession of such Asset, as
applicable (such Asset being deemed to be, and to have been at all times since
the date of this Agreement, a "Transferred Asset" under this Agreement).

(d) _Licenses_. Effective as of the Closing Date, to the extent that
any purported assignment of Transferred IP to the Purchaser under this
Agreement is invalid or ineffective for any reason, the Seller hereby grants a
perpetual, irrevocable, exclusive (even as to the Seller), freely
transferable, worldwide, royalty-free and fully paid-up license (with the
right to grant sublicenses through multiple levels of sublicensees) (i) to
reproduce, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform, publicly
display, digitally transmit, use and otherwise exploit any and all
Transferred IP and other Transferred Assets as to which such purported
assignment was ineffective, in any medium or format, whether now known or
hereafter discovered, (ii) to use, make, have made, sell, offer to sell,
import and otherwise exploit any products or services based on, embodying,
incorporating or derived from such Transferred IP or other Transferred Assets,
(iii) to exercise any and all other present or future rights in such
Transferred IP and other Transferred Assets, and (iv) to practice any method
or perform any process necessary or useful in connection with the exercise of
any of the foregoing license rights.

 

(e) _Prosecution; Subrogation_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
other provisions of this Section 11.1, with respect to any Asset described in
Section 11.1(c)(ii), upon the PurchaserÂ’s request and in consultation with the
Purchaser, the Seller shall exercise all of its rights and remedies against
any Seller Predecessor in order to achieve the purposes of this Agreement and
this Section 11.1, and the Purchaser shall be fully subrogated to all such
rights and remedies of the Seller

Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to portions of this

55 CONFIDENTIAL

 



 

 against such Seller Predecessor (except to the extent prohibited under the
Mpex Merger Agreement, Reversionary Letter Agreement and Reversionary Asset
Transfer Agreement). The Seller shall cooperate, and shall use its reasonable
efforts to cause its current and future Representatives to cooperate, with the
Purchaser in any lawful arrangement designed to provide the Purchaser with the
benefits of all of the SellerÂ’s rights and remedies against each Seller
Predecessor. Upon request of the Purchaser, the Seller shall, at the
reasonable cost and expense of the Purchaser, assert any claims, rights,
remedies and/or defenses that the Seller may have against any
Seller Predecessor and that directly or indirectly arise under or relate to
the Mpex Merger Agreement, the Reversionary Asset Purchase Agreement, the
Reversionary Letter Agreement and/or the Reversionary Net Sales Obligations,
and the Purchaser shall be fully subrogated to all such rights and remedies
of the Seller (except to the extent prohibited under the Mpex Merger
Agreement, Reversionary Letter Agreement and Reversionary Asset Transfer
Agreement). The Seller shall not amend or terminate, or waive or assign any
of its rights or remedies under, the Reversionary Asset Transfer Agreement or
the Reversionary Letter Agreement, and shall not assign, transfer,
hypothecate, encumber (other than with a Permitted Encumbrance) or reduce
its beneficial interest in any of the Reversionary Asset Rights.

(f) _Power of Attorney_. Effective at the Closing, the Seller hereby
irrevocably nominates, constitutes and appoints the Purchaser as the SellerÂ’s
agent and true and lawful attorney in fact (with full power of substitution
and authority) to act in the name, place and stead of the Seller for purposes
of taking any action that the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion,
determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate for the purpose of
enforcing, perfecting or asserting any right or defense under the Reversionary
Letter Agreement or the Reversionary Asset Transfer Agreement. The power of
attorney granted pursuant to this Section 11.1(f) is coupled with an interest
(the sufficiency of which to render such power of attorney irrevocable is
hereby acknowledged), is irrevocable and shall survive the dissolution,
liquidation and/or winding-up of the Seller. Any Person shall be entitled to
rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any
document, instrument, agreement or contract executed or purported to be
executed on behalf of the Seller by the Purchaser and on any other action
taken or purported to be taken on behalf of the Seller by the Purchaser
pursuant to the power of attorney granted pursuant to this Section 11.1(f) as
fully binding upon the Seller.

(g) _Anti-Dissolution_. The Seller shall not, at any time during the
Designated Period, (i) dissolve or liquidate itself or its assets
(voluntarily, involuntarily or otherwise), (ii) make any election to be, or
permit itself or its assets to be, dissolved or liquidated (voluntarily,
involuntarily or otherwise) or (iii) commence any proceedings or take any
other action with the intent or effect of causing itself or its assets to be
dissolved or liquidated (voluntarily, involuntarily or otherwise) or directly
or indirectly facilitating any dissolution or liquidation of itself or its
assets (whether voluntary, involuntary or otherwise). " _Designated Period_ "
means the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the latest of
(A) the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, (B) the date as of which any
Indemnification claim that remains unresolved on or after such seventh
anniversary is fully and finally resolved, (C) the date as of which any claim
for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement against the Seller under
the Registration Rights Agreement that remains unresolved on or after such
seventh anniversary is fully and finally resolved and (D) the date as of which
all obligations and Liabilities that may be owed to the Seller under the
Reversionary Asset Transfer Agreement, and all obligations and Liabilities
that may be owed to the Seller, the SRC and/or the Seller Members under the
Reversionary Letter Agreement, have been fully performed and discharged.
Nothing in this Section 11.1(g) shall limit any of the PurchaserÂ’s rights, or
any of the SellerÂ’s obligations, under Section 11.9.

11.2 No Waiver Relating to Claims for Fraud, Etc. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the liability of the Seller under
Section 10 will be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other Liability
that the Seller may have at law or in equity based on any fraud or
intentional misrepresentation committed by or with the actual knowledge of the
Seller or in which the

 Seller is otherwise involved. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, none of the provisions set forth in this
Agreement, including the provisions set forth in Section 10, shall be deemed
a waiver by either Party of any right or remedy which such Party may have at
law or in equity against any Person based on any fraud or intentional
misrepresentation committed by or with the actual knowledge of such Person or
in which such Person is otherwise involved, nor will any such provisions
limit, or be deemed to limit: (a) the amounts of recovery that may be sought
or awarded in any such claim for fraud or intentional misrepresentation
against such Person; (b) the time period during which a claim for fraud or
intentional misrepresentation may be brought against such Person; or (c) the
recourse that may be sought against such Person with respect to a claim for
fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

11.3 Fees and Expenses. Subject to Sections 1.6, 10, the Escrow Agreement and
the deduction described in clause "(b)" of the definition of "Aggregate
Closing Payment Amount," each Party shall bear and pay all fees, costs and
expenses that have been incurred or that are incurred in the future by such
Party in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, including all fees,
costs and expenses incurred by such Party in connection with or by virtue of:
(a) the negotiation, preparation and review of this Agreement (including the
Disclosure Schedule) and all agreements, certificates, opinions and other
instruments and documents delivered or to be delivered in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions; (b) the preparation and submission of any filing or
notice required to be made or given in connection with any of the
Contemplated Transactions, and the obtaining of any Consent required to be
obtained in connection with any of the Contemplated Transactions; and (c) the
consummation of the Asset Purchase Transaction.

 

11.4 AttorneysÂ’ Fees. If any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement or
the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is brought against any
Party, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneysÂ’
fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to any other relief to which the
prevailing party may be entitled).

 

11.5 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any Party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed properly delivered, given and received: (a) if delivered by hand, when
delivered; (b) if sent on a business day by facsimile transmission and receipt
is confirmed, when transmitted; (c) if sent by facsimile transmission on a
day other than a business day and receipt is confirmed, or if sent by
facsimile transmission after 5:00 p.m. on the day sent by facsimile and
receipt is confirmed, on the business day following the date which receipt is

telephone number as such Party shall have specified in a written notice given
to the other Party (it being understood that the Seller Representative,
despite not being a Party, may modify the notice information of the Seller
Representative upon written notice to the Parties)). Without limiting the
immediately preceding sentence, any notice or other communication required or
permitted to be delivered to the Seller or the Seller Representative under
this Agreement in connection with Section 2 and/or Section 10 shall be deemed
properly delivered, given and received if such notice or other communication

11.8 Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.

 

(a) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and
governed in all respects by, the internal laws of the State of Delaware
(without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws). Any claim by
either Party relating to any of the Contemplated Transactions and alleging
fraud or any other tortious conduct shall also be governed by the internal
laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to principles of
conflicts of laws).

(b) _Venue_. Except as otherwise provided in the Escrow Agreement or in
Section 11.8(c), any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or
the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement (including a suit, action
or proceeding based upon fraud or intentional misrepresentation) shall be
brought or otherwise commenced exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (unless the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over
such suit, action or proceeding, in which case such suit, action
or proceeding shall be brought or otherwise commenced

59 CONFIDENTIAL

 



 

 exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware). Each Party: (i) expressly and irrevocably consents and submits to
the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and the
Delaware Supreme Court to the extent any judgment or order of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware is appealed thereto) (unless the federal
courts have exclusive jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, in
which case each Party consents and submits to the jurisdiction of the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware (and the United States
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to the extent any judgment or order of
such District Court is appealed thereto)) in connection with any such suit,
action or proceeding; (ii) agrees that each of the courts referred to in the
preceding clause "(i)" shall be deemed to be a convenient forum; and (iii)
agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise), in any
such suit, action or proceeding commenced in any of the courts referred to in
the preceding clause "(i)" that such Party is not subject personally to the
jurisdiction of such court, that such suit, action or proceeding has been
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such proceeding is
improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement may
not be enforced in or by such court.

 

(c) _Indemnification Claims_. Any claim for Indemnification pursuant to
Section 10 (and, at the option of any Indemnitee, any other claim for a
monetary remedy, such as in the case of a claim based upon fraud or
intentional misrepresentation relating to this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions after the Closing) shall be brought and resolved exclusively
in accordance with Section 10.8 (it being understood that, for the avoidance
of doubt and without limiting any portion of Section 11.8(b): (i) at the
option of any Indemnitee, any claim based upon fraud or intentional
misrepresentation may be brought and resolved in accordance with Section
11.8(b) rather than in accordance with Section 10.8; and (ii) nothing in this
Section 11.8(c) shall prevent any Indemnitee from seeking preliminary
injunctive relief or other equitable relief from a court of competent
jurisdiction or prevent the Purchaser from seeking recovery under the RandW
Insurance Policy in accordance with the terms thereof).

 

11.9 Assignment; Successors and Assigns. Neither this Agreement, nor any
right, interest or obligation hereunder, may be assigned (voluntarily,
involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise) by either Party without the
prior written consent of the other Party and any attempt to do so will be
void, except that, without obtaining the consent or approval of the Seller or
of any other Person, the Purchaser may freely assign any or all of its rights
under this Agreement (including its indemnification rights under Section 10)
and/or delegate any or all of its obligations under this Agreement, in whole
or in part, to any current or future Affiliate of the Purchaser, any Person
that acquires all or substantially all of the issued and outstanding voting
shares of the Purchaser or all or substantially all of the Transferred Assets
and, with respect to the PurchaserÂ’s rights to bring claims for fraud with
respect to the representations and warranties insured under the RandW Insurance
Policy, to the RandW Insurer. Subject to the preceding sentence, (a) this
Agreement shall be binding upon (i) the Seller and its successors and assigns
(if any) and (ii) the Purchaser and its successors and assigns (if any); and
(b) this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of (i) the Seller, (ii) the
Purchaser, (iii) the other Indemnitees, and (iv) the respective successors
and assigns (if any) of the foregoing. In connection with matters pertaining
to Sections 2 and 10, the Seller may, in its sole discretion, appoint and
engage, at any time, Fortis Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, or another Person or Persons reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser
(the " _Seller Representative_ "), to serve as the SellerÂ’s agent to give and
receive notices and communications and otherwise deal with the Indemnitees on
the SellerÂ’s behalf in connection with claims for Indemnification by any
Indemnitee and in connection with all other matters relating to the
Contemplated Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Seller Representative (if any) shall have the right and authority, on
behalf of the Seller, to (A) negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises
of and comply with orders of courts with respect to such claims
for Indemnification, (B) assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of and comply with orders of courts with respect to any other
claim by any Indemnitee against the Seller or by the Seller against the
Purchaser or any dispute between any Indemnitee and the Seller, in each case
relating to this Agreement or the

 Contemplated Transactions, and (C) take all other actions that are either
(1) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Seller Representative for
the accomplishment of the foregoing or (2) specifically mandated by the terms
of this Agreement. Such agency may be changed upon written notice to
Purchaser; _provided, however_ , that no such change in agency shall in any
way negate or otherwise affect prior consents, approvals or actions by the
Seller or the Seller Representative. All consents, approvals or actions by the
Seller Representative shall be deemed to be consents, approvals or actions by
the Seller, and the Seller shall not have any right to retract, deny or
otherwise modify such consents, approvals or actions. The engagement and the
appointment of the Seller Representative shall be non-exclusive, and shall in
no way limit: (x) any of the SellerÂ’s Liabilities or any of the PurchaserÂ’s
rights under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or in connection
with any of the Contemplated Transactions, (y) the right or ability of any
Indemnitee to deal with any other Representative of the Seller; or (z) the
right or ability of any other Representative of the Seller to represent or
bind the Seller. The Purchaser, each other Indemnitee and each of their
respective current and future Representatives and Affiliates shall be entitled
to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any
document, instrument, notice, agreement or Contract executed or delivered or
purported to be executed or delivered on behalf of the Seller by the Seller
Representative or any other Representative of the Seller and on any other
action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of the Seller by the Seller
Representative or any other Representative of the Seller as fully binding upon
the Seller.

 

11.10 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. The rights and remedies of
the Parties shall be cumulative (and not alternative). The Parties agree
that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by either Party of any
covenant, obligation or other provision set forth in this Agreement (a) the
other Party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may
be available to it) to (i) a decree or order of specific performance or
mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant,
obligation or other provision and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach
or threatened breach and (b) such other Party shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such decree, order
or injunction or in connection with any related action or Legal Proceeding.

 

11.11 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have
waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege
or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power,
right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly
executed and delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not
be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it
is given.

11.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives any
and all right to trial by jury in any Legal Proceeding arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

11.13 Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered or
supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of the Purchaser and the Seller.

 

11.14 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application of any such provision to any Person or set of circumstances,
shall be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any
extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision
to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to
be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or
otherwise affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by law.
