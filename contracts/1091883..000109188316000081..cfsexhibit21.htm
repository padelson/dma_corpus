withhold from any payments to be made pursuant to this Section 2.04 any Taxes
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payments under the Code or any other applicable provision of Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Optionholder on
behalf of whom such deduction and withholding was made. Furthermore, in order
to ensure compliance with all applicable Tax withholding requirements, the
Representative or the Paying Agent at the Representative\'s direction may pay
or direct payment of any funds which are to be paid to or for the benefit of
the Optionholders (including any portion of the Optionholders\' Merger
Consideration) to the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as
applicable) and have such amounts paid through the Surviving Company\'s or any
of its Subsidiaries\' (as applicable) payroll system on the next regularly
scheduled payroll date after the date of receipt of such amounts. Upon payment
of any such amounts to the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the
Representative or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be relieved of its
obligation to pay such amounts to the Optionholders.



2.05 Certificate of Formation. As of the Effective Time, the certificate of
formation of the Surviving Company shall be amended and restated pursuant to
the terms set forth in the Certificate of Merger, and as so amended and
restated, shall be the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company until
amended in accordance with applicable Law.

2.06 Operating Agreement. The operating agreement of the Merger Sub in effect
at the Effective Time shall be the operating agreement of the Surviving
Company (except that the title thereof shall read "Operating Agreement of
Downstream Holding, LLC") and, as so amended and restated, shall be the
operating agreement of the Surviving Company until amended in accordance with
applicable Law.

2.07 Managers and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected or appointed in accordance with applicable Law (or
their earlier resignation or removal), the managers and officers of the Merger
Sub at the Effective Time shall be the managers and officers, as applicable,
of the Surviving Company.

2.08 Withholding. The Purchaser and the Surviving Company (and any other
Person that has any withholding obligation with respect to any payment made
pursuant to this Agreement) and the Representative and the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as the Purchaser, the Surviving Company or such other Person is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other applicable provision of Law; provided, that,
except with respect to payments in the nature of compensation to be made to
employees or former employees, the Purchaser or the Surviving Company, as
applicable, shall provide the Representative with reasonable notice prior to
withholding any amounts pursuant to this Section 2.08, and shall work in good
faith with the Representative to minimize any such withheld amounts. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be timely
paid over to the applicable Tax authority in accordance with applicable Law
and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Delaware and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in
connection with the Merger;

(b) the Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Paying Agent
an aggregate amount equal to the Unitholders\' Closing Consideration (for

accordance with Section 2.02), by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account(s) designated by the Paying Agent;

(c) the Purchaser shall, as instructed by the Representative, deliver or cause
to be delivered to the Company an aggregate amount equal to the
Optionholders\' Closing Consideration (for distribution by the Company to each

as determined in accordance with Section 2.04), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the
Representative;

(d) the Purchaser shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the

(i) the Purchaser, the Merger Sub, the Company and the Representative (on
behalf of the Unitholders and Optionholders) shall make such other deliveries

For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, (i) the failure of any Unitholder (other than the failure of the
Representative in its capacity as a Unitholders hereunder to deliver its
respective Letter of Transmittal) or Optionholder to satisfy any of the
deliveries set forth in Section 2.03 and Section 2.04 shall not affect the
Purchaser\'s obligations to deliver, with respect to the Unitholders, the
Unitholder Closing Consideration to the Paying Agent pursuant to clause (b) of
this Section 3.02 and, with respect to the Optionholders, the Optionholder
Closing Consideration to the Company pursuant to clause (c) of this Section
3.02; and (ii) the provisions of clauses (d) and (h) of this Section 3.02 are
intended for administrative convenience at Closing and neither the Purchaser
nor Merger 

Sub will be deemed liable for the Indebtedness or Transaction Expense by
virtue of this Section 3.02 other than the Purchaser\'s explicit obligations
in the provisions of clauses (d) and (h) of this Section 3.02.

3.03 Closing Cash Proceeds Adjustment.

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company prepared and delivered to the
Purchaser a good‑faith estimate of the Closing Cash Proceeds (the "Estimated
Closing Cash Proceeds"), including each of the components thereof, based on
the Company\'s books and records and other information then available, as
attached hereto as Exhibit G (the "Estimated Closing Statement").

(f) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in no event later than
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to the Representative a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting
forth the Purchaser\'s calculation of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including
each of the components thereof, and a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of 11:59 p.m. prevailing Eastern Time on the
day immediately prior to the Closing, (the "Closing Balance Sheet").

(g) The Closing Balance Sheet shall (i) be prepared, and Closing Working
Capital shall be determined, in accordance with the definitions set forth
herein, including but not limited to the definitions of Current Assets and
Current Liabilities, and with the Working Capital Schedule, which was prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied with past practices of the
Company. The post-Closing purchase price adjustment as set forth in this
Section 3.03 is not intended to permit the introduction of different
accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures, conventions,
categorizations, definitions, or principles with respect to financial
statements, their current or long term classification or presentation or
otherwise (including with respect to the nature of accounts) from those set
forth on, or reflected in, the Working Capital Schedule.

(h) The Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) shall
(i) permit the Representative and its representatives to have reasonable
access at reasonable times and on reasonable notice to the books, records and
other documents (including work papers, schedules, financial statements,
memoranda, etc.) pertaining to or used in connection with the preparation of
the Closing Statement or the Closing Balance Sheet and the Purchaser\'s
calculation of the Closing Cash Proceeds and provide the Representative with
copies thereof (as reasonably requested by the Representative and subject to
the execution of customary work paper access letters, if requested) and (ii)
cause its personnel, employees and advisors (including accountants) and
representatives to cooperate reasonably with the Representative and its
representatives in connection with the Representatives review of the Closing
Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet. If the Representative disagrees with
any part of the Purchaser\'s calculation of the Closing Cash Proceeds as set
forth on the Closing Statement or the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Representative shall, within sixty (60) days after the Representative\'s
receipt of the Closing Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet, notify the
Purchaser in writing of such disagreement by setting forth the
Representative\'s calculation of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of
the components thereof, and describing in reasonable detail the basis for such
disagreement (an "Objection Notice"). If an Objection Notice is not delivered
to the Purchaser within such time period, then the Closing Statement, Closing
Balance Sheet, and Closing Cash Proceeds as prepared by the Purchaser will be
final, binding and non‑appealable by the parties hereto. If an Objection
Notice is delivered to the Purchaser within such time period, then the
Purchaser and the Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
their disagreements with respect to the computation of the Closing Cash
Proceeds. In the event that the Purchaser and the Representative are unable to
resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) days after the Purchaser\'s
receipt of such Objection Notice, the Purchaser and the Representative shall
submit such remaining disagreements to Ernst and Young LLP or a 

nationally‑recognized valuation or consulting firm as is acceptable to the
Purchaser and the Representative (the "Valuation Firm").

(i) The Valuation Firm shall make a final and binding determination with
respect to the computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the
components thereof, to the extent such amounts are in dispute, in accordance
with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and on Exhibit
H. The Purchaser and the Representative shall cooperate with the Valuation
Firm during the term of its engagement and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Valuation Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements
with respect to the computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each
of the components thereof, as soon as practicable. The Valuation Firm shall
consider only those items and amounts in the Purchaser\'s and the
Representative\'s respective calculations of the Closing Cash Proceeds,
including each of the components thereof, that are identified as being items
and amounts to which the Purchaser and the Representative have been unable to
agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Valuation Firm may not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
party. The Valuation Firm\'s determination of the Closing Cash Proceeds,
including each of the components thereof, shall be based solely on written
materials submitted by the Purchaser and the Representative (i.e., not on
independent review) and on the definitions included herein. The determination
of the Valuation Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto
and shall not be subject to appeal or further review.

(j) The costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm in determining the Closing
Cash Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, shall be borne by the
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the
Unitholders and Optionholders), on the other hand, based upon the percentage
which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to
the amount actually contested by such party. For example, if the Purchaser
claims the Closing Cash Proceeds are one thousand dollars ($1,000) less than
the amount determined by the Representative, and the Representative contests
only five hundred dollars ($500) of the amount claimed by the Purchaser, and
if the Valuation Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the
Purchaser three hundred dollars ($300) of the five hundred dollars ($500)
contested, then the costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm will be allocated
sixty percent (60%) (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Representative (on behalf of the
Unitholders and Optionholders) and forty percent (40%) (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to
the Purchaser. Prior to the Valuation Firm\'s determination of Closing Cash
Proceeds, (i) the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Representative (on
behalf of the Unitholders and Optionholders), on the other hand, shall each
pay fifty percent (50%) of any retainer paid to the Valuation Firm and (ii)
during the engagement of the Valuation Firm, the Valuation Firm will bill
fifty percent (50%) of the total charges to each of the Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Unitholders and Optionholders),
on the other hand. In connection with the Valuation Firm\'s determination of
Closing Cash Proceeds, the Valuation Firm shall also determine, pursuant to
the terms of the first and second sentences of this Section 3.03(g), and
taking into account all fees and expenses already paid by each of Purchaser,
on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Unitholders and
Optionholders), on the other hand, as of the date of such determination, the
allocation of its fees and expenses between the Purchaser and the
Representative (on behalf of the Unitholders and Optionholders), which such
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

(k) Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Cash Proceeds, including
each of the components thereof, is finally determined pursuant to this Section
3.03:

(i) if the Closing Cash Proceeds as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 3.03 are less than the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds, then (A)
first, to the maximum extent, Purchaser shall offset against, and reduce, the
Excess Working Capital Balance, if any, by the amount of such deficiency
exceeds the Purchase Price Escrow Funds, 

and (B) second, if any such deficiency remains after the offset against the
Excess Working Capital Balance, if any, pursuant to this Section 3.03(g)(i)(A)
(such remaining deficiency, the "Purchaser Adjustment Amount"), then the
Purchaser and the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to: (A) pay to
the Purchaser from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds an amount equal
to the lesser of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds and the Purchaser
Adjustment Amount (provided that if the Purchaser Adjustment Amount is greater
than the amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds, the Unitholders
and Optionholders shall each pay to the Purchaser their respective Per Unit
portion of the amount by which the Purchaser Adjustment Amount exceeds the
Purchase Price Escrow Funds), and (B) pay to the Representative or to the
Paying Agent at the Representative\'s direction (on behalf of the Unitholders
and Optionholders) the amount (if any) by which the amount of the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Funds is greater than the Purchaser Adjustment Amount;
and

(ii) if the Closing Cash Proceeds as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 3.03 are greater than the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds (the amount
of such deficiency, the "Seller Adjustment Amount"), then (A) the Purchaser
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries
to, pay to the Representative or the Paying Agent at the Representative\'s
direction (on behalf of the Unitholders and Optionholders) the Seller
Adjustment Amount, and (B) the Purchaser and the Representative shall cause
the Escrow Agent to pay to the Representative or the Paying Agent at the
Representative\'s direction (on behalf of the Unitholders and Optionholders)
all of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds.

All payments to be made pursuant to this Section 3.03(h) (the "Purchase Price
Adjustments") shall include interest on the Purchaser Adjustment Amount or the
Seller Adjustment Amount, as applicable, at a rate per annum equal to the
prime rate of interest reported from time to time in The Wall Street Journal,
calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over three
hundred sixty (360), from the Closing Date to the date of payment. All
Purchase Price Adjustments, other than payments of stated interest, shall (x)
be treated by all parties for tax purposes as adjustments to the Enterprise
Value, to the extent permitted by Law, and (y) be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the Purchaser or
the Representative, as applicable, it being understood that any payment to the
Representative pursuant to this sentence is made for the benefit of the
Unitholders and the Purchaser shall have no further obligation with respect to
the Purchase Price Adjustment following delivery of the same in full to the
Representative. The payments described in Section 3.03(h) shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser and the Representative for any and all
claims arising under this Agreement with respect to this Section 3.03.

3.04 Earn‑Out.

(a) On or prior to October 31, 2017, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver
to Representative a statement (the "Capital Bookings Statement") setting forth
the Purchaser\'s calculation of Aggregate Capital Bookings, including the
components thereof, together with reasonable supporting documentation with
respect thereto; provided that, if the Purchaser fails to deliver the Capital
Bookings Statement together with reasonable supporting documentation on or
prior to October 31, 2017, then the Aggregate Capital Bookings shall be
conclusively deemed to be equal to the Target Capital Bookings (and such
determination shall be final, binding and nonappealable by the parties
hereto). The Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company)
shall (i) permit the Representative and its representatives to have reasonable
access at reasonable times and on reasonable notice to the books, records and
other documents (including work papers, schedules, financial statements,
memoranda, etc.) pertaining to or used 

in connection with the preparation of the Capital Bookings Statement and the
Purchaser\'s calculation of the Aggregate Capital Bookings and provide the
Representative with copies thereof (as reasonably requested by the
Representative and subject to the execution of customary work paper access
letters, if requested) and (ii) cause its personnel, employees and advisors
(including accountants) and representatives to cooperate reasonably with the
Representative and its representatives in connection with the
Representative\'s review of the Capital Bookings Statement. If the
Representative disagrees with any part of the Purchaser\'s calculation of the
Aggregate Capital Bookings as set forth on the Capital Bookings Statement, the
Representative shall, within sixty (60) days after the Representative\'s
receipt of the Capital Bookings Statement, notify the Purchaser in writing of
such disagreement by setting forth the Representative\'s calculation of the
Aggregate Capital Bookings, including each of the components thereof, and
describing in reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement (a "Capital
Bookings Objection Notice"). If a Capital Bookings Objection Notice is not
delivered to the Purchaser within such time period, then the Capital Bookings
Statement and Aggregate Capital Bookings as prepared by the Purchaser will be
final, binding and nonappealable by the parties hereto. If a Capital Bookings
Objection Notice is delivered to the Purchaser within such time period, then
the Purchaser and the Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
their disagreements with respect to the computation of the Aggregate Capital
Bookings. In the event that the Purchaser and the Representative are unable to
resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) days after the Purchaser\'s
receipt of such Capital Bookings Objection Notice, the Purchaser and the
Representative shall submit such remaining disagreements to the Valuation
Firm. The parties acknowledge and agree that the determination of the
Aggregate Capital Bookings shall be used solely for purposes of determining
the Earn‑Out Amount and for no other purposes hereunder.

(b) The Valuation Firm shall make a final and binding determination with
respect to the computation of the Aggregate Capital Bookings, including each
of the components thereof, to the extent such amounts are in dispute, in
accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and
on Exhibit H. The Purchaser and the Representative shall cooperate with the
Valuation Firm during the term of its engagement and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Valuation Firm to resolve all remaining
disagreements with respect to the computation of the Aggregate Capital
Bookings, including each of the components thereof, as soon as practicable.
The Valuation Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in the
Purchaser\'s and the Representative\'s respective calculations of the
Aggregate Capital Bookings, including each of the components thereof, that are
identified as being items and amounts to which the Purchaser and the
Representative have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the
Valuation Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. The Valuation Firm\'s determination of
the Aggregate Capital Bookings, including each of the components thereof,
shall be based solely on written materials submitted by the Purchaser and the
Representative (i.e., not on independent review) and on the definitions
included herein. The determination of the Valuation Firm shall be conclusive
and binding upon the parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or
further review.

(c) If the Aggregate Capital Bookings, as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 3.04, are greater than or equal to 85% of the Target Capital Bookings,
then, within five (5) Business Days after the Aggregate Capital Bookings are
finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.04, the Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries to, pay
the Earn‑Out Amount to the Representative or to the Paying Agent at the
Representative\'s direction (on behalf of the Unitholders and Optionholders).
If the Aggregate Capital Bookings, as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 3.04, are less than 85% of the Target Capital Bookings, then the
Purchaser shall not be required to pay any portion of the Earn‑Out Amount to
the Unitholders or Optionholders and this Section 3.04 shall terminate with no
further liability or obligation under this Section 3.04. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event of any Sale of the Company prior to the final
determination of the Aggregate Capital Bookings pursuant to this Section 3.04,
the maximum amount of the Earn‑Out Amount shall be automatically and
immediately due 

and payable immediately prior to, and as a condition of, a Sale of the
Business, and shall be paid to the Representative or to the Paying Agent at
the Representative\'s direction (on behalf of the Unitholders and
Optionholders). After the payment of the Earn‑Out Amount pursuant to this
Section 3.04(c), no further payments will be required under this Section 3.04
and this Section 3.04 shall terminate with no further liability or obligation
under this Section 3.04.

(d) The Surviving Company and the Purchaser covenant and agree that from the
Closing until the Earn‑Out Amount is paid or finally determined to not be
payable in accordance with this Section 3.04, (i) neither the Purchaser nor
any Affiliate of the Purchaser (including the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries) shall take any action (or omit to take any action) with the
intention of frustrating the achievement of the Target Capital Bookings during
the Measurement Year, including, without limitation, entering into any
transaction, however designated, which could reasonably be expected to reduce
the Capital Bookings for the Measurement Year or otherwise frustrate the
achievement of the Target Capital Bookings during the Measurement Year or
transferring any material contracts, diverting any new business or
arrangements from the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the
Purchaser or any other business unit or Affiliate of the Purchaser in a manner
that could reduce the Capital Bookings for the Measurement Year or otherwise
frustrate the achievement of the Target Capital Bookings during the
Measurement Year, and (ii) the Surviving Company shall maintain its books and
records in a manner adequate in all material respects to calculate Capital
Bookings for the Measurement Year in accordance with this Agreement.

(e) The payment of the Earn‑Out Amount, if any, pursuant to this Section 3.04
shall be treated by all parties for tax purposes as adjustments to the
Enterprise Value, to the extent permitted by Law.

and for the periods referred to therein; subject to, with respect to the
Interim Financial Statements only and as indicated therein or in the notes

Subsidiaries in the Financial Statements.

amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the Surviving Company\'s or
any of its Subsidiaries\' certificate or articles of formation or operating
agreement (or equivalent governing documents) relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of any officers, directors or similar functionaries (unless to
provide for greater exculpation or indemnification or unless required by Law),

Subsidiaries shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification (including with respect to advancement of expenses) to the
full extent contemplated by the Surviving Company\'s or any of its

or similar functionary of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Effective Time or any other party covered by directors\' and officers\'

Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 8.02 shall continue in effect
until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.

(e) The obligations under this Section 8.02 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to affect adversely any indemnitee or exculpee to
whom this Section 8.02 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee
or exculpee. The provisions of this Section 8.02 are intended for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by (as express third‑party beneficiaries), each
current and former officer, director or similar functionary of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and representatives, successors and
assigns and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have had by
contract or otherwise.

Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

8.06 Credit Support. From the date hereof until the Closing, Purchaser shall
take such actions as required to cause the full and unconditional release as

10.03 Employees and Employee Benefits.

(a) Salary and Wages. The Purchaser will cause the Company to continue the
employment effective immediately after the Closing Date of all employees of

disability, family or other leave of absence as of the Closing Date. All such
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed by the Company
and its Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing Date are referred to as
"Retained Employees". The Purchaser will cause the Company to provide each
such Retained Employee who remains employed with at least the same base wages,
annual base salary and annual rate of cash bonus potential (determined as a
percentage of annual base salary) (but excluding any equity plan program or
arrangement) provided to each such employee on the Closing Date for a period

nothing in this Section 10.03(a) shall obligate the Purchaser or the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any such Retained
Employee for any specific period.

(b) Employee Benefits. As of the Closing Date and for a period of at least one
(1) year thereafter, the Purchaser shall provide, or shall cause the Company
to provide, each Retained Employee with benefits (other than any equity based
compensation or participation in any defined benefit plan) that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the benefits provided to such
Retained Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.

Company\'s severance practices. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of
this Section 10.03, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company

consistent with the requirements set forth in the Severance Benefits Schedule
to Retained Employees whose employment with the Surviving Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is involuntarily terminated within twelve (12) months
following the Effective Time in amounts no less favorable than the amount of
severance benefits to which such persons would have been entitled under the
terms of the applicable Plan as in effect as of the Closing Date; provided,
that Purchaser may condition such Retained Employee\'s entitlement to such
severance benefits on such Retained Employee\'s execution of a reasonable
release of claims in favor of Purchaser, the Company, its Subsidiaries, the
Merger Sub, and their respective Affiliates.

(d) Employee Service Credit. The Purchaser (i) shall give, or cause the
Company to give, each Retained Employee credit under any benefit plan or
personnel policies that cover the Retained Employee after the Closing Date,
including any vacation, sick leave and severance policies, for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and entitlement to vacation, sick leave and severance
benefits for the Retained Employee\'s service with the Company and its
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date, to the same extent recognized by the
Company or its Subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof as of the Closing Date
(other than vesting under any incentive plan and accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan), (ii) shall allow such Retained Employees to participate
in each plan providing welfare benefits (including medical, life insurance,
long‑term disability insurance and long‑term care insurance) without regard to
preexisting‑condition limitations, waiting periods, evidence of insurability
or other exclusions or limitations not imposed on the Retained Employee by the
corresponding Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) if any
Welfare Plan is terminated prior to the end of the plan year that includes the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall credit the Retained Employee with any
expenses that were covered by such Welfare Plan(s) for purposes of determining
deductibles, co‑pays and other applicable limits under any similar replacement
plans.

(e) Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays. The Purchaser shall cause the Company
to continue to credit to each Retained Employee all vacation and personal
holiday pay that the Retained Employee is entitled to use but has not used as
of the Closing Date (including any earned vacation or personal holiday pay to
be used in future years), and shall assume all liability for the payment of
such amounts, to the extent accrued on the Financial Statements.

(f) No Third‑Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Section 10.03 are
solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or
former employee, officer, director or consultant, or any other individual
associated therewith, shall be regarded for any purpose as a third‑party
beneficiary of this Section 10.03. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify any Plan or any other
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by the
Company, the Purchaser, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Purchaser, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate
any Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon any current or former
employee, officer, director or consultant, any right to employment or
continued employment or continued service with the Purchaser, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or constitute or create an
employment agreement with any employee.

any Governmental Body challenging the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) The parties hereto commit to instruct their respective counsel to
cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to
facilitate and expedite the identification and resolution of any issues
arising under the HSR Act and any Other Antitrust Regulations at the earliest
practicable dates. Such commercially reasonable efforts and cooperation
include counsel\'s undertaking (i) to keep each other appropriately informed
of communications from and to personnel of the reviewing Governmental Bodies,
and (ii) to confer with each other regarding appropriate contacts with and
response to personnel of such Governmental Bodies and the content of any such

participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Body with
respect of any such filings, applications, investigation, or other inquiry
without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or discussion and,
to the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Body, the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meeting or discussion (which, at the reasonable
request of either the Purchaser or the Company, shall be limited to outside
antitrust counsel only). The Company and the Purchaser shall each approve the
content of any filings (as contemplated by Section 10.04(a)), material
communications, presentations, white papers or other written materials to be
submitted to any Governmental Body in advance of any such submission.

the SEC\'s Regulation S‑X, Rules 1‑02(w) and 3‑05 exceed 40%, the

thing relating to any Company Affiliate occurring or arising up until the
Closing, in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated, known or unknown, and whether arising under any agreement or
understanding or otherwise (except for (A) contractual rights of the
undersigned pursuant to this Agreement and any other certificate, document or
instrument executed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including without
limitation the Letter of Transmittal of such Unitholder or Optionholder, 

or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B)
indemnification of any current or former officer, director or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the organizational documents of the
Company or any of its Affiliates (and after the closing, of the Surviving
Company), or (C) any rights that arise after the Closing), (ii) agrees that
such Unitholder or Optionholder shall not seek to recover any amounts in
connection therewith or thereunder from the Company, the Purchaser, the Merger
Sub or any of the Company Affiliates and (ii) acknowledges that the terms of
this Section 11.02(y) are for the benefit of the Company Affiliates and shall
be enforceable by any of them directly against such Unitholder or
Optionholder; provided, however, that, in each case, the foregoing release
shall not apply to claims arising under or pursuant to and in accordance with
this Agreement against the parties to this Agreement, or claims arising under
or pursuant to and in accordance with the Letters of Transmittal or the Option
Cancellation Agreements against the applicable parties to such agreements.
Except for the Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.02(d), no Person (including the
Unitholders, the Optionholders, the Representative and their respective
Non‑Recourse Parties) shall have any obligation to fund the Indemnification
Escrow Account. The provisions in this Agreement relating to indemnification,
and the limits imposed on the Purchaser Indemnified Parties\' remedies with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
Section 11.01 and this Section 11.02) were specifically bargained for between
sophisticated parties and were specifically taken into account in the
determination of the amounts to be paid to the Unitholders and Optionholders
hereunder. No Purchaser Indemnified Party may avoid the limitations on
liability set forth in this Article XI by seeking damages for breach of
contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability. Nothing in this
Section 11.02 shall limit the rights of the Unitholders, the Optionholders or
the Representative to seek specific performance of the other parties\'
obligations hereunder in accordance with Section 13.18. Nothing in this
Section 11.02 shall limit a party\'s right to bring a claim for common law
fraud to the extent such fraud cannot be waived as a matter of Delaware public
policy with respect to contracts as contemplated by Abry Partners V, L.P. v.
FandW Acquisition LLC, 801 A.2d 1032 (Del. Ch. 2006).

11.03 Indemnification of the Seller Indemnified Parties. From and after the
Closing, the Unitholders, the Optionholders, the Representative and each of
their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees or agents
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") shall be indemnified by
Purchaser (subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of this Article
XI) against, and held harmless from, any and all Losses suffered or incurred
by any such Seller Indemnified Party to the extent arising from: (a) any
breach of, or any misrepresentation with respect to, any representation or
warranty expressly and specifically set forth in Article VI, and (b) any
nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant of the Purchaser, the Merger Sub or
the Surviving Company contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered
hereunder requiring performance after the Closing Date.

11.04 Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless a party in respect of a breach of representation or warranty or
covenant shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty or
covenant terminates pursuant to Section 11.07; provided, however, that such
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to
any item as to which an Indemnified Party shall have, prior to the expiration
of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a written
notice (stating in reasonable detail the nature of, and factual and legal
basis for, any such claim for indemnification, the amount thereof (if known
and quantifiable) and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim
for indemnification is made) to the Indemnifying Party.









11.05 Procedures Relating to Indemnification.

(a) In order for a Person (the "Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of a claim or
demand made by any non Affiliated Person against the Indemnified Party (a
"Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying
party (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing, and in reasonable detail
(including a description of the claim, the amount thereof (if known and
quantifiable) and the basis thereof and the provisions of this Agreement upon
which such claim for indemnification is made), of the Third Party Claim as
promptly as reasonably possible after receipt, but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days after receipt, by such Indemnified Party of notice of the
Third Party Claim; provided, that failure to give such notification on a
timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to
the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnifying Party, within five (5) Business Days after the Indemnified
Party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) It is the parties\' intention that, to the extent available, a Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall seek recourse pursuant to the CW Agreement prior to
seeking recourse against the Unitholders and Optionholders pursuant to this
Article XI. Accordingly, if a Purchaser Indemnified Party would, in its sole
but reasonable discretion, exercised in good faith and consistent with the
previous sentence, reasonably be entitled to seek recovery with respect to all
or any portion of a Third Party Claim pursuant to the CW Agreement (all or
such portion of such Third Party Claim, a "CW Claim"), then such Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall (i) contemporaneously with or prior to notifying the
applicable Indemnifying Party of such CW Claim, deliver a notice of such claim
to the applicable indemnifying parties under the CW Agreement and to the
Representative (provided that failure to give such notification on a timely
basis shall not affect the indemnification of the Indemnifying Party except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as
a result of such failure), (ii) notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third
Party Claim in accordance with Section 11.05(a), and (iii) pursue such CW
Claim until the same has been finally determined in accordance with the CW
Agreement, it being understood that (A) the Purchaser Indemnified Party\'s
notification to the Indemnified Party of the Third Party Claim as relates to
such CW Claim shall constitute notice to the Indemnified Party of the Third
Party Claim for purposes of this Section 11.05(a) and shall serve to toll the
survival period set forth in Section 11.07 solely with respect to such Third
Party Claim until the CW Claim has been finally determined in accordance with
the CW Agreement, (B) nothing in this Section 11.05(b) shall limit the
Purchaser Indemnified Party\'s ability to take any action it deems necessary
to preserve its claim against the Indemnified Party and (C) in no event shall
any Purchaser Indemnified Party be entitled to recover any amount under this
Article XI with respect to a CW Claim unless and until such CW Claim has been
finally determined in accordance with the CW Agreement.

(c) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to, at such Indemnifying Party\'s
expense, assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying
Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided, however,
that the Indemnifying Party may not assume and conduct the defense of such
Third Party Claim and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the Indemnified Party if (i) such Third Party Claim seeks
equitable relief, (ii) such Third Party Claim involves criminal or
quasi‑criminal allegations, (iii) such Third Party Claim involves a claim to
which the Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse determination would
have a material and adverse effect on the Indemnified Party\'s reputation or
future business prospects, (iv) such Third Party Claim involves a claim that,
upon petition by the Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules that the
Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend, (v)
such Third Party Claim involves a claim that is reasonably expected to result
in liability to the Indemnified Party in excess of the result of (A) the
then‑remaining Indemnification Escrow Funds as of such date minus 

(B) the sum of all Losses specified in any then unresolved indemnification
claims made by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article XI (including
the limitations herein), or (vi) the insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy
exercises a right to defend or control such Third‑Party Claim; provided,
further, however, such election will conclusively establish for purposes of
this Agreement that the Indemnified Party is entitled to relief under this
Agreement for any Loss arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection
with the Third‑Party Claim (subject to the provisions of this Article XI).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) regardless of whether a Seller Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of a Third‑Party Claim against a Purchaser
Indemnified Party, the Representative shall continue to be entitled to assert
any limitation on any claims made by any Purchaser Indemnified Party contained
in Sections 11.01 and 11.02 and (B) should an Indemnifying Party elect to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 11.05(b),
(x) the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party had not assumed the defense thereof, (y) the Indemnifying
Party shall not have the right to recover and be reimbursed from the
Indemnification Escrow Funds for any Losses of the Indemnifying Party incurred
in defending or settling such Third Party Claim, as applicable, and (z) the
amount of any Losses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in defending or
settling such Third Party Claim shall not be deemed to be Losses of, and
Losses recovered by, the Indemnified Party for purposes of determining whether
Losses otherwise recoverable by the Indemnified Parties would exceed the
Standard Matters Cap, the Special Matters Cap, the Groquip Cap, the Aggregate
Cap and/or a Unitholder\'s or Optionholder\'s Per Unit Portion of the
Enterprise Value, as applicable. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such
defense as provided in Section 11.05(b), the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it
being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such
defense subject to the terms Section 11.05(b). If the Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, all the parties hereto shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in the defense or prosecution of
such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the Indemnifying Party\'s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees and other representatives and advisors available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party
shall control the defense of any Third Party Claim as provided in Section
11.05(b), then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle such Third
Party Claim; provided, that, the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a
claim or ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed
against the Indemnified Party, such settlement does not expressly and
unconditionally release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such claim, without prejudice, such Indemnified
Party shall have to pay a portion of the settlement, or such settlement could
be reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect any Tax or other
liability of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company
post‑Closing).

11.06 Net Losses. The amount of any and all Losses under this Article XI shall
be determined net of (a) any Tax Benefits actually realized by any party
seeking indemnification hereunder arising from any such Losses in the year of
such Loss, any prior year and the two (2) years following the year of such
Loss, determined on a with‑ and without‑ basis, and (b) any amounts recovered
or recoverable by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies, indemnities
or other reimbursement arrangements with respect to such Losses, including for
the avoidance of doubt under the RandW Insurance Policy. If the Indemnified
Party receives a Tax Benefit after an indemnification payment is made to it
that was not taken into account at the time the indemnification payment was
made, the Indemnified Party shall within ten (10) days of receipt of such Tax
Benefit pay over to the Representative or to the Paying Agent at the
Representative\'s direction (on behalf of the Unitholders and Optionholders)
the amount of such Tax Benefit at such time or times as, and to the extent 

that, such Tax Benefit is actually realized by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek full
recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as
they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder (but,
for the avoidance of doubt, only after the amount of any deductibles,
retentions or similar costs have been satisfied and only the extent such
policies cover such Loss). In the event that an insurance, indemnification or
other recovery is made by any Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for
which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to
the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of the recovery actually received by
the Indemnified Party, net of any recovery costs, and (ii) the amount of the
indemnification payment previously received by the Indemnified Party pursuant
to Section 11.01 with respect to such Loss. Each party hereto waives, to the
extent permitted under its applicable insurance policies, any subrogation
rights that its insurer may have with respect to any indemnifiable Losses. Any
indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes.

11.07 Survival. The representations and warranties herein shall survive the
Closing solely for purposes of Section 11.01 and Section 11.03 until the close
of business on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date and
no claims may be brought with respect to such matters thereafter; provided,
however, that the Company Fundamental Representations shall survive until the
close of business on the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing
Date. Liability with respect to the matters set forth in (a) Section 11.01(ii)
shall survive until the close of business of the date that is ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, (b) Section 11.01(iii), Section 11.01(iv) and Section
11.01(v) shall survive until the close of business on the date that is
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, and (c) Section 11.01(vi) shall
survive until the close of business on the date that is twenty‑four (24)
months after the Closing Date; provided, however, that the indemnification
obligations of the Indemnifying Party hereunder shall not terminate with
respect to any pending claim timely filed in accordance with Section 11.01
until such claim is finally resolved. No claim for indemnification hereunder
for breach of any representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and other
provisions may be made after the expiration of the applicable survival period
set forth in this Section 11.07.

11.08 Manner of Payment or Satisfaction. Subject to, and in accordance with,
the provisions of this Article XI and the Escrow Agreement:

(a) Any indemnification of the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to this
Article XI shall be delivered by the Purchaser to the Representative or the
Paying Agent at the Representative\'s direction (on behalf of the Unitholders
and Optionholders) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the Representative within five (5) Business Days after
the determination thereof.

(b) Any Losses with respect to which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are
otherwise entitled to recover from a Unitholder or Optionholder pursuant to
the terms of, and subject to the limitations set forth in, this Article XI
shall first be reduced, to the maximum extent, pursuant to an offset against,
and deduction of, the Excess Working Capital Balance, if any. Any Losses with
respect to which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to recover
from a Unitholder or Optionholder pursuant to this Article XI after any such
reduction pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be delivered to
the Purchaser (i) first, from the Indemnification Escrow Funds in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Purchaser within five (5)
Business Days after the determination thereof; and (ii) second, to the extent
the sum of such Indemnification Escrow Funds are less than the indemnifiable
Loss pursuant to this Article XI, directly from the Unitholders and
Optionholders, severally and not jointly and in accordance with each such
Unitholder\'s or Optionholders\' Per Unit Portion of the Enterprise Value,
subject to the Standard Matters Cap, the Special Indemnity Cap, the Groquip
Cap and the Aggregate Cap, as applicable, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Purchaser within five (5)
Business Days after the determination thereof. 

ARTICLE XII

TAX MATTERS

12.01 Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.

(g) The Company shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries required to be filed (taking into account
extensions) prior to the Closing Date. Unless otherwise required by Law, none
of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall (or shall cause or permit any
other Person to) (i) except as otherwise provided in this Section 12.01,
amend, re‑file or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre‑Closing Tax
Period (or portion thereof); (ii) make any Tax election (including, but not
limited to, an election pursuant to Section 336 or 338 of the Code) that has
retroactive effect to any Pre‑Closing Tax Period (or portion thereof); (iii)
file any ruling or request with any taxing authority that relates to Taxes or
Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Pre‑Closing Tax
Period; or (iv) enter into any voluntary disclosure with any taxing authority
regarding any Tax or Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
a Pre‑Closing Tax Period (including any voluntary disclosure with a taxing
authority with respect to filing Tax Returns or paying Taxes for a Pre‑Closing
Tax Period in a jurisdiction that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries did
not previously file a Tax Return or pay Taxes), in each case, without the
prior written consent of the Representative, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed if and to the extent such action (i) could have an
effect on the amount of Pre‑Closing Tax Refunds or Transaction Tax Deductions
Benefits to be paid over to the Representative pursuant to Section 12.03 or
(ii) could result in any Taxes for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may
be indemnified pursuant to Section 11.01.

(h) Subject to Section 12.01(c), the Purchaser shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and timely file, or cause to be filed, all other Tax Returns with
respect to the Company (or the Surviving Company) or any Subsidiary thereof.
The Purchaser shall make, or cause to be made, all payments required with
respect to any such Tax Returns.

(i) Any Tax Return to be prepared and filed after the Closing Date for taxable
periods beginning before the Closing Date shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with the last previous similar Tax Return to the extent permissible
under applicable Law. Any net operating loss or tax credit shall be carried
back to the earliest taxable period permitted by Law. Each of the parties
hereto agree that the Transaction Tax Deductions shall be allocated to the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date or the pre‑Closing portion of the
Straddle Period, as applicable, and included in the United States federal
income Tax Return filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the
taxable year ending on the Closing Date to the fullest extent allowable by
Law. The party preparing each such Tax Return shall consult with the
Representative concerning such Tax Return in good faith. The party preparing
each such Tax Return shall provide the Representative with a copy of such
proposed Tax Return (and such additional information regarding such Tax Return
as may reasonably be requested by the Representative) at least forty five (45)
days prior to the filing of such Tax Return, except that in the case of a Tax
Return due within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the copy shall
be provided to the Representative within ten (10) days prior to the filing.
The Purchaser shall consider in good faith any comments of the Representative
to such Tax Returns, and shall not file any such Tax Returns without
Representative\'s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The Purchaser and the Representative shall use good
faith efforts to resolve any dispute regarding the preparation of Tax Returns
after the Closing Date for Tax periods beginning before the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties agree that the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall elect to terminate the use of the LIFO
method of tax accounting in their taxable year ended June 30, 2016 (the "LIFO
Termination Election"). 

(j) In connection with the preparation of the first Income Tax Return for a
Pre-Closing Period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be filed after
the Closing Date, the party preparing such Income Tax Return shall provide the
Representative along with the draft of such proposed Tax Return pursuant to
Section 12.01(c) with a proposed calculation of the Transaction Tax Benefit
Deductible (including the elements of the definition of Transaction Tax
Deductions which shall be deductible for federal Income Tax purposes). The
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to finalize the Transaction Tax Benefit
Deductible. The Transaction Tax Benefit Deductible shall be updated for the
amount of any Transaction Tax Deductions to the extent not included as
deductions in Income Tax Returns of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries
for a taxable period or portion thereof that ends on the Closing Date.

12.02 Allocation of Certain Taxes.

(d) If the Company or the Surviving Company is permitted, but not required,
under applicable foreign, state or local Income Tax Laws to treat the Closing
Date as the last day of a taxable period, such day shall be treated as the
last day of a taxable period.

(e) Any Taxes for a taxable period beginning before the Closing Date and
ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") based on or measured by
income, receipts, or payroll of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
Pre‑Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period of any partnership or other pass‑through entity in which
Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed
to terminate at such time) and the amount of other Taxes of Company and its
Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre‑Closing Tax Period
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such Straddle Period.

12.03 Tax Refunds and Transaction Tax Deduction Benefits.

(a) Any refunds of Taxes (including, without limitation, estimated Taxes) with
respect to any taxable period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ending
on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing
Date for any Straddle Period that are received by the Purchaser, the Surviving
Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries after the Closing Date, net
of all out-of-pocket costs (including Taxes) imposed on or incurred by
Purchaser, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (any
such refund, a "Pre‑Closing Tax Refund"), shall be for the account of the
Unitholders and the Optionholder or the Purchaser as provided in Section
12.03(c). The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and their
respective Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to maximize any
Pre‑Closing Tax Refunds, and shall cooperate with the Representative (on
behalf of, and at the sole expense of, the Unitholders and the Optionholders)
in obtaining such Pre‑Closing Tax Refunds, including through the filing of
amended Tax Returns or refund claims, it being understood that (i) all such
refunds shall be claimed in cash rather than as a credit against future Tax
liabilities, and (ii) at the election of the Representative, the Purchaser,
the Surviving Company and the Surviving Company\'s Subsidiaries will carry
back any net operating losses for taxable periods ending on or before or
including the Closing Date to prior taxable periods as allowable by applicable
Tax Law and shall claim Tax refunds as a result of such carryback.

(b) Any Transaction Tax Deduction Benefit (as defined below) realized with
respect to each taxable year (or portion thereof) beginning on or after the
Closing Date shall be for the account of the Unitholders and the Optionholders
or the Purchaser as provided in Section 12.03(c). For this purpose, a
"Transaction Tax Deduction Benefit" means the amount of any reduction in the
Purchaser\'s (including any group with which the Purchaser files Tax Returns
on a consolidated, combined or similar basis), the Surviving 

Company\'s, or any of their respective Subsidiaries\' liability for Taxes
resulting from (i) the carryforward of any net operating loss of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries arising in a taxable period or portion thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date or (ii) any Transaction Tax Deductions to
the extent not included as deductions in the Tax Returns of the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries for a taxable period or portion thereof that ends on the
Closing Date. A Transaction Tax Deduction Benefit shall be deemed to be
realized in a taxable year (or portion thereof) if, and only to the extent
that, the Purchaser\'s (including any group with which the Purchaser files Tax
Returns on a consolidated, combined or similar basis), the Surviving
Company\'s, or any of their respective Subsidiaries\' liability for Taxes for
such taxable year, calculated by excluding such net operating loss
carryforward and/or such Transaction Tax Deduction, exceeds such Person\'s
actual liability for Taxes for such taxable year (or portion thereof),
calculated by taking into account such net operating loss carryforward and/or
such Transaction Tax Deduction. A Transaction Tax Deduction Benefit shall be
deemed to be realized when the applicable person\'s actual Tax payment for
such taxable year (or portion thereof) is reduced (as calculated pursuant to
the previous sentence), including, for the avoidance of doubt, upon the
payment of any reduced extension payment. In connection with the payment of
any Transaction Tax Deduction Benefit and within ten (10) of filing the final
Tax Return for a taxable year, the Purchaser shall provide to the
Representative a calculation (and accompanying analysis and workpapers) of the
Transaction Tax Deduction Benefit for such taxable year (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date prepared by the accounting firm responsible
for preparing its Tax Returns.

(c) The benefit of any Transaction Tax Deductions (including in the form of a
reduction in pre-closing income Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries),
Pre-Closing Tax Refunds, and/or Transaction Tax Deduction Benefits shall be
for the account of the Unitholders and the Optionholders, on the one hand, and
of the Purchaser, on the other hand, as follows (it being understood that the
benefit of any Transaction Tax Deductions in form of a reduction in pre-
closing income Taxes shall be deemed allocated first):

(iii) First, to the Purchaser up to the amount of any Indemnified Taxes not in
excess of the Transaction Tax Benefit Deductible;

(iv) Second, to the Unitholders and the Optionholders up to the amount of any
indemnification paid to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section
11.01(v);

(v) Third, to the Purchaser up to the amount of the LIFO Tax Liability; and

(vi) Fourth, fifty percent (50%) to the Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) to
the Unitholders and the Optionholders.

(d) The Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company or one or more
of its Subsidiaries to, pay to the Representative or to the Paying Agent at
the Representative's direction (on behalf of the Unitholders and the
Optionholders) the amount of any Pre-Closing Tax Refund and/or Transaction Tax
Deduction Benefit that is for the account of the Unitholders and the
Optionholders as determined pursuant to Section 12.03(c) within ten (10) days
after receipt thereof.

(e) The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and their
respective Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to maximize
any Pre-Closing Tax Refund and/or Transaction Tax Deduction Benefits, which
efforts shall include maximizing the "Section 382 limitation" with respect to
the carryforward of any net operating loss of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(including applying the "section 338 approach" pursuant to Notice 2003‑65,
2003‑2 C.B. 747).

(f) The payment of the any Pre-Closing Tax Refund and/or Transaction Tax
Benefits, if any, pursuant to this Section 12.03 shall be treated by all
parties for tax purposes as adjustments to the Enterprise Value, to the extent
permitted by Law. 

12.04 Transfer Taxes. At the Closing or, if due thereafter, promptly when due,
all gross receipts, transfer Taxes, gains Taxes, real property transfer Taxes,
sales Taxes, use Taxes, excise Taxes, stamp Taxes, conveyance Taxes and any
other similar Taxes applicable to, arising out of or imposed upon the
transactions contemplated hereunder shall be paid, or caused to be paid, by
the Representative (on behalf of the Unitholders). The Representative shall
prepare any Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes, and the Purchaser shall
cooperate with the Representative in the preparation of such Tax Returns.

12.05 Cooperation on Tax Matters.

(a) The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the
Unitholders and Optionholders), on the other hand, and their respective
Affiliates shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other party, in (i) the preparation of all Tax Returns pursuant to this
Article XII and (ii) the conduct of any Tax Proceeding, for which one (1)
party could reasonably require the assistance of the other party in obtaining
any necessary information. Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited
to, the retention and (upon the other party\'s request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Such cooperation and information also shall
include promptly forwarding copies of appropriate notices and forms or other
communications received from or sent to any Governmental Body which relate to
the Surviving Company, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and providing
copies of all relevant Tax Returns, together with accompanying schedules and
related workpapers, documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
any Governmental Body and records concerning the ownership and tax basis of
property, which the requested party may possess.

(b) At its election, the Representative shall control at its expense any Tax
Proceeding (i) for which the Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Company or
any of the Subsidiaries may be indemnified pursuant to Section 11.01 or (ii)
to the extent such Tax Proceeding relates to a Pre‑Closing Tax Period of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Purchaser shall control all other Tax
Proceedings with respect to the Surviving Company, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax Proceeding
relating to the Straddle Period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries).
The Representative shall consult with the Purchaser regarding any Tax
Proceeding it controls with respect to the Surviving Company, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, provide the Purchaser with information and documents
related thereto, permit the Purchaser or its representative to attend any such
Tax Proceeding, and not settle any such issue without the consent of the
Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). In the event that the Representative does not elect to control a Tax
Proceeding for which the Purchaser could assert a claim pursuant to Section
11.01 or such Tax Proceeding is related to a Straddle Period of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, the Purchaser shall consult with the Representative
regarding any Tax Proceeding with respect to the Surviving Company, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that includes any item the adjustment of
which would cause any Unitholder or Optionholder to become obligated to make
any payment pursuant to Section 11.01, provide the Representative with
information and documents related thereto, permit the Representative or his
representative to attend any such Tax Proceeding, and not settle any such
issue without the consent of the Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For the avoidance of doubt, to
the extent the provisions of this Section 12.04(b) conflict with the
provisions of Section 11.05, the provisions of this Section 12.04(b) shall
prevail.





12.06 Termination of Tax‑Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or
similar arrangements with respect to or involving the Company and its
Subsidiaries (other than any agreement entered into in the ordinary course of
business and not primarily concerning Taxes) shall be terminated prior to the
Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company shall not be bound
thereby or have any liability thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods
ending on or before the Closing Date.

12.07 No Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter. The Purchaser shall not take
any action or cause any action to be taken with respect to the Company or the
Surviving Company subsequent to the Closing that would cause the transactions
contemplated hereby to constitute part of a transaction that is the same as,
or substantially similar to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter"
described in Internal Revenue Service Notice 2001‑16, 2001 1 C.B. 730, and

Surviving Company, on the other hand.

discretion).

be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

13.06 Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The
headings of the sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have been inserted
for convenience of reference only and shall in no way restrict or otherwise
modify any of the terms or provisions hereof. In the event a subject matter is
addressed in more than one (1) representation and warranty in Article V, the
Purchaser and the Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely only on the most
specific representation and warranty addressing such matter. The specification
of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits
is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the
items so included, or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed
(including whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or are within or outside of the Ordinary Course of
Business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the
fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules,
or exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the parties hereto as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not set forth or included in this

as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the Ordinary Course of
Business for purposes of this Agreement. In addition, matters reflected in the

are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include
other matters of a similar nature. The information contained in this
Agreement, in the Disclosure Schedules, and exhibits hereto is disclosed
solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or
therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any
third‑party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach
of contract).

13.07 Amendment and Waiver. Except as provided herein, any provision of this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits hereto may be amended or
waived only in a writing signed by the Purchaser, the Company and the

thereof shall extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or
subsequent breach or default.

13.08 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements,
instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection
herewith contain the complete agreement 

between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings, agreements
or representations by or between the parties hereto, written or oral, which

Company or the Merger Sub). The provisions of this Agreement are intended for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Representative for the benefit
of, the Unitholders and Optionholders, and the Representative shall have the

functionaries of the Company and its Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and
representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

13.10 Counterparts. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument
entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or
thereto, may be executed in one (1) or more counterparts, all of which shall
constitute one and the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to the extent
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or
similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic
Delivery") shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed
counterpart and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as
if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto, each other party hereto or thereto shall re
execute the original form of this Agreement and deliver such form to all other
parties hereto. No party hereto shall raise the use of Electronic Delivery to
deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument
was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic Delivery as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party forever waives any
such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.

13.11 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. All issues and questions concerning the
construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement
and the exhibits and schedules hereto, and all claims and disputes arising
hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, whether

governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Law rules
or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware. The parties hereto hereby agree and consent to be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or, to the extent such court declines jurisdiction, first to any
federal court, or second, to any state court, each located in Wilmington,
Delaware, and hereby waive the right to assert the lack of personal or subject
matter jurisdiction or improper venue in connection with any such suit, action
or other proceeding. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties
hereto (a) waives the defense of inconvenient forum, (b) agrees not to
commence any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or
any transactions contemplated hereby other than in any such court, and (c)
agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or other proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit or
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION, ACTION,
PROCEEDING, CROSS‑CLAIM, OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY COURT (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT, OR 

OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH (i) THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE VALIDITY, PERFORMANCE, INTERPRETATION, COLLECTION OR
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR (ii) THE ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
AUTHORIZATION, EXECUTION, DELIVERY, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF.

Schedule) and such consents have not been obtained. The Purchaser agrees and
acknowledges that neither the Unitholders (including the Representative) nor
the Optionholders shall have any liability whatsoever to the Purchaser (or,
after the Closing, the Surviving Company) (and the Purchaser, or after the
Closing, the Surviving Company, shall not be entitled to assert any claims)
arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents that may have
been or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or because of the default, acceleration or termination of any
such contract, lease, license or other agreement as a result thereof and that
nothing in this Agreement shall require the Representative, the Unitholders,
the Optionholders, the Company or its Subsidiaries to expend any money or
incur any fees or liabilities to obtain any such consent. The Purchaser
further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of the Company
contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached and no condition of the
Purchaser or the Merger Sub shall be deemed not to be satisfied as a result of
the failure to obtain any consent or as a result of any such default,
acceleration or termination or any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or
investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising
out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consent or any such default,
acceleration or termination.

(i) to consummate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the
other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed

for the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment of Closing Cash Proceeds
contemplated by Section 3.03 and claims for indemnification under Article XI),
(iii) to receive and disburse to, or caused to be received or disbursed to,

Representative in the performance of any of their commitments hereunder
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the satisfaction of payment

with the adjustment of Closing Cash Proceeds contemplated by Section 3.03 or
the indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under Article XI),

determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement.

harmless and reimbursed by each Unitholder and Optionholder severally (based
on each Unitholder\'s and Optionholder\'s Indemnity Allocation Percentage),

fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid or incurred by the Representative and
its Non‑Recourse Parties in connection with any claim, action, suit or
proceeding to which the Representative or such other Person is made a party by
reason of the fact that it is or was acting as the Representative pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
satisfaction of payment obligations (on behalf of the Unitholders and
Optionholders) in connection with the adjustment of Closing Cash Proceeds
contemplated by Section 3.03 or the indemnification of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties under Article XI). Any and all amounts paid or incurred by

action, suit or proceeding to which the Representative or such other Person is

any liability to any Unitholder or Optionholder by virtue of the failure or
refusal of the Representative or any of its Non‑Recourse Parties for any
reason to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the
performance of their duties hereunder. The Representative and its Non‑Recourse
Parties shall have no liability in respect of any action, claim or proceeding
brought against any such Person by any Unitholder or Optionholder, regardless
of the legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to
be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in
equity, or otherwise, if any such Person took or omitted taking any action in
good faith.

(d) If the Representative pays or causes to be paid any amounts (on behalf of
the Unitholders and Optionholders) in connection with any obligation or
liability of a Unitholder or Optionholder in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment of
Closing Cash Proceeds contemplated by Section 3.03, the indemnification of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties under Article XI or the payment of the Earn‑Out
Amount (if any) pursuant to Section 3.04), any such payments and the
reasonable expenses of the Representative incurred in administering or
defending the underlying dispute or claim may be reimbursed, when and as

from the Representative Holdback Amount, the Representative shall be
indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed by each Unitholder and Optionholder
severally (based on each Unitholder\'s and Optionholder\'s Indemnity
Allocation Percentage), and not jointly, for such amount(s)). The
Representative may, in its sole and absolute discretion, distribute, or caused
to be distributed, any or all of the funds received or held by it on behalf of
the Unitholders and Optionholders (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
portion of the Merger Consideration) to one or more Unitholders or
Optionholders at any time after the date hereof, which such distribution(s) of
funds may be different (i.e., with respect to amount, timing, conditionality
or otherwise) for each Unitholder and Optionholder. Upon full reimbursement of
all expenses, costs, obligations or liabilities incurred by the Representative
in the performance of its duties hereunder, the Representative shall

Optionholders.

given or executed by the Purchaser or the Merger Sub or the Surviving Company.

their respective Affiliates in any matter related to the transaction completed

contemplated hereby, KandE LLP may serve as counsel to each and any of the
Representative, the Unitholders, the Optionholders and their respective

Surviving Company), together with any of their respective Affiliates,
successors or assigns, agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the
Privileged Communications in any action or claim against or involving any of
the parties hereto or any of their respective Non‑Recourse Parties after the

in contract or tort, or at law or in equity, or otherwise.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or otherwise, the parties
to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates that no Non‑Recourse Party of a party to this
Agreement shall have any liability relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated herein except to the extent agreed to in writing by
such Non‑Recourse Party.

13.16 Deliveries to the Purchaser. The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that
all documents or other items delivered in writing (including by electronic
mail) to the Purchaser or its representatives in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or uploaded and made available in
the Virtual Data Room on or before the date that is one (1) Business Day prior
to the date hereof and remain available for viewing on the date hereof shall
be deemed to have been delivered, provided or made available to the Purchaser,
the Merger Sub or their representatives for all purposes hereunder.

13.17 Conflict Between Transaction Documents. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby,
this Agreement shall govern and control.

13.18 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages or legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for
any such damages. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed that each party shall be
entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of any other
party, in any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive
relief shall be granted in connection therewith. Any party seeking an
injunction, a decree or order of specific performance shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection therewith and any such remedy
shall be in addition and not in substitution for any other remedy to which
such party is entitled at law or in equity.

13.19 Relationship of the Parties. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to constitute the parties hereto as joint venturers, alter egos, partners or
participants in an unincorporated business or other separate entity, nor,
except as expressly and specifically set forth in Section 13.12, in any manner
create 

any principal‑agent, fiduciary or other special relationship between the
parties hereto. No party shall have any duties (including fiduciary duties)
towards any other party hereto except as specifically set forth herein.
