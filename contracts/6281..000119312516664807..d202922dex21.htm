ARTICLE I. __

 

 _THE MERGER_

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
valid waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance
with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company (the " _Merger_ "), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub
will cease, with the Company surviving the Merger and continuing under the
name Linear Technology Corporation (the Company, as the surviving entity in
the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the " _Surviving
Corporation_ "), such that following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation
will be a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent. The Merger shall have the
effects provided in this Agreement and as specified in the DGCL.

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd
Street, New York, New York at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second
Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted) of the
last of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied or waived
(other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
action taken at or immediately prior to the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted) waiver of such conditions at the
Closing), unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the Company
and Parent. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as
the " _Closing Date_."

 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Parties shall cause a
certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be duly executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary_ ") as provided under the DGCL
and make any other filings, recordings or publications required to be made by
the Company, Merger Sub or Parent under the DGCL in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary or on such other date and
time as shall be agreed to by the Company and Parent and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (such date and time being hereinafter referred to as the
" _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as
provided under the DGCL.

 



\- 2 - Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of
such certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

Section 1.6 _Officers and Directors_ _of the Surviving Corporation_. Subject
to applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and
shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation, and shall hold office until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation
or removal.

ARTICLE II. _ _

_CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 2.1 _E_ _f_ _f_ _ec_ _t_ ___on_ ___Ca_ _pi_ _tal_ _ _ _S_ _to_ _c_
_k_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any of the Parties or the holder of any shares of Company Common
Stock or common stock of Merger Sub:

(i) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, subject to
_Section 2.1(b)_ and less any applicable withholding Tax, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Cancelled Shares, any Converted Shares, any Dissenting
Shares and any shares subject to a Company Restricted Stock Award) shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive the following consideration
(collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest: (A) $46.00
in cash (as may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ , the " _Cash
Consideration_ ") and (B) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (as
may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ ) (the " _Stock
Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock (including all uncertificated shares of Company Common
Stock represented by book-entry form (" _B_ _ook_ _-_ _Ent_ _r_ _y_ ___S_ _h_
_a_ _r_ _e_ _s_ ") and each certificate that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_C_ _er_ _ti_ _f_ _i_ _ca_ _t_ _e_ ")) shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
applicable holder of such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (including the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_
, the Fractional Share Cash Amount and dividends pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_
, if any) upon the surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 2.2_ , together with the amounts, if any, payable
pursuant to  _Section 2.2(e)_.

(ii) _Adjustments_. If the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued in connection with the Merger (including all shares of Parent
Common Stock which may be issued after the Effective Time pursuant to Adjusted
RSU

 



\- 3 -  Awards or Adjusted Restricted Stock Awards) would exceed 19.9% of the issued
and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Maximum Share Number_ "), (A) the Exchange Ratio shall
be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (rounded down to the nearest one
thousandth) such that the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued in connection with the Merger (including all shares of Parent
Common Stock which may be issued after the Effective Time pursuant to Adjusted
RSU Awards and Adjusted Restricted Stock Awards) does not exceed the Maximum
Share Number (such reduction, the " _Exchange Ratio Reduction Amount_ ") and
(B) the Cash Consideration for all purposes under this Agreement will be
increased on a per share basis by an amount equal to the Parent Signing
Trading Price multiplied by the difference between the initial Exchange Ratio
and the Exchange Ratio as determined in accordance with this _Section
2.1(a)(ii)_ (rounded down to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent). For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ shall be deemed to
limit or impair any right of Parent to invoke the failure of any condition
set forth in _Article VI_ of this Agreement, or to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VII_ of this Agreement if Parent would otherwise have
such right under  _Article VI_ or _Article VII_ , respectively.

(iii) _C_ _a_ _n_ _ce_ _ll_ _a_ _tion of_ ___Company Common_ ___S_ _to_ _c_
_k; Certain Subsidiary Owned Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
or held in treasury by the Company and each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
by Parent or Merger Sub shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist (the " _C_ _a_ _n_ _c_ _e_ _ll_ _e_ _d_
_S_ _h_ _are_ _s_ "), and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other
than Merger Sub) (the " _Converted Shares_ ") shall be converted into such
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each
such Subsidiarys ownership percentage in the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time is the same as such Subsidiarys
ownership percentage in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
(after taking into account the conversion of Merger Sub common stock pursuant
to _Section 2.1(a)(iv)_ ).

 

(iv) _Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each
issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall
(together with any Converted Shares converted into shares (or fractional
shares) of common stock of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_ ) constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _S_ _h_ _are_ _s of_ ___Diss_ _e_ _nti_ _n_ _g_ _ _ _S_ _to_ _c_ _khold_
_er_ _s_. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, shares
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder of record who did not vote in favor of
the approval and adoption of this Agreement (or consent thereto in writing)
and is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant 

 



\- 4 -  to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _DGCL
262_ " and any such shares meeting the requirement of this sentence, "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, but instead at the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive payment of such amounts as are payable in accordance
with DGCL 262 (it being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective
Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive
the fair market value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent afforded by DGCL
262); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that if any such holder (including any holder
of Proposed Dissenting Shares) shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the fair market value of such
Dissenting Shares under DGCL 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair market value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to
receive, without interest or duplication, the Merger Consideration. "
_Proposed Dissenting Shares_ " means shares of Company Common Stock whose
holders provide demands for fair market value to the Company prior to the
Company Stockholder Meeting and do not vote in favor of the approval and
adoption of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with DGCL 262. The
Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for fair market value of any Company Shares, of any withdrawals of
such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company relating to DGCL 262 and any alleged dissenters
rights, and Parent shall have the opportunity, at Parents expense, to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree
to do any of the foregoing.

(c) _C_ _er_ _t_ _a_ _in Adjustm_ _e_ _nts_. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number
of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, stock split, reverse stock split, combination
or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
proportionally reflect such change;  _p_ _r_ _ovid_ _e_ _d_ that nothing in
this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 

(d) _No_ _F_ _r_ _ac_ _tion_ _a_ _l_ _S_ _h_ _are_ _s_. No fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be delivered upon the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)(_ _i_ _)_ , and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of shares
of Parent Common Stock. In lieu of fractional shares, each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to receive as a
result of the Merger a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying (i)
the Parent Closing Trading Price, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a
cent by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares
of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded
to the nearest

 



\- 5 -  one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled (the " _Fractional Share Cash
Amount_ "). No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or
any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock
that would otherwise have been issuable as part of the Merger Consideration.

 

Section 2.2 _E_ _x_ _c_ _h_ _a_ _n_ _ge_ ___of C_ _er_ _t_ _i_ _f_ _i_ _c_
_at_ _e_ _s_.

(a) _Appointm_ _e_ _nt of_ _ _ _E_ _x_ _c_ _h_ _a_ _nge_ ___A_ _g_ _e_ _nt_.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Parents transfer agent as
exchange agent or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as exchange agent (the " _E_ _x_ _c_ _h_ _a_ _nge_ ___A_ _g_

Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
and Parent that any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Until

shares of Company Common Stock that have a record date prior to the Effective
Time and a payment date after the Effective Time, such payment to be made to
the holders of Company Common Stock on such record date.

Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_ ,
subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to _Section
2.2(g)_ , Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends and
distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Award is not an Interim Award, such adjusted award shall be in the form of (A)

is provided for pursuant to any Contract with the holder thereof, and, in each
case, be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than 10
Business Days thereafter), the Merger Consideration in respect of each share
of Company Common Stock underlying such vested Company Restricted Stock
Award, less applicable Tax withholding, or (ii) if such

vesting) as were applicable to the corresponding Company Restricted Stock
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that: (x) if the Company

into account any vesting acceleration that occurs at or prior to the Effective
Time) and (2) the Cash Consideration, and (B) a Parent restricted stock award
(an " _Adjusted Restricted Stock Award_ ") relating to a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number

unvested Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time (after taking into account any vesting acceleration that occurs at or
prior to the Effective Time) and (2) the Exchange Ratio; and (y) if the
Company Restricted Stock Award is an Interim Award, an Adjusted Restricted
Stock Award relating to that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product (rounded to the nearest whole number of shares) of (1) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the unvested Company Restricted
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (after taking into account any
vesting acceleration that occurs at or prior to the Effective Time), and (2)
the Interim Award Exchange Ratio.

 

(c) For purposes of clarity, and except as expressly set forth in _Section
2.3(a)_ , each Adjusted Cash Award, Adjusted RSU Award and Adjusted
Restricted Stock Award shall have the same terms and conditions as the Company
RSU Award or Company Restricted Stock Award it replaced, including the vesting
schedule, rights to acceleration, and, solely with respect to Adjusted
Restricted Stock Awards, any rights to receive future dividends in respect of
the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Adjusted Restricted Stock
Award.

appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions and shall take all such
other actions as are reasonably necessary to effectuate the treatment of the

been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement,
side letter or other arrangement relating to the Financing under the
Commitment Letter (excluding any agreement, letter or arrangement relating to
any potential permanent, replacement or alternative financing) __other
than the Commitment Letter and any related fee letters provided to the
Company under this _Section 4.12_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent
has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other
fees and amounts that are due and payable in connection with the Financing
under the Commitment Letter prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the
date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would reasonably 

 



\- 43 - constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent or, to the knowledge of
Parent, any other party thereto under the Commitment Letter that could result
in any portion of the Financing to be unavailable. As of the date of this
Agreement, assuming the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects and
the performance of all obligations and compliance with all covenants and
agreements required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with at or
prior to the Closing by the Company in all material respects, Parent has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing under the
Commitment Letter will not be satisfied on the Closing Date or that the
Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. Assuming
the Financing is funded in accordance with the Commitment Letter, Parent will
have at Closing all funds necessary to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby and pay the fees and expenses of Parent due
on the Closing Date (including after giving effect to any original issue
discount amounts and the exercise of any "flex" rights with respect thereto).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) in no event
shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by Parent or any
of its Affiliates be a condition to any of Parent or Merger Subs obligations
hereunder and (ii) it is understood and agreed that a breach of the
representations and warranties contained in this _Section 4.12_ shall not
result in the failure of a condition precedent to the Companys obligations
under this Agreement if, notwithstanding such breach, Parent and Merger Sub
are willing and able to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms hereof.

Section 4.13 _Merger Sub_. Parent is the sole stockholder of Merger Sub.
Since its date of incorporation, Merger Sub has not carried on any business
nor conducted any operations other than the execution of this Agreement, the
performance of its obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto.

 

Section 4.14 _State Takeover Statutes_. Assuming the accuracy of the Companys
representations in _Section 3.23_ , the Parent Board of Directors has taken
all action necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) all potentially
applicable state anti-takeover statutes or regulations and any
similar provisions in the Parent Articles or Parent By-laws.

Section 4.15 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. As of and for the
three years prior to the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries beneficially owns or owned, directly or indirectly, any
shares of Company Common Stock or other securities convertible into,
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock. There
are no voting trusts or other agreements or understanding to which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the capital
stock or other equity interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

person to this _Section 5.4_ , and provided, that the Company and its
Representatives may make inquiries of a person making an unsolicited Company
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) to ascertain facts regarding such
Company Takeover Proposal for the sole purpose of the Company Board of
Directors informing itself about such Company Takeover Proposal and the person
making it, but in each case limiting its communication exclusively to such
referral and such ascertaining of facts), or (C) approve, adopt, recommend or
enter into, or propose to approve, adopt, recommend or enter into, any letter

affiliates not to, release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant permission under, or fail to enforce, any standstill

party; _provided_ that, with respect to any person that did not submit an
indication of interest or bid to acquire the Company during the period
between March 1, 2016 and the date of this Agreement, if the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, the
Company may waive any such standstill provision applicable to any such persons
solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make a confidential
Company Takeover Proposal to the Company Board of Directors.

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly request
any person that has executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement in
connection with any actual or potential Company Takeover Proposal that remains

Representatives receives a bona fide unsolicited written Company
Takeover Proposal from any person that did not result from a breach by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives of this _Section
5.4_ and if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, then the Company and its
Representatives may, (i) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the person who has made such Company Takeover
Proposal and its Representatives; _provided_ that the Company shall
substantially concurrently with the delivery to such person provide or make

of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or
its Representatives unless such non-public information has been previously
provided or made available to Parent and (ii) engage in or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Company
Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding such Company Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within forty-eight

to lead to a Company Superior Proposal or if the Company furnishes non-public
information and/or enters into discussions or negotiations as provided in this
_Section 5.4(c)_.

 



\- 51 - (d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in no
event later than forty-eight hours after, to the knowledge of the Company or
its financial advisor, its receipt) notify Parent in writing in the event that
the Company or any of its Representatives receives a Company Takeover Proposal

the financial or other material terms of any such Company Takeover Proposal,
inquiry or request. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not
enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent

of Directors shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus when disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly
propose or announce an intention to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, in either case, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation or (C) adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of the
Company, or publicly propose or announce its intention to adopt, approve or
recommend to stockholders of the Company, a Company Takeover Proposal (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse

any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement (including an acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement), commitment or
agreement in principle with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
_Section 5.4(c)_ ) (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "). Anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, prior to the time that
the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company Board
of Directors may, with respect to a bona fide, unsolicited Company Takeover
Proposal that did not result from a breach by the Company, its Subsidiaries
or its Representatives of this _Section 5.4_ , make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or cause the Company to terminate

 



\- 52 - this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(g)_ (including paying the
Company Termination Fee) in order to enter into a definitive agreement
relating to such Company Superior Proposal if, and only if, prior to taking
either such action the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith
after consultation with the Companys independent financial advisor and
outside legal counsel that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 7.1(g)_ , (A) the Company has given Parent at least
four Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action
and has provided to Parent the identity of the person making such
Company Takeover Proposal, a copy of any proposed Company Acquisition
Agreements constituting such Company Takeover Proposal, and a copy of any
financing commitments relating thereto (or, in each case, if not provided in
writing to the Company, a written summary of the material terms thereof), (B)
following the end of such notice period, the Company Board of Directors shall
have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation with the
Companys independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the
Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company
Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were to be accepted by
the Company and given effect, and (C) in the event of any change to any of the
financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of
consideration) or any other change to the material terms of such Company
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent
an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) above of
this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall
commence (except that the four Business Day notice period referred to in
clause (A) above of this proviso shall instead end at the later of (1) 11:59
p.m. (Eastern Time) on the second Business Day immediately following Parents
receipt of such notice and (2) the end of the original notice period; during
which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of
clauses (B) and (C) above of this proviso. The actions of the Company Board of
Directors in making a determination that a Company Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and the Companys authorizing and
providing the notices to Parent required by this _Section 5.4(e)_ , if done in
accordance with this _Section 5.4(e)_ , shall not in and of itself,
constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, a violation of this
_Section 5.4_ or a termination of this Agreement. Anything to the contrary
contained herein notwithstanding, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms.

(f) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, other than in
connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, the Company may, at any time
prior to, but not after, the date the Company Shareholder Approval has been
obtained, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Company Intervening Event if the Company has complied with its obligations
under this _Section 5.4_ and prior to taking such action, the Company Board of
Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
members of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that prior to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
(i) the Company has given Parent at least four Business Days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action, and specifying the reasons
therefor, including specifying in reasonable detail the applicable Company
Intervening Event and (ii) following the end of such notice period, the
Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions
to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have
determined, after consultation with the Companys independent financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the members of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law;
provided, that the actions of the Company Board of Directors in making such
determination and the Companys authorizing and providing of such notice
pursuant to this _Section 5.4(f)_ shall not, if done in accordance with
_Section 5.4(f)_ , in and of itself, constitute a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, a violation of this _Section 5.4_ or a termination of
this Agreement.

 



\- 53 - (g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders
of the Company (i) a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii)
directing any person (or the representative of that person) that makes a
Company Takeover Proposal to the provisions of this _Section 5.4_ ; _provided_
that in the case of either clause (i) or (ii) no such action, position or
disclosure that would amount to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
shall be permitted, made or taken other than in compliance with _Section
5.4(e)_.

(h) Any violation of the restrictions contained in this  _Section 5.4_ by any
of the Companys Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 5.4_ by the Company.

 

Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") for so long as such Company
Employee remains employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation during such
period, (i) a base salary or base wage rate no less than that provided to such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) a Target Cash
Bonus Opportunity, with the actual amount of any Performance Bonus paid to
such Company Employee to be determined by the business unit leader for the
legacy Company business, subject to the review and approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld) by the Parent Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer, or, if applicable, Target
Commission Opportunity, (iii) a Target Equity Incentive Opportunity, (iv)
continued eligibility (to the extent that such Company Employee was eligible
immediately prior to the Effective Time) for the Companys sabbatical program
on the terms set forth on Section 5.5(a)-2 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, and (v) aggregate employee benefits (excluding benefits
provided for in _Section 5.5(a)(_ _i_ _)-(iv)_ ) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior the Effective Time; _provided_ that, _notwithstanding the
foregoing_ , (x) the Company Employees will be eligible to participate in the
severance plan maintained by Parent with the material terms set forth on
_Section 5.5(a)-1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Parent
Severance Plan_ ") and (y) Parent may cause the Company Employees to commence
participation in Parents 401(k) plan and/or Parents plans providing for
medical, dental and vision insurance benefits, on terms that are the same as
those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time. In addition, without
limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
honor, fulfill and assume all the obligations under the Company Benefit Plans
set forth on Section 5.5(a)-2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in
accordance with their terms on the date hereof.

 



\- 54 - (b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries in which the Company
Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize the service of each
Company Employee with the Company and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date
for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual under such Post-
Closing Plans (including, but not limited to, the Parent Severance Plan), in
each case, to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to
the Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that such recognition of service shall not (i)
apply for purposes of any defined benefit retirement plan or plan that
provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii) operate to duplicate any benefits of
a Company Employee with respect to the same period of service, or (iii) apply
for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (x) under which similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for
prior service or (y) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to
level of benefits or participation. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that
provides medical, dental or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in
which such Company Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall
(A) cause any preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods
under such plan to be waived with respect to such Company Employee to the
extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and (B) credit each Company Employee for an amount equal
to any medical, dental or vision expenses incurred by such Company Employee
in the plan year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to
participate in such Post-Closing Plan, for purposes of any applicable
deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such Post-
Closing Plan to the extent such expenses would have been credited under the
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Such credited expenses shall also count toward
any annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar
limitations that apply under the terms of the applicable plan.

(c) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten Business Days before the anticipated Effective Time, the Company Board of
Directors (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and
take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate the Companys 401(k)
plans (collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "), effective as of the day
prior to the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time and as soon as
practicable following receipt of a favorable determination letter from the
IRS on the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall be
distributed to the participants, and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by
Parents applicable 401(k) plan (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), permit the
Company Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, inclusive of loans to participants), in the
form of cash (or in the case of loans, notes), in an amount equal to the full
account balance distributed to such Company Employee from the Company 401(k)
Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

 



\- 55 - (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with
or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge
or terminate the services of any Company Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit
Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained
or sponsored by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates
to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any other
compensation or benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement
after the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.13_ and
any provision in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in
this _Section 5.5(d)_ shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any
person other than the parties hereto, including any Company Employee or
current or former service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 

(e) Within five Business Days prior to the anticipated Effective Time, the
Company shall provide Parent with a correct and complete list of all Company
Stock Awards outstanding as of the applicable date of delivery, specifying, on
a holder-by-holder basis, (i) the name or identification number of each
holder, (ii) the number of shares subject to each such Company Stock Award,
(iii) the grant date of each such Company Stock Award, (iv) the vesting
schedule of each such Company Stock Award (including, if applicable, any
vesting as a result of the occurrence of the Closing, either alone or in
combination with another event), and (v) the Company Stock Plan pursuant to
which the Company Stock Award was granted.

Section 5.6 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all reasonable things
necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective the Merger, including (i) the preparation and filing of all
forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the
Merger, (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to consummating the Merger,
(iii) taking all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating with
each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, Order, waiting period
expiration or approval of, or any exemption by, any third party, including any
Governmental Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all information
and documentary material required under the HSR Act and those jurisdictions
set forth on Schedule 5.6(a) required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with
the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement,
and (iv) the execution and delivery of any reasonable additional instruments
necessary to consummate Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. Additionally, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to not take any action after the date of this
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining
of, or result in not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any
such Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained prior to the Closing.

 



\- 56 - (b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders,
waiting period expirations or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any
Governmental Entity undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this _Section
5.6_. In that regard, prior to the Closing, each Party shall promptly consult
with the other Parties to this Agreement with respect to and provide any
necessary information and assistance as the other Parties may reasonably
request with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other
Parties (or their counsel) copies of) all notices, submissions, or filings
made by such Party with any Governmental Entity or any other
information supplied by such Party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger. Each Party to this
Agreement shall (A) promptly inform the other Parties to this Agreement, and
if in writing, furnish the other Parties with copies of (or, in the case of
oral communications, advise the other Parties orally of) any communication
from or to any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger, (B) permit the other
Parties to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other Parties in connection with, any proposed communication with
any such Governmental Entity, and (C) to the extent permitted by any
applicable Governmental Entity, give the other Party a reasonable opportunity
to attend and participate in any in-person meetings with such Governmental
Entity regarding the Merger. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Parties agree
that it is Parents primary right to devise and implement the strategy
for all filings, notifications, submissions and communications in connection
with any filing, notice, petition, statement, registration, submission of
information, application or similar filing subject to this Section 5.6 after
consulting with, and taking into account in good faith any comments of, the
Company or its Representatives relating to such strategy. If any Party to this
Agreement or any Representative of such Parties receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Merger, then such Party will use reasonable best efforts
to make, or cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other
Parties to this Agreement in good faith, an appropriate response in
substantial compliance with such request. Each Party shall furnish the other
Parties with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and
memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any
such Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, and
furnish the other Parties with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other Parties may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to any such
Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Company may,
as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section 5.6_ as
"Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel. Anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 5.6_ notwithstanding, materials provided pursuant to this _Section
5.6_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of
Parent, the Company and the Merger and other confidential information, (ii)
as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as necessary
to address reasonable privilege concerns.

 



\- 57 - (c) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as
promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than 15 Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, all notifications required under the HSR
Act. In the event that the Parties receive a request for information or
documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act (a " _Second Request_ "), the
Parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such
Second Request as promptly as practicable, and counsel for both Parties will
closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review
process. The Parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to supply as
promptly as practicable and advisable any additional information and
documentary material that may be required under any other Antitrust Law
and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under any other Antitrust Law
prior to the Outside End Date.

 

(d) In the event that any litigation, claim, suit, action or proceeding is
commenced challenging the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such litigation, claim,
suit, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Order resulting therefrom, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e) Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding,
Parent and Merger Sub agree to take any and all steps necessary to ensure the
absence at the Outside End Date of any (x) requirement for any non-action,
consent or approval of any state attorney general or other Governmental
Entity, (y) Order in any suit or proceeding and (z) other matter relating to
any Antitrust Law which would preclude consummation of the Merger by the
Outside End Date, so as to enable the Parties to complete the Merger as
promptly as practicable, including committing to or taking by consent decree,
hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, holding
separate, or other disposition of or restriction on any assets, licenses,
product lines, operations or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, or accepting any operational restrictions or
otherwise taking or committing to take actions that would, after the Effective
Time, limit Parents or any of its Affiliates freedom of action with respect
to any of the assets, licenses, product lines, operations or businesses of
any of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_
, that, anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding,
Parent shall not be required to (i) sell, divest, exclusively license, hold
separate, or otherwise dispose of, or (ii) grant any non-exclusive license,
accept any operational restrictions or take or commit to take any actions
which restrictions or actions would limit Parents or any of its Affiliates
freedom of action with respect to, assets, licenses, product lines, operations
or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
that individually or in the aggregate, generated total collective revenues in
excess of $125 million in Parents or the Companys fiscal year 2016, as
applicable (the " _Revenue Cap_ "), except that, in the case of clause (ii),
the revenues of the asset, license, product line, operation or business
impacted by such non-exclusive license, operational restriction or action,
respectively, shall be considered in determining whether the Revenue Cap has
been achieved only if: (A) such restrictions or actions would limit Parents
or its Affiliates freedom of action after the Effective Time with respect to
such impacted asset, product line, operation or business, respectively, of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in a respect that
is material to such impacted asset, product line, operation or business,
respectively, of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(it being understood that an

 



\- 58 - obligation to continue selling or supporting a product in any jurisdiction
shall not, in and of itself, be construed to be a material limitation, or (B)
in the case of a non-exclusive license, the adverse effect of such non-
exclusive license is non- _de minimis_ with respect to the impacted asset,
license, product line, operation or business, respectively of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, Parent shall not be required to agree
to or accept any obligation to permit any third party to invest (whether
directly or indirectly, including via joint venture or similar arrangement) in
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

 

Section 5.7 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/ Prospectus;
Company Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause to be
filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in preliminary form, and
(ii) Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger,
which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with respect to the Company
Stockholder Meeting. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (A) have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, (B) ensure that the Form
S-4 complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act or Securities Act, and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective for so
long as necessary to complete the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent
shall furnish all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the
holders of its shares to the other and provide such other assistance as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing
and distribution of the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of the
Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and shall, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies
of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC and advise the
other party on any oral comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect
to the Form S-4. The foregoing notwithstanding, prior to filing the Form S-4
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding
to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and
Parent shall cooperate and provide the other a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response in advance (including the
proposed final version of such document or response), except to the extent
such disclosures relate to a Company Takeover Proposal. Parent shall advise
the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of
effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating
thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any
such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent
shall also take any

 



\- 59 - other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of the shares of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning the Company and the holders of the Company Common
Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other Parties, and the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or
supplement to, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 and, to the
extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to stockholders of the Company. Nothing in this
_Section 5.7(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any Party under _Section
5.7(a)_. For purposes of this _Section 5.7_ , any information concerning or
related to the Company, its Affiliates or the Company Stockholder Meeting
will be deemed to have been provided by the Company, and any information
concerning or related to Parent or its Affiliates will be deemed to have been
provided by Parent.

 

(c) The Company shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company
Organizational Documents, all action necessary to mail the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the Companys stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC and
to convene a meeting of the Companys stockholders to consider the proposal to
adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ ") as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of mailing of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (including setting an appropriate record date for the
Company Stockholder Meeting). The Company shall, through the Company Board of
Directors, make the Company Recommendation, include such Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and solicit and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, except,
in each case, during such time as a valid Company Adverse Recommendation
Change is in effect, and shall not submit any other proposal (other than, if
the Company Stockholder Meeting is also the Companys annual
stockholder meeting, proposals customarily brought in connection with the
Companys annual stockholder meeting) to such holders in connection with the
Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent. The
foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.7(c)_ notwithstanding, the Company
shall have the right, without the prior consent of Parent, to make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholder Meeting
(A) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus required under applicable Law is timely provided to the
stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time, in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board of Directors (after consultation with its
outside counsel), in advance of the Company Stockholder Meeting, (B) if
required by applicable Law or a request from the SEC or its staff or (C) if,
on a date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company
has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of
Company Common Stock to obtain the

 



\- 60 - Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present; _provided_
that (1) the duration of any such adjournment or postponement shall be
limited to the minimum duration reasonably necessary to remedy the
circumstances giving rise to such adjournment or postponement: (2) no single
such adjournment or postponement shall be for more than five Business Days
except as may be required by federal securities Laws; and (3) in the case of
clause (C), the Company Stockholder Meeting shall not be postponed to later
than the date that is 20 Business Days after the date for which the Company
Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled without the prior written consent
of Parent. All other postponements or adjournments shall require the prior
written consent of Parent. Nothing contained in this Agreement,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, shall be deemed to relieve the Company of its obligations to submit
this Agreement to its stockholders for a vote on the approval and adoption
thereof.

 

Section 5.8 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority,"
"affiliate transactions" or "business combination statute or regulation" or
other similar state anti-takeover Laws and regulations becomes applicable to
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(b) if any such Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to grant
such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. The Parties shall consult with one another
prior to issuing, and provide each other with the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any public announcement, statement or other disclosure with
respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not issue any such public
announcement or statement prior to such consultation, except as may
be required by Law or by the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq (in which
event such Party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the
circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other Party to
review and comment upon such public announcement or statement in advance and
shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto); _provided_ that, (i) each of the Company and Parent may
make press releases or public announcements concerning this Agreement or the
Merger that consist solely of information previously disclosed in previous
press releases or announcements made by Parent and/or the Company in
compliance with this _Section 5.9_ and (ii) each of the Company and Parent
may make any public statements in response to questions by the press,
analysts, investors or analysts or those participating in investor calls or
industry conferences, so long as such statements consist solely of information
previously disclosed in previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by Parent and/or the Company in compliance with this _Section
5.9_. The Company shall not be required to provide any review or comment to
Parent regarding any statement, release or disclosure in response to or in
connection with the receipt and existence of a Company Takeover Proposal, its
consideration of making or its making of a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or any matters related thereto, and following any public statement,
release or disclosure by the Company in respect of any of the foregoing
matters, Parent shall not be required to provide any review or comment to the
Company regarding any statement, release or disclosure made by Parent with
respect to such matters. The Company and Parent agree to issue the previously
agreed upon form of joint press release announcing the execution and delivery
of this Agreement promptly following the execution of this Agreement.

 



\- 61 - Section 5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from Liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and related advancement
of expenses now existing in favor of any present and former director, officer
and employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each person who
served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request or for the benefit of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (collectively, together with their respective heirs, executors and
administrators, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the
Company Organizational Documents (or Company Subsidiary Organizational
Documents) or any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date
hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Company
Indemnified Parties. The foregoing notwithstanding, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any Company Indemnified Party with respect to
matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the rights to indemnification and
exculpation from Liabilities and advancement of expenses referenced in the
preceding sentence shall continue in effect until the final disposition of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless
each Company Indemnified Party against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or Liabilities

investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other fiduciary in any entity,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request or
for the benefit of the Company and pertaining to matters existing or occurring
or actions or omissions taken prior to or at the Effective Time, including
with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, also advance expenses to the Company
Indemnified Parties as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company Indemnified Party to whom

_Section 5.10_ or otherwise.

 



\- 62 - (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving

insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims arising from facts or events, or actions or omissions, which occurred
or are alleged to have occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make
annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed
300% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving
Corporations good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available
at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the
foregoing, Parent or the Company may obtain at or prior to the Effective Time
a six-year prepaid "tail" policy providing equivalent coverage to that
described in the preceding sentence; _provided_ that if the total cost for
such prepaid "tail" policy exceeds the Premium Cap, then the Surviving
Corporation may obtain a prepaid "tail" policy with the maximum coverage
available for a total cost of the Premium Cap. If such prepaid policies have
been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in
full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving
corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

5.10_ shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such
Company Indemnified Party may have under the Company Organizational Documents
(or Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents) or under applicable Law. The
provisions of this _Section 5.10_ shall survive the Effective Time and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. In the event of
any breach by the Surviving Corporation or Parent of this _Section 5.10_ ,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses,
including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the Company Indemnified
Parties in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
_Section 5.10_ as such fees are incurred upon the written request of such
Company Indemnified Party.

 

Section 5.11 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any Partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other Partys
operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its

to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in the Merger and all fees and
expenses of Parent due on the Closing Date, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter in accordance
with its terms ( _provided_ that the Commitment Letter may be amended,

under the Commitment Letter, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Parent to the funding of the Financing set forth in the
Commitment Letter and within Parents control, (iv) negotiate and enter into

in accordance with its terms on the Closing Date in the event that the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ and the conditions
precedent to the Financing have been satisfied or, upon funding would be
satisfied, in each case to the extent the Financing is needed to consummate
the Merger.

 

(b) Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to, agree to or permit
any amendment, replacement or other modification of, or waive any of its
rights or remedies under, the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements
with respect thereto without the Companys prior written consent; _provided_
that Parent or Merger Sub may, without the Companys prior written consent
(x) enter into any amendment, replacement or other modification to or waiver
of any provision of the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement with
respect thereto that (i) would not reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Merger or make
the timely funding of the Financing or the satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing materially less likely to occur, (ii) does not reduce
the commitment amount of the Financing unless the aggregate amount of the
Financing following such reduction, together with other financial resources
available to Parent (including any amounts funded into an escrow account with
release provisions no less favorable in any material respect to Parent than
the conditions precedent set forth in the Commitment Letter), is sufficient to
consummate the Merger or (iii) does not materially and adversely affect the
ability of Parent or its Subsidiaries to enforce their rights against the
other parties to the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement with
respect thereto; and (y) amend, replace or otherwise modify the Commitment

of this Agreement. Parent shall furnish the Company with any such amendments,
modifications or waivers to the Commitment Letter or definitive agreement with
respect thereto (which may be redacted as provided in _Section 4.12_ ). Upon

shall mean the Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced or modified.

 



\- 64 - (c) If funds in the amounts set forth in the Commitment Letter or any
definitive agreements with respect thereto, as applicable, or any portion
thereof, becomes unavailable, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, use its
or their reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute financing sufficient,
together with other financial resources available to Parent, to consummate the
Merger (any such financing, a " _Substitute Financing_ "). In the event any
Substitute Financing is obtained, references in this Agreement to the
Financing shall also be deemed to refer to such Substitute Financing, and
references in this Agreement to the Commitment Letter and the definitive
financing agreements with respect thereto shall also be deemed to refer to
the Substitute Financing and the definitive financing agreements with respect
thereto, and all obligations of Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ shall
be applicable thereto as to the same extent as Parents obligations
with respect to the Financing.

(d) Parent shall have the right to reduce the commitments under the Commitment
Letter (i) by the amount of the proceeds of consummated offerings or other
incurrences of debt after the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that (A) such
debt does not mature prior to the Closing Date and (B) to the extent such debt
has a scheduled special or mandatory redemption right, such right is not
exercisable prior to the earliest of the consummation of the Merger on the
Closing Date, the termination of this Agreement or the End Date and (ii) in
accordance with the mandatory prepayment and commitment reduction provisions
set forth in the Commitment Letter; _provided_ that any substitute commitments
that result in any such mandatory prepayment and commitment reduction are on
terms that (A) would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay
or materially impede the consummation of the Merger or make the timely funding
of the Financing or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing materially less likely to occur, and (B) do not materially
and adversely affect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Commitment Letter with respect to any remaining
commitments. The representations, warranties, covenants and other restrictions
of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement with respect to the
Financing and the Commitment Letter apply equally to such substitute
commitments.

(e) Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any breach of any part of
the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement with respect thereto of
which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware or any termination thereof that is
reasonably likely to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the Merger or make the timely funding of the Financing or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing materially less
likely to occur. Upon the reasonable request of the Company, Parent shall
provide the Company information in reasonable detail about the status of its
efforts to arrange the Financing.

 

(f) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their
reasonable best efforts to provide (and to use their reasonable best efforts

unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related unaudited consolidated
statements of income and cash flows of the Company for each subsequent interim
quarterly period of the Company that has ended at least 40 days prior to the
Effective Time (and comparable periods for the prior fiscal year), in the case
of each of clauses (I)(A) and (I)(B), prepared in accordance with GAAP and

10-Q, as applicable; and (C) all other financial statements, financial data,
audit reports and other information (including such information as is

under the Securities Act for a registered public offering of debt or equity
securities of Parent or as otherwise necessary to permit the Companys
independent accountants to issue "comfort letters" to Parents Financing
Sources (which such accountants have confirmed they are prepared to issue),
including as to customary negative assurances and change period in order to
consummate any debt or equity capital markets transaction comprising a part of
the Financing, and (II) such other financial and other information relating
to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries customary for the completion of
the Financing, (iv) using commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Companys independent accountants to provide reasonable assistance to
Parent in connection with the Financing consistent with their customary
practice (including to consent to the use of their audit reports on the

Financing, in each case, on customary terms and consistent with their
customary practice), (v) if requested in writing by a Financing Source at

be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (except as otherwise
provided below, whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval), as follows:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or prior to 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 26, 2017 (the "
_Initial End Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not be available to any
Party whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
proximately caused or resulted in the Effective Time not occurring prior to
the End Date, and _provided_ , _further_ , that if on the End Date all of the
conditions to Closing, other than the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.1(c)_ or _Section 6.1(d)_ as it relates to an Antitrust Law, shall

, _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section

becoming final and nonappealable) was due to the material breach by such Party
of any covenant or other agreement of such Party set forth in this Agreement;

not have been obtained at the Company Stockholder Meeting or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof, in each case at which a vote on such

(e) by the Company ( _provided_ that the Company is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained

result in the conditions in _Article VI_ not being satisfied and (ii) which
breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy is either not curable or is not cured
by the earlier of (A) the End Date and (B) the date that is 30 Business Days
following written notice from the Company to Parent describing such breach or
failure in reasonable detail;

(f) by Parent ( _provided_ that Parent is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), (i)
if the Company has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained in this Agreement, which breach would result in the
conditions in _Article VI_ not being satisfied; and (ii) which breach, failure
to perform or inaccuracy is either not curable or is not cured by the earlier
of (A) the End Date and (B) the date that is 30 Business Days following
written notice from Parent to the Company describing such breach or failure in
reasonable detail;

 



\- 72 - (g) by the Company, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
in accordance with  _Section 5.4_ in order to accept a Company Superior
Proposal, subject to the prior or concurrent payment of the Company
Termination Fee to Parent; or

 

(h) by Parent, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, at any
time following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or if the Company
shall be in material and Willful Breach of _Section 5.4_.

The party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1_
 shall give written notice of such termination to the other parties in
accordance with _Section 8.7_ , specifying the provision of this Agreement
pursuant to which such termination is effected.

 

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , this Agreement shall terminate (except
that the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of _Section 5.13(_ _i_
_)_ , this _Section 7.2_ , _Section 7.3_ , _Section 7.4_ and _Article VIII_
shall survive any termination), and there shall be no other Liability on the
part of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other
hand, to the other except (i) as provided in _Section 5.13(_ _i_ _)_ ,
_Section 7.3_ and _Section 7.4_ or (ii) Liability arising out of or resulting
from fraud or any Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement occurring
prior to termination (in which case the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to
all rights and remedies available at law or in equity). 

Section 7.3 _Company Termination Fee_ _s_.

 

(a) If (i) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)_ (and at the End Date all of the conditions to the Companys
obligations to close other than receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
have been satisfied, or are capable of satisfaction had the Closing occurred
on the End Date) or _Section 7.1(d)_ , (ii) a Company Takeover Proposal
shall have been publicly announced or publicly disclosed after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the End Date (in the case of a termination
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ ) or the Company Stockholder Meeting (in the case
of a termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ ), and was not definitively
withdrawn at least ten Business Days prior to the End Date (in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ ) or at least five Business Days
before the Company Stockholder Meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant
to _Section 7.1(d)_ ) and (iii) at any time on or prior to the 12-month
anniversary of such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, a transaction
included within the definition of a Company Takeover Proposal with any Person
(a " _Company Takeover Transaction_ "), the Company shall pay Parent the
Company Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to an account designated by
Parent) in immediately available funds, upon the earlier of entering into such
definitive agreement with respect to any Company Takeover Transaction or the
consummation of any Company Takeover Transaction; _provided_ that for the
purposes of clause (iii) only, all references in the definition of Company
Takeover Proposal to 25% shall instead be references to "50%."

 



\- 73 - (b) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ , the
Company shall pay Parent the Company Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to an
account designated by Parent) in immediately available funds, within three
Business Days after such termination.

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(g)_ , the Company shall cause to be paid to Parent the
Company Termination Fee immediately prior to or concurrently with, and as a
condition to the effectiveness of, such termination.

(d) " _Company Termination Fee_ " shall mean $490,000,000, in cash. Anything
to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, if the Company Termination
Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with this _Section 7.3_ , from
and after such termination and payment of the Company Termination Fee in full
pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 7.3_ , the Company and its
Affiliates and Representatives (in the case of a payment of the Company
Termination Fee by the Company) shall have no further Liability of any kind
for any reason in connection with this Agreement or the termination
contemplated hereby other than as provided under this _Section 7.3_ , except
in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of this Agreement. Each of the
Parties hereto acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee is not intended
to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which the Company Termination
Fee is due and payable and which do not involve fraud or Willful Breach of
this Agreement, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall Parent
be entitled to more than one payment of the Company Termination Fee
in connection with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which such
Company Termination Fee is payable. For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent
and Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance
with  _Section_ _8.5(a)_ and the payment of the Company Termination Fee under
this _Section 7.3_ , under no circumstances shall Parent and Merger Sub be
permitted or entitled to receive the Company Termination Fee (if entitled
under this  _Section 7.3_ ) if the Merger is consummated.

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.3_  are an integral part of the Merger, and that, without these agreements,
Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to this
_Section 7.3_ , then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and
expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in
the collection of such overdue amount, including in connection with any
related claims, actions or proceedings commenced and (ii) the Company shall
pay to Parent interest on such amount from and including the date payment of
such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime
rate set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made.

 



\- 74 - Section 7.4 _Parent Termination Fees_.

 

(a) Parent will pay to the Company a termination fee of $700,000,000 in cash
(the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") if this Agreement is terminated as
follows:

(i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ , if, as of the time
of such termination, the only conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VI_
that have not been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, provided such conditions
would have been capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date
the notice of termination is delivered) are those set forth in _Section
6.1(c)_ (solely due to an Order arising under, or a Law that is an, Antitrust
Law) or _Section 6.1(d)_ , such payment to be made concurrently with such
termination, in the case of a termination by Parent, or within three Business
Days following such termination, in the case of a termination by the Company,
in each case by wire transfer (to an account designated by the Company) in
immediately available funds; or

(ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ , if (A) the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ would have been capable of being
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date the notice of termination is
delivered, and (B) the Law is an Antitrust Law or the Order is
issued pursuant to an Antitrust Law, such payment to be made concurrently
with such termination, in the case of a termination by Parent, or within three
Business Days following such termination, in the case of a termination by the
Company, in each case by wire transfer (to an account designated by the
Company) in immediately available funds.

(b) Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, if the Parent
Termination Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with this _Section
7.4_ , from and after such termination and payment of the Parent Termination
Fee in full pursuant to and in accordance with this  _Section 7.4_ , Parent
and its Affiliates and Representatives (in the case of a payment of the Parent
Termination Fee by Parent) shall have no further Liability of any kind for any
reason in connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated
hereby other than as provided under this _Section 7.4_ , except in the case of
fraud or a Willful Breach of this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereto
acknowledges that the Parent Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty,
but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
the Company in the circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is due
and payable and which do not involve fraud or Willful Breach of this
Agreement, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall the Company be
entitled to more than one payment of the Parent Termination Fee in connection
with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which the Parent Termination
Fee is payable. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both
a grant of specific performance in accordance with _Section 8.5(a)_ and the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee under this _Section 7.4_ , under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive the
Parent Termination Fee (if entitled under this _Section 7.4_ ) if the Merger
is consummated.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this _Section 7.4_ are an integral part of the Merger, and that, without these
agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
Parent fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to this
Section _7.4_ , then (i) Parent shall reimburse the Company for all costs and
expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel)

 



\- 75 -  incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in connection
with any related claims, actions or proceedings commenced and (ii) Parent
shall pay to the Company interest on such amount from and including the date
payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at
the prime rate set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made.

Parent in respect of the fiscal year in respect of which such opportunity is
being provided to such Company Employee.

(lxii) " _Target Commission Opportunity_ " means the target commission amount
for the Companys fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs.

(lxiii) " _Target Equity Incentive Opportunity_ " means the opportunity to
receive an annual equity-based award on Parent Common Stock having a Grant
Date Fair Value no less than:

 

(A) if the Company Employee received one or more ordinary course "refresh"
Company Stock Awards at any time during the 30-month period ending on the
Closing Date (the " _Award_ _Look-Back Period_ "), (1) the Grant Date Fair
Value of the most recent "refresh" Company Stock Award granted to such Company
Employee during the portion of the Award Look-Back Period that occurred prior
to July 22, 2016 (the " _Award Measurement Period_ ") or (2) if the Company
Employee did not receive a "refresh" Company Stock Award during the Award
Measurement Period, the average Grant Date Fair Value of "refresh" Company
Stock Awards granted to similarly situated Company Employees during the Award
Measurement Period; or

 

(B) if the Company Employee did not receive an ordinary course "refresh"
Company Stock Award during the Award Look-Back Period but received a new hire
Company Stock Award during the Award Look-Back Period, (1) the Grant Date Fair
Value of such new hire Company Stock Award, if granted during the Award
Measurement Period or (2) if such new hire Company Stock Award was
not granted during the Award Measurement Period, the average Grant Date Fair
Value of new hire Company Stock Awards granted to similarly situated Company
Employees during the Award Measurement Period, pro-rated into an annualized
amount in accordance with the Companys formula for differentiating new hire
equity awards from annual "refresh" Company Stock Awards in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, if a Company Employee did not receive either an
annual "refresh" or new hire Company Stock Award at any time during the Award
Look-Back Period, then such Company Employees Target Equity Incentive
Opportunity shall be zero.

 

(lxiv) " _Tax_ " means any federal, state, local or foreign tax, impost, levy,

any Governmental Entity responsible for the imposition of any such tax with
respect thereto.
