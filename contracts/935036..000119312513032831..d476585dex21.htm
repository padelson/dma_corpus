the conditions to the Offer are satisfied or waived but the number of Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn, together with the Shares held by Parent
and Purchaser, if any, is less than 90% of the then-outstanding number of
Shares, then subject to _Section 8.1_, upon the Expiration Date and the
initial purchase of Shares by Purchaser on the Acceptance Date, Purchaser
will provide "subsequent offering periods," as such term is defined in, and in
accordance with, Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act (a "
_Subsequent Offering Period_ "), for an aggregate period not to exceed 20
Business Days (for all such extensions) and Purchaser will (i) give the
required notice of such Subsequent Offering Period and (ii) accept and
promptly pay for all Shares tendered as of such applicable expiration date in
accordance with _Section 2.4_. The Offer Documents will provide for the
possibility of a Subsequent Offering Period in a manner consistent with this
_Section 2.1(c)_.

 

(d) Upon the satisfaction or waiver (subject to _Section 2.1(b)_) by
Purchaser of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ , Purchaser will accept
for payment and pay for Shares properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer (in accordance with _Section 2.4_) as promptly as practicable but
in any event within three Business Days of such scheduled Expiration Date
(the date of acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ "). In the event
Shares are properly tendered and not withdrawn following the Acceptance Date,
whether or not pursuant to a Subsequent Offering Period, Purchaser will
accept for payment and pay the applicable Per Share Amount promptly after the
tender of such Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.1_ and _Section
2.4_.

 

(e) Parent will provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis
the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated
to purchase pursuant to the Offer. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
Purchaser expressly reserves the right to delay payment for Shares in order to
comply in whole or in part with applicable laws. Any such delay will
be effected in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act.

(f) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date this Agreement
(but in no event later than the twentieth Business Day following the date of
this Agreement), Purchaser will file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO will contain or
incorporate by reference an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ")
and forms of the related letter of transmittal and other customary documents
(the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and such other documents, together
with all supplements and amendments thereto, being referred to herein
collectively as the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Company and its counsel will
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents prior to their filing with the SEC and Parent and Purchaser will
consider in good faith all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Purchaser will
(i) provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written comments
(or a description of any oral comments) received by Parent, Purchaser or their
counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents

 



13  promptly after receipt of such comments, (ii) consult with the Company (and
give the Company and its counsel reasonable opportunity to review) regarding
any such comments prior to responding thereto, and Parent and Purchaser will
consider in good faith all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel, and (iii) provide the
Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments or responses
thereto. Parent and Purchaser will endeavor in good faith to respond promptly
to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents.
Parent and Purchaser agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares to the extent required by
applicable law and under the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq.
Parent, Purchaser and the Company will each promptly correct any information
provided by any of them for use in the Offer Documents that becomes false or
misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser will further take
all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be filed
with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws to give effect to the Offer.

(g) Neither Parent nor Purchaser will terminate the Offer without the prior
written consent of the Company except pursuant to _Article VIII._ If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ , Purchaser will, and
Parent will cause Purchaser to, promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of
such termination) terminate the Offer and not acquire any Shares pursuant
thereto. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ ,
Purchaser will promptly return, and will cause any depositary acting on behalf
of Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable law, all tendered Shares
to the registered holders thereof.

 

(h) Following the Acceptance Date (and the expiration of any Subsequent
Offering Period, if applicable), Parent, Purchaser and the Company will cause
the Merger to become effective as promptly as practicable.

2.2. _Company Action_. (a) Subject to  _Section 5.8_, the Company hereby
consents to the Offer and the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company
Board Recommendation.

(b) On the date that Purchaser files the Schedule TO, the Company will file
with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_
") containing the Company Board Recommendation and will disseminate the
Schedule 14D-9 as required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
and any other applicable federal securities laws with the Offer Documents.
Except with respect to any amendments filed in connection with a Superior
Proposal or a Company Change of Recommendation, Parent and Purchaser, and
their respective counsel, will be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any supplement or amendments thereto
prior to its filing with the SEC and the Company will consider in good faith
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent
Purchaser and their respective counsel. Except with respect to any amendments
filed in connection with a Superior Proposal or a Company Change of

 



14  Recommendation, the Company will (i) provide Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel with a copy of any written comments (or a description of any oral
comments) received by the Company or its counsel from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments,
(ii) consult with Parent and Purchaser (and give each a reasonable opportunity
to review) regarding any such comments prior to responding thereto and the
Company will consider in good faith all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel, and (iii)
provide Parent and Purchaser with copies of any written comments or responses
thereto. The Company, Parent and Purchaser will promptly correct any
information provided by each for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the
extent that such information has become false or misleading in any material
respect. The Company will also take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws.

 

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company will cause its transfer agent to
furnish Purchaser with mailing labels or electronic files containing the
names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with security position
listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of the then most recent
practical date, together with all other available listings and computer files
containing names, addresses and security position listings of record holders
and beneficial owners of Shares. The Company will furnish Purchaser with such
additional information, including updated listings and computer files of
the Companys stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings,
and such other assistance in disseminating the Offer Documents to holders of
Shares, as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably request, all at Purchasers
expense. The Company, Parent and Purchaser will disseminate the Offer
Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of Shares together in the same
mailing or other form of distribution. Subject to the requirements of
applicable law, and except for such actions as are reasonably necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents, each of Parent and Purchaser will hold all
information and documents provided to it under this _Section 2.2(c)_ in
confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

2.3. _Top-Up Option_. (a) Subject to this _Section 2.3_, the Company hereby
grants to Purchaser an option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase at a
price per share of Company Common Stock equal to the Per Share Amount (the "
_Top-Up Share Price_ "), a number (but not less than that number) of newly
issued Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") that, when added to the number
of Shares beneficially owned by Parent at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option, constitutes 90% of the number of Shares that will be outstanding
immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, _provided_ , that
in no event will such number of Shares exceed the number of authorized and
unissued Shares not otherwise reserved for issuance for outstanding Company
Stock Options or Company Restricted Share Units or other obligations of the
Company. The Top-Up Option may be exercised, in whole but not in part, at any
one time on or after the Acceptance Date and prior to the earliest to occur of
(i) the Effective Time, (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Article VIII_ , or (iii) the occurrence of the fifth Business Day
following the Expiration Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation of
the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the

 



15  Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (A) no provision of any
applicable law and no judgment, injunction, order or decree of any
Governmental Authority prohibits such exercise, (B) at the time of exercise,
Purchaser owns more than 50% of the Fully Diluted Shares but less than 90% of
the Shares then-outstanding, (C) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the
number of Shares owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Purchaser
constitutes 90% of the number of Shares that will be outstanding immediately
after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, (D) the number of Top-Up
Option Shares issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option may in no event exceed
the number of authorized and unissued Shares not otherwise reserved for
issuance for outstanding Company Stock Options or other obligations of the
Company, and (E) Purchaser has accepted for payment and paid for all Shares
validly tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn.

(b) Upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option in accordance with _Section
2.3(a)_, Purchaser will notify the Company and set forth in such notice (i)
the number of shares of Company Capital Stock expected to be owned,
beneficially and of record, by Parent or Purchaser immediately preceding the
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, (ii) a place and time for the closing
of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, and (iii) Purchasers agreement
to (and Parents agreement to cause Purchaser to) consummate the Merger in
accordance with the DGCL as contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable following issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Company will,
as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Purchaser of
the number of Shares then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Option Shares.
At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, Purchaser will pay
the Company the aggregate purchase price required to be paid for the Top-Up
Option Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.3_, and the Company will cause to
be issued to Purchaser a Certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares,
which may include any legends required by applicable securities laws. At its
election, Purchaser may pay the aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-
Up Option Shares either (A) in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Company or (B) by executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note in form mutually acceptable by
Parent and the Company having a principal amount equal to the balance of the
aggregate purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares and an interest rate
equal to the per annum interest rate payable with respect to the revolver
under the Companys Credit Agreement with Bank of America dated February 21,
2007 (as in effect on the date hereof), which promissory note will be payable
in full with accrued interest immediately at the Effective Time. Each of the
Parties will use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any
issuance of Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all
applicable laws. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, in any appraisal
proceeding related to this Agreement, the fair value of the shares of Company
Capital Stock subject to the appraisal proceeding will be determined in
accordance with the DGCL without regard to the exercise by Purchaser of the
Top-Up Option, any shares of Company Common Stock issued upon exercise of
the Top-Up Option or the promissory note referred to in this _Section
2.3(b)_.

(c) Parent and Purchaser understand that the Shares that Purchaser may
acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the

 



16  Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder
for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Purchaser
represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, and will be upon any
exercise of the Top-Up Option, an "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule
501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act). Purchaser agrees
that any Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option will be acquired for the purpose of investment and not with a view to
or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning
of the Securities Act.

 

(d) In the event of any change in the number of shares of outstanding Company
Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization,
combination, exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, reorganization or the
like or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company
that would have the effect of diluting Purchasers rights under the Top-Up
Option, the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the Top-Up Share Price will be
adjusted appropriately so as to restore to Purchaser its rights hereunder with
respect to the Top-Up Option as the same exists as of the date of this
Agreement. 

2.4. _Payment; Surrender of Certificates_. (a) Parent will appoint the
Companys transfer agent to act as disbursement agent (the _"Disbursement
Agent_ ") for the Offer.

(b) Promptly following the Acceptance Date, Parent will deposit with the
Disbursement Agent, for disbursement in accordance with this _Article II_ ,
cash in an amount sufficient for payment in respect of the aggregate Per Share
Amount payable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (collectively, the " _Offer
Disbursement Fund_ "). In the event that the cash in the Disbursement Fund is
insufficient to satisfy fully all of the payment obligations to be made by the
Disbursement Agent hereunder, Parent will promptly make available to the
Disbursement Agent the amounts so required to satisfy such payment obligations
in full. The Disbursement Agent will deliver the cash payments contemplated to
be paid for Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the Offer Disbursement
Fund as contemplated by this Agreement. Except as contemplated by this
_Section 2.4_, the Offer Disbursement Fund will not be used for any other
purpose. Amounts of cash in the Offer Disbursement Fund will be invested by
the Disbursement Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ __, _however_ , that
no such investment or losses thereon will affect the amounts payable to the
holders of Shares. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments will be payable to Parent.

(c) Upon surrender to the Disbursement Agent of a Certificate for
cancellation together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Certificate will promptly be provided in exchange therefor cash in the amount
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_ , and the
Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be canceled. No interest will accrue
or be paid with respect to any consideration to be delivered upon surrender of
Certificates.

 



17 (d) If any cash payment is to be made in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment pays any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making of such
payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such holder or
requesting Person, or will establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Disbursement Agent that such Tax has been paid or is inapplicable.

(e) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Disbursement Agent to
the extent in accordance with customary practice, the posting by such Person
of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Disbursement Agent will
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with
respect to such Certificate, the Disbursement Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the amount payable to the holder
thereof pursuant to _Article II_.

(f) Each of the Disbursement Agent and Parent will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration, or other amounts, payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Shares or any other Person such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under any applicable law (including any withholding
provision of the Code and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder). To
the extent amounts are deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section 2.4_,
such amounts will be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid
and such amounts shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law and notice thereof will be provided to the
applicable holder of Shares. Any purported withholding of Taxes from payments
or other deliveries made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement,
the amount of which was forwarded to the relevant Governmental
Authority, will not be deemed a breach of this Agreement and the amount so
withheld shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid,
notwithstanding that withholding of Taxes might have not been required.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.4_, none
of the Disbursement Agent, Parent or any party hereto will be liable to a
holder of Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

2.5. _Waiver of Redemption Rights of Preferred Stock_. On behalf of itself and
its successors in interest to the Preferred Shares, upon the Acceptance Date
and its purchase of the Preferred Shares pursuant to the Shareholder
Agreement, Purchaser waives any right to payment on the Preferred Shares under
Section 3 of the Certificate of Designations in connection with the Offer,
the Top-Up Option and any Change of Control (as defined in the Certificate of
Designations) effected thereby. Purchaser

 



18  further agrees on behalf of itself and its successors in interest to the
Preferred Shares that it will not have the right to redemption of the
Preferred Stock under Section 8 of the Certificate of Designations until the
later of (i) the first date permitted for redemption set forth in Section 8 of
the Certificate of Designations and (ii) the termination date of this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that upon the termination of this
Agreement the terms of the Certificate of Designation will govern the
Preferred Shares. The certificate(s) representing the Preferred Shares will
bear a legend referring to the agreements of Purchaser set forth in this
_Section 2.5_ and that such agreements will be binding upon any transferee or
successor in interest to the Preferred Shares. In connection therewith, in the
event the Purchaser transfers the Preferred Shares, it will first obtain an
agreement from transferee in form and substance satisfactory to the Company
pursuant to which the transferee agrees to be bound by the provisions of this
_Section 2.5_.

 

III. _THE MERGER_

3.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, Purchaser
will merge with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective
Time, the separate corporate existence of Purchaser will terminate. The
Company will be the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ")
and will continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Delaware.

3.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
at the offices of Jones Day, 222 East 41st Street, New York, New York, at
10:00 a.m. prevailing Eastern time, on the first Business Day (unless the
Parties agree to another time or date) after satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in  _Article VII_ , other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the fulfillment
or waiver of those conditions, or at such other time, date or location as the
parties mutually agree in writing (the date upon which the Closing actually
occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ").

3.3. _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Parties will cause the Merger
to be consummated by executing and delivering a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
for filing in accordance with Section 103 of the DGCL. The Parties will make
any and all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL, and the
Merger will become effective when the Certificate of Merger is filed in the
office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later
date or time as Parent and the Company mutually agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the time the Merger becomes
effective being referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").

3.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects prescribed by
the DGCL and any other applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser will vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Purchaser will become the
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



19 3.5. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. (a) At the Effective Time,
the certificate of incorporation of the Company will be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and will be amended so as to read
in its entirety as set forth on _Exhibit A_ until thereafter further amended
in accordance with its terms and as provided by applicable law (subject to
the requirements of _Section 6.1_).

(b) The bylaws of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
as provided therein or by applicable law (subject to the requirements of
_Section 6.1_).

 

3.6. _Directors and Officers_. The initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation will be the directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation will be the officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly appointed.

3.7. _Conversion or Cancellation of Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any
stockholder of the Company:

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, other than Exception Shares (which will be canceled and cease to exist
with no payment being made with respect thereto), Company Restricted Share
Units (which will be treated in accordance with  _Schedule 3.9_) and
Dissenting Shares (which will be treated in accordance with _Section 3.10_),
will be converted into and constitute the right to receive cash in an amount
equal to the Per Share Amount, without interest (the "Common _Merger
Consideration_ "). Each Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than the Preferred Shares beneficially
owned by Parent, which will remain outstanding) and Dissenting Shares (which
will be treated in accordance with _Section 3.10_), will be converted into
and constitute the right to receive cash an amount per share equal to Series
A-1 Preference Amount as defined in and as calculated in accordance with
the Certificate of Designations, without interest (the " _Preferred Merger
Consideration,_ " together with the Common Merger Consideration, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock
that have been converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration as provided in this _Section 3.7(a)_ will no longer be
outstanding and will be canceled and will cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
shares of Company Capital Stock will cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in
exchange therefor.

 

(b) The aggregate number of issued and outstanding shares of Purchaser common
stock (" _Purchaser Common Stock_ ") will be converted into that number of
fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation equal to the aggregate number of Fully Diluted Shares as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



20 3.8. _Exchange of Certificates; Payment of the Merger Consideration_. (a)
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit with the Disbursement Agent
cash in an amount sufficient to allow the Disbursement Agent to make all
payments that may be required pursuant to this _Article III_ (such cash is
referred to as the " _Merger Disbursement Fund_ "). Parent will be obligated
to, from time to time, deposit any additional funds necessary to make all
payments that may be required by this _Article III_. The Disbursement Agent
will deliver the cash payments contemplated to be paid for shares of Company
Capital Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the Merger Disbursement Fund
as contemplated by this Agreement. Except as contemplated by this _Section
3.8_, the Merger Disbursement Fund will not be used for any other purpose.
Amounts of cash in the Merger Disbursement Fund will be invested by the
Disbursement Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such investment or losses thereon will affect the amounts payable to the
holders of shares of Company Capital Stock. Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investments will be payable to Parent.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event more than two Business
Days thereafter, Parent will cause the Disbursement Agent to mail or deliver
to each Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of
record of shares of Company Capital Stock, a (i) form of letter of transmittal
(which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Certificates to the Disbursement Agent) and that will be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent and Company will reasonably specify and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange
for the consideration to which such Person is entitled pursuant to this
_Article III_. Upon surrender to the Disbursement Agent of a Certificate for
cancellation together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Certificate will promptly be provided in exchange therefor cash in the amount
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this  _Article III_ , and the
Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be canceled. No interest will accrue
or be paid with respect to any consideration to be delivered upon surrender of
Certificates.

 

(c) If any cash payment is to be made in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment pays any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making of such
payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such
holder or requesting Person, or will establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Disbursement Agent that such Tax has been paid or is inapplicable.

 



21 (d) There will be no transfers registered at or after the Effective Time on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Common Stock
or Certificates that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or the
Disbursement Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursement Agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursement Agent will, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, pay or cause to be
paid the consideration deliverable in respect of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate pursuant to this _Article III_.

(f) Promptly following the date that is one year after the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation will be entitled to require the Disbursement Agent to
deliver to Parent any portion of the Merger Disbursement Fund which has not
been disbursed to holders of shares of Company Capital Stock (including all
interest and other income received by the Disbursement Agent in respect of
the Merger Disbursement Fund), and thereafter each holder of a Share may
surrender or transfer, as applicable, such Share to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar
laws) receive in consideration therefor the applicable Merger Consideration
into which such shares of Company Capital Stock have been converted pursuant
to _Section 3.7_, without interest, but such holder will have no greater
rights against Parent or the Surviving Corporation than may be accorded to
general creditors of Parent or the Surviving Corporation under applicable law.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 3.8_, none of
the Disbursement Agent, Parent or any party hereto will be liable to a holder
of shares of Company Capital Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

 

3.9. _Stock Awards_. The Company will take the actions specified in _Schedule
3.9_ with respect to all options to purchase Company Common Stock granted
under the Company Stock Plans (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") and each
outstanding Restricted Share Unit issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans
(each, a " _Company Restricted Share Unit_ ").

3.10. _Appraisal Rights_. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Exception Shares) and
that are held by stockholders of the Company who have neither voted in favor
of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who will have demanded
properly in writing appraisal for such shares of Company Capital Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ")
will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the applicable
Merger Consideration (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "). Dissenting
Stockholders

 



22  will be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of the Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except
that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders of the Company who fail to
perfect or who effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal of such
shares under Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance
with _Section 3.7_, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the
manner provided in _Section 3.8_, of the Certificate or Certificates that
formerly evidenced such shares of Company Capital Stock.

(b) The Company will give Parent notice as promptly as reasonably practicable
upon receipt by the Company of any demand for payment pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL and of withdrawals of such notice, and Parent will have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. Any payments to be made in respect of Dissenting Shares will be made

HSR Filing except that, upon notice to the Company, Parent may withdraw its
HSR Filing in the event that counsel to Parent recommends that such action be
taken to avoid a Second Request or the initiation of Agency Litigation, in
which event Parent will refile its HSR Filing (and Parent will pay the fee
required under the HSR Act in respect thereof) within two Business Days of
its withdrawal; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may not voluntarily
withdraw and refile its HSR Filing more than two times without the prior
consent of the Company. Each of Parent and the Company will promptly file
with any Governmental Authority other than the DOJ any other filings, reports,
information and documentation required in order to complete the Transactions
under any Antitrust Laws other than the HSR Act. In the 

 



44  event that the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority requests additional
information (other than pursuant to a Second Request or Agency Litigation,
provision for which is made in _Sections 5.3(b)_ and _5.3(c)_ ), each of the
Parties will respond thereto as promptly as practicable.

(b) Each of the Parties hereto will (i) furnish to each others counsel such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other counsel may
request in good faith in connection with its preparation of any filing or
submission to any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act and any other
Antitrust Laws (including the HSR Filing), (ii) give the other Parties prompt
notice of any so-called "second request" for information by the DOJ pursuant
to 16 C.F.R. §§ 801, _et seq._ (a " _Second Request_ ") or any legal or other
proceeding by or before any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transactions (" _Agency Litigation_ "), and respond as promptly as practicable
thereto with the objective of causing the Effective Time to occur as promptly
as practicable, (iii) promptly inform the other Parties of any communication
with any Governmental Authority regarding any Second Request, Agency
Litigation or the Transactions and keep the other Parties informed on a
current basis as to the status of any such matter, (iv) consult and cooperate
with each other in connection with any analysis, appearance, discussion,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Authority in connection with any proceeding or
communication relating to the Transactions, and (v) to the extent practicable,
except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any legal
requirement, permit authorized representatives of the other Party to be
present at each meeting or conference or telephone call with any
representative of a Governmental Authority relating to any such proceeding and
to have access to any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Authority in connection with any such proceeding.

(c) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding
(including Agency Litigation) is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
by a Governmental Authority or private party challenging the Transactions,
each of the Parties will cooperate in all material respects with each other
and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Transactions or delays the Effective Time past the
Termination Date (collectively, an " _Injunction_ ");  _provided_ , _however_
, that notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including in
this _Article V_ , (i) Parent will be entitled to direct the defense of any
legal, administrative or judicial action or proceeding in respect of the
Transactions, or negotiations with any Governmental Authority or other Person
relating thereto, including in respect of any regulatory filings under
applicable Antitrust Laws, (ii) the Company will not make any offer,
acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise engage in negotiations or
discussions with any Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to
any proposed settlement, stay, toll, extension of any waiting period, consent
decree, commitment or remedy, or, in the event of litigation, discovery,
admissibility of evidence, timing or scheduling, except as specifically
requested by or agreed with Parent or its counsel,

 



45  and (iii) the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
provide full and effective support of Parent and its counsel in all such
negotiations and discussions with representatives of any Governmental
Authority or other Person to the extent requested by counsel to Parent. Each
of the Parties may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other pursuant
to this _Section 5.3_ as "Outside Counsel Only Material" and may redact from
any information provided to the other party and its counsel any references to
such partys valuation of the other party.

 

(d) Each of the Parties hereto shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain promptly (and in any event no later than the Termination Date) any
clearance required under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws for the
consummation of the Transactions, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to
avoid or eliminate any impediment under any Antitrust Law, or regulation or
rule, that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority, or any other Person,
with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the Effective Time to occur
expeditiously (and in any event no later than the Termination Date), (iii) use
its reasonable best efforts to defend through Agency Litigation or, if
applicable, other litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court,
administrative tribunal or hearing that the Transactions would violate any
applicable law, or any regulation or rule of any Governmental Authority, in
order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Injunction,
(iv) cause its respective inside and outside counsel to cooperate in good
faith with counsel and other representatives of each other party hereto and
use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate and expedite the identification
and resolution of any such issues and, consequently, the expiration of the
applicable HSR Act waiting period and the waiting periods under any other
Antitrust Laws at the earliest practicable dates (and in any event no later
than the Termination Date).

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
including any covenant in this _Article V_, Parent and its Subsidiaries will
not be required to commit to any divestiture, license, hold separate or other
commitment, undertaking or arrangement, and the Company may not commit or
offer to commit to any divestiture, license, hold separate or
other commitment, undertaking or agreement, with respect to assets or conduct
of business arrangements (whether in respect of the Company, Parent or any of
their respective subsidiaries) as a condition to obtaining any approval from
any Governmental Authority for any reason. For the avoidance of doubt, the
covenants in this _Section 5.3_ will constitute the Parties sole obligations
with respect to efforts to obtain approvals of Governmental Authorities.

 

5.4. _Stockholder Approvals_. (a) If required by applicable law in order to
consummate the Merger, the Company, acting through the Company Board, will,
in accordance with applicable law and the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an
annual or special meeting of its stockholders, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following consummation of the Offer for the purpose of
considering and taking action on this Agreement and the Merger (such meeting,
or any adjournments or postponements thereof, the " _Stockholders 
Meeting_"). At the Stockholders Meeting or any postponement or

 



46  adjournment thereof, Parent and Purchaser will vote, or will cause, all
shares of Company Capital Stock then owned by them and their respective
Subsidiaries to be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and to
deliver or provide, in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company, any other
approvals that are required pursuant to applicable law, regulations or the
rules of the SEC or Nasdaq to effect the Transactions.

 

(b) Following the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if applicable,
Parent and Purchaser will cause the Merger to become effective as promptly as
practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Purchaser
acquires shares of Capital Stock representing at least 90% of the voting power
of the then outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the Offer
and the Preferred Share Sale, exercise of the Top-Up Option or otherwise in
accordance with this Agreement, the Parties will take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective, in accordance with
Section 253 of the DGCL, as promptly as practicable after such acquisition
without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company.

5.5.  _Proxy Statement; Information Statement_. If approval of the Companys
stockholders is required by applicable law to consummate the Merger, promptly
following consummation of the Offer, the Company will file the Proxy Statement
with the SEC under the Exchange Act and use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC promptly. Each of the Company,
Parent and Purchaser agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, after
consultation with the other Parties, to respond promptly to all comments of
and requests by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and to cause the
Proxy Statement and all required amendments and supplements thereto to be
mailed to the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock entitled to vote at
the Stockholders Meeting at the earliest practicable time.

5.6. _Press Releases_. The initial press release announcing this Agreement
will be in substantially the form previously agreed to by the Parties. Parent
and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will
consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to the
Offer, the Merger or this Agreement and will not issue any such press release
without the prior written consent of the other Party, which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party may,
without the prior consent of the other Party (but after prior consultation, to
the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances), issue any such press
release as such partys legal counsel advises is required by applicable
law, securities exchange or Nasdaq rules. Parent and Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will cooperate to develop all public
communications and make appropriate members of management available at
presentations related to the Transactions as reasonably requested by the
other Party.

5.7. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. (a) From the date of this
Agreement until the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable
laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company will (and will
cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parent and Parents Representatives such
access during normal business hours to the

 



47  books, records (including Tax Returns and work papers of independent
auditors) and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may
reasonably request; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such access may not
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
All requests for such access will be made to such agents of the Company as the
Company may designate, who will be solely responsible for coordinating all
such requests and all access permitted hereunder. Neither Parent, Purchaser
nor any of their respective Representatives will contact any of the employees,
customers, landlords, licensors or suppliers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions, whether in person or by
telephone, mail or other means of communication, without the specific prior
written authorization of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to afford access or
disclose information that would jeopardize attorney-client privilege,
contravene any binding agreement with any third party or violate any law or
regulation. The Parties will make reasonable appropriate substitute
arrangements in circumstances where the previous sentence applies.

(b) Each Party and their Representatives will hold any information provided
in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions confidential and any
such information will be deemed to be "Confidential Information" under the
Confidentiality Agreement, which Agreement will continue to be in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms.

5.8. _No Solicitation_. (a) From the date hereof until the Acceptance Date or
the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the
Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective officers, directors or employees, will, and that it will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective other
Representatives not to (and will not authorize or give permission to its and
their respective Representatives to), directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate, seek or knowingly encourage the making, submission or announcement
of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any nonpublic information regarding
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with or in
response to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) continue or otherwise engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) except in connection with a Company Change
of Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.8(e)_, approve, endorse or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or (v) except in connection with a Company
Change of Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.8(e)_, enter into any letter
of intent, arrangement, agreement or understanding relating to any
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 5.8(a)_
will not prohibit (A) the Company Board or any committee thereof, directly or
indirectly through any officer, employee or Representative, prior to the
Acceptance Date, from furnishing nonpublic information regarding the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to, or entering into or participating in
discussions or negotiations with, any Person in response to an unsolicited,
bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board or any committee thereof
concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal if (1) the Company Board thereof concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action with respect to such Acquisition Proposal 

 



48  would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law, (2) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a
breach of this _Section 5.8_, (3) prior thereto the Company has given Parent
the notice required by _Section 5.8(b)_, and (4) the Company furnishes any
nonpublic information provided to the maker of the Acquisition Proposal only
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement between the Company and such Person
containing customary terms and conditions that in the aggregate are not
materially less restrictive than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement or (B) the Company from complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to any Acquisition Proposal,
including any so called "stop, look and listen" communications, or making any
other statement or disclosure that the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the
Company to make such statement or disclosure would reasonably be expected to
be a violation of applicable law; _provided_ that the Company Board may make
a Company Change of Recommendation only in accordance with _Section 5.8(e)_.

(b) The Company will promptly, and in no event later than 24 hours after its
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal, advise Parent orally and in writing of such Acquisition
Proposal or request (including providing the identity of the Person making or
submitting such Acquisition Proposal or request, and, (i) if it is in writing,
a copy of such Acquisition Proposal and any related draft agreements and (ii)
if oral, a reasonably detailed summary thereof that is made or submitted by
any Person during the period between the date hereof and the Closing Date).
The Company will keep Parent informed on a prompt basis with respect to any
change to the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (and in no
event later than 24 hours following any such change), including providing
Parent with a copy of any draft agreements and modifications thereof.

 

(c) Upon the execution of this Agreement, the Company will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors and employees,
and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives and any Person that relate to any
Acquisition Proposal and use reasonable best efforts to obtain the prompt
return or destruction of any confidential information previously furnished to
such Persons with respect thereto within 12 months prior to the date hereof
(to the extent that the Company has the right to cause such Persons to return
or destroy such confidential information under a confidentiality agreement (or
other similar agreement) with such Persons).

(d) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 5.8(e)_, the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) may not (i) withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw or modify, the Company Board Recommendation in a
manner adverse to Parent or make any statement, filing or release, in
connection with obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval or otherwise,
inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing set forth in clauses
(i) and (ii), a " _Company Change of Recommendation_ "), or (iii) enter into
a written agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal.

 



49 (e) The Company Board may at any time prior to the earlier of the Acceptance
Date or receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (i) effect a Company
Change of Recommendation in respect of an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) if it
elects to do so in connection with or following a Company Change of
Recommendation, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ in
order to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for an
Acquisition Proposal, if and only if: (A) an Acquisition Proposal is made to
the Company by a third party, such offer is not withdrawn and the Company has
not breached this _Section 5.8_, (B) the Company Board or any committee
thereof determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor that such offer constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C)
following consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board or any
committee thereof determines that failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law, (D) the Company provides Parent three Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action (such three-Business
Day period, the " _Notice Period_ "), which notice will include
the information with respect to such Superior Proposal that is specified in
_Section 5.8(b)_ (it being understood that any material revision or amendment
to the terms of such Superior Proposal will require a new notice and, in such
case, all references to three Business Days in this _Section 5.8(e)_ will be
deemed to be two Business Days), (E) at the end of the Notice Period described
in clause (D), the Company Board again makes the determination in good faith
after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor (after
negotiating in good faith with Parent and its Representatives if requested by
Parent during the Notice Period regarding any adjustments or modifications to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and taking into account any
such adjustments or modifications) that the Acquisition Proposal continues to
be a Superior Proposal and, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in
a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (F) the Company has
paid the Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 8.3_.

 

(f) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective
Time, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries may terminate, amend,
modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality agreement to which it is
a party relating to a proposed business combination involving the Company or
any standstill agreement to which it is a party unless the Company Board
or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
During such period, the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, will
enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the provisions
of any such agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any
breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof in each case except to the extent that the Company Board or
any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that taking such action would be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

 



50 5.9. _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, no Party will take any action that would cause the Transactions (a) to
be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them will
take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) such Transactions from, or if necessary challenge the
validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter
in effect and (b) not to comply with any Takeover Provisions and each of them
will take all necessary steps within its control to make such Transactions
comply with (or continue to comply with) any Takeover Provisions.

 

5.10. _No Control of the Company s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement will give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Appointment
Time. Prior to the Appointment Time, the Company will exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

5.11. _Limitation on Transfers_. From and after the date on which Parent or
Purchaser acquires shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the terms
hereof or the Shareholder Agreement through the earliest of the termination of
this Agreement or the Effective Time, neither Parent nor Purchaser may
transfer, sell, assign or otherwise dispose of such shares of Company Capital
Stock (or any rights, including voting rights, with respect to such shares of
Company Capital Stock), other than to Parents financing sources
in connection with Parents financing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (provided that in any event Purchaser shall retain sole power
to vote such shares of Company Capital Stock).

 

VI. _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS_

6.1. _Indemnification_. (a) The Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company or
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or former directors,
officers and employees, as the case may be, of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in effect immediately prior to the date
of this Agreement or, subject to the prior approval of Parent, after the date
of this Agreement, and any indemnification provisions under the Company
Constituent Documents or the comparable charter or organizational documents of
any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof, in each case to the
extent permitted by applicable law, and will not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any such provision in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
of such indemnitee thereunder for any acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will endeavor to enter into a
directors and officers liability insurance policy covering those Persons
who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, are covered by the
Companys directors and 

 



51  officers liability insurance policy (the " _Insured Parties_ ") on terms no
less favorable to the Insured Parties than those of the Companys present
directors and officers liability insurance policy (such policy, a "
_Company D andO Policy_"), for a period of seven years after the Effective Time.
If the Company is unable to obtain such a Company DandO Policy prior to the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in
effect, for a period of seven years after the Closing Date, a Company DandO
Policy with a creditworthy issuer; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
will Parent be required to expend annually more than 250% of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (the approximate
amount of which is set forth on _Section 6.1(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule)
and, if the cost for such coverage is in excess of such amount, Parent will
be required only to maintain the maximum amount of coverage as is reasonably
available for 250% of such annual premium.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other entity
and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its assets to any
other entity, then and in each such case, Parent will, as a condition
precedent to the consummation of any such transaction, cause proper provision
to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.1_.

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 6.1_ will not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any indemnitee and/or Insured Party to whom this _Section
6.1_ applies without the express written consent of such affected indemnitee
and Insured Party. It is expressly agreed that the indemnitees and/or Insured
Parties to whom this _Section 6.1_ applies will be third party beneficiaries
of this _Section 6.1_.

(e) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will, and Parent will
cause them to, honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained herein. The rights of each indemnitee and/or Insured Party
hereunder will be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other
rights such Person may have under the Company Constituent Documents or the
comparable charter or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the
Company, or any other indemnification arrangement.

 

6.2. _Employee Matters_. (a) It is Parents and the Companys intention that,
for a period of one year following the Effective Time, individuals who are
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time and continue to be employed by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, following the Effective
Time (each, a " _Post-Merger Employee_ ") will be provided with salaries and
benefits that are in the aggregate approximately equal to the salaries and
benefits (other than equity compensation) they received prior to
the Effective Time, it being understood that Parent will review the salaries
and benefits of its and its Subsidiaries employees from time to time in order
to determine the most appropriate way to compensate and incentivize Post-
Merger Employees, and accordingly may make such changes in the compensation
and benefits that Parent determines to be in the best interests of Parent from
time to time.

 



52 (b) It is Parents and the Companys intention that, each Post-Merger
Employee will be given credit for all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors under any employee benefit plan
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, including
any such plans providing vacation, sick pay, severance and retirement
benefits maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries in which such Post-Merger
Employees participate for purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to
benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but not
for accrual of pension benefits), to the extent past service was recognized
for such Post-Merger Employees under the comparable plan immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
6.2_ will be construed to require crediting of service that would result in
(i) duplication of benefits or (ii) service credit for benefit accruals under
a defined benefit pension plan.

 

(c) In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to Post-Merger
Employees following the Effective Time, it is Parents and the Companys
intention that Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to cause (i) the
waiver of all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Post-Merger Employees (and their eligible dependents) under
any welfare benefit plans in which Post-Merger Employees participate following
the Effective Time, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or
waiting periods would not apply in the absence of such change, and (ii) for
the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, the crediting of each Post-
Merger Employee (or his or her eligible dependents) with any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to any such change in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements after such change.

(d) Nothing in this _Section 6.2_, express or implied, will confer upon any
Post-Merger Employee, or any legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any
rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment
for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 6.2_, express or
implied, will be construed to prevent Parent from terminating or modifying to
any extent or in any respect any benefit plan that Parent may establish or
maintain. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
6.2_, nothing contained in this Agreement will be treated as an amendment to
any employee benefit plan or creation of an employee benefit plan.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all actions necessary
to cause the account balance of each participant in the Online Resources
Corporation 401(k) Retirement Plan to become fully vested as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

6.3. _Board of Directors; Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. (a) Subject to
applicable law, effective upon the later to occur of the purchase by Purchaser
of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the purchase of the Preferred Shares
pursuant to the

 



53  Shareholder Agreement (the " _Appointment Time_ "), a number of Purchasers
designees will be elected to the Company Board as set forth in this _Section
6.3_. Purchaser will be entitled to designate up to such number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as will give
Purchaser representation on the Company Board equal to the product of the
total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the
directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that
the aggregate number of votes represented by Shares and Preferred Shares
beneficially owned by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser following such
purchase bears to the total number of votes represented by Shares and
Preferred Shares then outstanding, and the Company will, at such time,
promptly take all actions necessary to cause Purchasers designees to be
elected as directors of the Company, including securing the resignations of
incumbent directors (except as set forth in the last sentence of this _Section
6.3(a)_). At such time, the persons designated by Purchaser will, as nearly as
practicable, constitute at least the same percentage as persons designated by
Purchaser will constitute of the Company Board of (i) each committee of the
Company Board, (ii) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company,
and (iii) each committee of each such board, in each case only to the extent
permitted by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the
Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
(A) at least a majority of the Company Board and each committee of the Company
Board and such boards and committees of the Companys Subsidiaries, as of the
date hereof, who are not employees of the Company remain members of the
Company Board and of such boards and committees and (B) a majority of the
Company Board is independent as required by the relevant rules of Nasdaq (such
directors, the " _Continuing Directors_ "). 

(b) Subject to applicable law, the Company will promptly take all actions
required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 6.3_,
and will include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information as is required under
such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to fulfill such obligations. Parent or
Purchaser will supply to the Company, and be solely responsible for, any
information with respect to either of them and their nominees, officers,
directors and Affiliates required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Purchasers designees pursuant to
_Section 6.3(a)_ and prior to the Effective Time, any action by the Company
with respect to any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of any term
of this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any
extension of time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement, any waiver of compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions under this Agreement that are for the benefit
of the Company, any amendment to the Company Constituent Document or material
modification of any Company Stock Plan, any authorization of an agreement
between the Company and any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent,
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, any exercise of
the Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement and any action to seek
to enforce any obligation of Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement (or any

of the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock other than Parent or
Purchaser) may only be authorized by, and will require the authorization of,
a majority of the Continuing Directors (or by the Continuing Director should
there be only one). For purposes of considering any matter set forth in this
_Section 6.3(c)_, the Continuing Directors will be permitted to meet without
the presence of the other directors. The Continuing Directors will have the
authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the
Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined by
the Continuing Directors and will have the authority to institute any action
on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement or any of
the Companys rights hereunder. The Company shall indemnify and advance
expenses to, and Parent shall cause the Company to indemnify and advance
expenses to, the Continuing Directors in connection with their service as
directors of the Company to the extent permitted by the Company Constituent
Documents and in accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.1_ hereof.

6.4. _Obligations or Purchaser_ : Parent will take all action necessary
to cause Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt and
faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of the
obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of Purchaser under
this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, including any such
obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertaking that are required
to be performed, discharged or complied with following the Effective Time.

VII. _CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER_

7.1. _Conditions to Each Party s Obligation to Effect the Merger_. The
respective obligation of each Party to consummate the Merger is subject to
the fulfillment or written waiver by the Parties before the Effective Time of
each of the following conditions:

(a) _Stockholder Approval_. If and to the extent required by the DGCL, this
Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions shall have been approved and
adopted by the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock;

(b) _No Order_. No Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued,
promulgated, enforced or entered any law, rule, regulation, injunction, order,
decree or ruling (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is then in
effect and has the effect of making the acquisition of shares of Company
Capital Stock by Parent or Purchaser or any Affiliate of either of them
illegal or otherwise restricting, preventing or prohibiting consummation of
the Transactions; and

 

(c) _Purchase of Shares_. The Acceptance Date shall have occurred and
Purchaser shall have accepted for payment and paid for Shares (in each case
to the extent validly tendered and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer.

 



55 VIII. _TERMINATION_

 

8.1. _Termination_. Except as set forth in the proviso at the end of this
_Section 8.1_, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time and the Transactions may be abandoned for any reason provided
in _Sections 8.1(a)_ through _8.1(h)_ below:

(a) By mutual written consent of each of Parent and the Company,
notwithstanding any adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company;

 

(b) By either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order,
decree or ruling (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that has become
final and nonappealable and has the effect of making consummation of the Offer
or the Merger illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of
the Offer or the Merger; _provided_ that the Party seeking to terminate this
Agreement shall have used its reasonable best efforts to remove or lift such
injunction, order, decree or ruling;

 

(c) By Parent if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or any
of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part
of the Company, which breach is not cured within 30 days following written
notice by Parent to the Company, or which breach Parent in good faith
determines, by its nature or timing, is incapable of being cured prior to
the consummation of the Offer;

(d) By the Company if Parent or Purchaser fails to commence the Offer within
20 Business Days of the date hereof;

(e) By Parent or the Company if (i) the Offer expires pursuant to its terms
without any Shares being purchased thereunder as a result of the failure to
satisfy one or more conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex A_ or (ii) the
Acceptance Date shall not have occurred prior to July 31, 2013 (the "
_Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(e)_ will not be available to any Party
to the extent that such Partys failure to comply with any provision of
this Agreement, has resulted in the failure of any of the conditions set
forth on _Annex A_ to be satisfied prior to the Termination Date;

(f) By the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, in order to
enter into a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such termination will be effective, and the Company may
not enter into any commitment with respect to any Superior Proposal, unless
prior thereto the Company has complied with all of its covenants hereunder,
including _Sections 5.8_ and _8.3_ ; it being understood that the Company may
enter into any agreement providing for a Superior Proposal simultaneously with
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(f)_ and
payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section 8.3(b)_ (
_provided_ that Parent shall have provided wiring instructions for such
payment following a request in writing by the Company or, if not, then such
payment shall be paid promptly following delivery of such instructions);

 



56 (g) By Parent if (i) the Company Board shall have withdrawn or materially
modified the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, (ii)
the Company shall have entered into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) the Company Board shall have resolved to do any
of the foregoing; or 

(h) By the Company if there shall have been a material breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth
in this Agreement on the part of Purchaser or Parent, which breach is not
cured within 30 days following written notice by the Company to Parent, or
which breach the Company in good faith determines, by its nature or timing,
is incapable of being cured prior to the consummation of the Offer;

_provided_ , _however_ , that from and after the Acceptance Date, then none
of Parent, Purchaser or the Company may terminate this Agreement or abandon
the Merger pursuant to _Sections 8.1(c)_ through _8.1(h)_.

8.2. _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. A Party desiring to
terminate this Agreement must give written notice of such termination to the
other Party, specifying the provision pursuant to which such termination is
effective. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in
_Section 8.1_, this Agreement will be of no further force and effect, except
(i) each of _Section 8.1_, this  _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and _Article
IX_ will survive the termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein
will relieve any Party from liability for any breach of this Agreement
occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement that was committed
intentionally by the breaching party or resulted from the breaching partys
gross negligence. No termination of this Agreement will affect the obligations
of the Parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which
obligations will survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

 

8.3. _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Other than as specifically provided in this
_Section 8.3_ or otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties hereto, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions will be paid by the Party incurring such costs or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 

(b) The Company will pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee if this
Agreement is terminated as follows:

 

(i) the Company will pay to Parent the entire Company Termination Fee within
five Business Days following termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_, or

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated (1) by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)_ or (2) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ or _Section
8.1(f)_; and (B) an Acquisition Proposal (including a previously communicated
Acquisition Proposal) shall have been publicly announced or otherwise
communicated to a member of senior management of the

 



57  Company or the Board (or any Person shall have publicly announced or
communicated a bona fide intention, whether or not conditional, to make an
Acquisition Proposal) at any time prior to the date of termination, and (C)
if within nine months after the date of such termination, the Company enters
into a definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, any Acquisition
Proposal, then (upon the satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in
clauses (A) through (C) of this _Section 8.3(b)(ii))_, the Company will pay
to Parent the Company Termination Fee prior to entering into any definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with  _Section
8.1(f)_ or simultaneously with the Company entering into such definitive
agreement, or, if applicable, consummating such transaction; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_, (y) the
references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "10%" will instead be
deemed to refer to "a majority" and (z) references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to a merger, consolidation, other business combination,
reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall reference
only such a transaction involving the Company pursuant to which the
Company stockholders immediately preceding such transaction hold securities
representing less than a majority of the total outstanding voting power of the
surviving or resulting entity in such transaction.

 

(c) All amounts paid pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ will be by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account directed by the Party hereto
entitled to payment. Each Party hereto agrees that the agreements contained in
this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that,
without these agreements, the other Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if any Party fails promptly to pay any amounts due
under this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, the other
Party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Party failing
to pay for such amounts, then the Party failing to pay such amounts will pay
interest on such amounts from the date payment of such amounts was due to the
date of actual payment at the prime rate of the Citibank, N.A. in effect on
the date such payment was due, together with the reasonable, documented out-
of-pocket costs and expenses of the Party seeking collection (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with such suit.

 

(d) The payment of the Company Termination Fee, if paid under the
circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is payable under _Section
8.3(b)_, will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Purchaser against
the Company and its Affiliates in respect of any claims arising from, or in
connection with, the termination of this Agreement under such circumstances;
_provided_ , _however_ , the payment of the Company Termination Fee will not
relieve any Party from liability for breach of this Agreement occurring prior
to the termination of this Agreement or Parents rights under  _Section 9.5_
arising from any such breach.

(a) waived by the Party benefited by the provision, but only in writing, or

in the same manner as this Agreement, except to the extent that any such
amendment would violate applicable law or require submission or resubmission
of this Agreement or the Merger contemplated hereby to the stockholders of the
Company.

 

9.3. _Counterparts; Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement may be executed
in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to constitute an
original, and transmission of a duly executed counterpart hereof by electronic
means will be deemed to constitute delivery of an executed original manual
counterpart hereof.

 

9.4. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue_. This Agreement and the agreements,
instruments and documents contemplated hereby and all disputes between the
Parties under or relating to this Agreement or the facts and circumstances
leading to its execution and delivery, whether in contract, tort or otherwise,
will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to conflict of laws principles that would
result in the application of the law of any other State. The Delaware Court of
Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any
Delaware state court and the Federal court of the United States of America
sitting in the State of Delaware) will have exclusive jurisdiction over any
and all disputes among the Parties, whether at law or in equity, based upon,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the agreements, instruments
and documents contemplated hereby or the facts and circumstances leading to
its execution and delivery, whether in contract, tort or otherwise. Each of
the Parties irrevocably consents to and agrees to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts, agrees that process may be served upon them in
any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware, and hereby waives,
and agrees not to assert in any such dispute, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, any claim that (a) such Party is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of such courts, (b) such Party and such Partys property is
immune from any legal process issued by such courts or (c) any litigation
commenced in such courts is brought in an inconvenient forum.

9.5. _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in

 



59  accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Subject to
_Section 5.2(d)_, each Party agrees that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by any other Party of any covenant or obligation contained
in this Agreement, the non-breaching Party will be entitled (in addition to
any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity,
including monetary damages) to (a) a decree or order of specific performance
to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and
(b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. Each Party
further agrees that no other Party or any other Person will be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or other form of security in connection with
or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.5_,
and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other form of security.

9.6. _Disclosure Schedule_. Before entry into this Agreement, the Company
delivered to Parent and Purchaser a schedule (the " _Disclosure Schedule_ ")
setting forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary
or appropriate either (a) in response to an express disclosure requirement
contained in a provision hereof or (b) as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in _Section 4.2_ or to one or more of
the Companys covenants contained in  _Article V_. The Disclosure Schedule
constitutes an integral part of this Agreement and is attached hereto as
_Schedule A_ and is hereby incorporated herein. There may be included in the
Disclosure Schedule and elsewhere in this Agreement items and information
that are not "material," and such inclusion will not be deemed to be an
acknowledgment or agreement that any such item or information (or any non-
disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance) is
"material" and will not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms
"material," "materially," "materiality" or any word or phrase of similar
import used herein. Matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedule are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be disclosed in
the Disclosure Schedule. No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule relating to
a possible breach or violation of any contract, law or order of any
Governmental Authority will be construed as an admission or indication that
such breach or violation exists or has occurred. Any disclosures in the
Disclosure Schedule that refer to a document are qualified in their entirety
by reference to the text of such document, including all amendments,
exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto. Any capitalized term used
in the Disclosure Schedule and not otherwise defined therein has the meaning
given to such term in this Agreement. Any headings set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule are for convenience of reference only and do not affect
the meaning or interpretation of any of the disclosures set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule. The disclosure of any matter in any section of
the Disclosure Schedule will be deemed to be a disclosure by the Company to
each other section of the Disclosure Schedule to which such disclosures
relevance is reasonably apparent on its face. The listing of any matter on the
Disclosure Schedule shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission
by such party, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material, is
required to be disclosed by such party under this Agreement or falls within
relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this
Agreement. In no event shall the listing of any matter in the Disclosure
Schedule be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of such the Companys
representations, warranties and/or covenants set forth in this Agreement.

 



60 9.7. _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications given or made
under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed given when
personally delivered or transmitted by facsimile or e-mail transmission (with
confirmation of successful transmission) to the persons, addresses and/or

unenforceable, will remain in full force and effect and will in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal

adverse to any Party. Upon any such determination, the Parties will negotiate
in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute
provision to effect the original intent of the Parties.

void. Subject to the preceding sentences of this _Section 9.10_, this

the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

9.11. _No Recourse_. No past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, individual stockholder, agent, attorney or
representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries has or will have any
liability for any liability or obligation of the Company under this Agreement
or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of the Transactions.

 

9.12. _Headings_. The table of contents and Section headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and do not limit or otherwise
affect any of the substance of this Agreement.

9.13. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, AND WHETHER MADE BY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, THIRD PARTY CLAIM
OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER

 



62  PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.13_.

_CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser will not be

to any such rules or regulations) Purchaser may, but only to the extent
expressly permitted by this Agreement, delay the acceptance for payment for,
or the payment for, any Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn,

(a) unless, at the expiration of the Offer (as extended from time to time, if
applicable):

(i) there shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn a number of
Shares that, together with any other shares of Company Capital Stock
beneficially owned by Parent or its Subsidiaries and the Shares to be acquired
by Purchaser or the Company pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement,
constitutes a majority of all the Fully Diluted Shares of the Company on the
date of Purchasers initial purchase of Shares in the Offer (the " _Minimum

(ii) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall have expired or
been terminated;

 

(iii) any approval or consent of any Governmental Authority that is necessary
for the Transactions to be consummated in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, or any relevant statutory, regulatory or other governmental waiting
periods, whether domestic, foreign or supranational, the failure of which to
be obtained or to be in full force and effect or to have expired, as
applicable, would, upon the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer, have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, shall have been obtained or be in
full force and effect or shall have expired, as applicable, or

 

(b) if, at the expiration of the Offer (as extended), any of the following
conditions shall occur and be continuing: 

(i) (A) any of the Specified Reps shall not be true and correct at and as of
the date of this Agreement or the Acceptance Date as though made at and as of
the Acceptance Date or (B) any of the other representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct at and
as of the date of this Agreement or the Acceptance Date as though made at and
as of the Acceptance Date (except to the extent expressly made as of an
earlier date, in which case solely as of such date), in each instance in this
clause (B), except as has not had a Material Adverse Effect on the Company;
or

 



Annex A-1  (ii) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in any
material respect with any of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement
to be performed or complied with prior to the Acceptance Date; or

(iii) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;
or

(iv) a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; or

(v) Purchaser and the Company shall have mutually agreed that Purchaser shall
terminate the Offer or postpone the acceptance for payment of Shares
thereunder; or

(vi) a Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any law, rule, regulation, injunction, order, decree or
ruling (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is then in effect
and has the effect of making the acquisition of shares of Company Capital
Stock by Parent or Purchaser or any Affiliate of either of them illegal or
otherwise restricting, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the
Transactions; or

(vii) there shall be any action, suit, claim, litigation or proceeding by or
on behalf of any Governmental Authority pending or threatened in writing
against the Company, Parent or Purchaser or any of their respective officers
or directors, that could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect
the ability of Parent to own or control the Company or to consummate the
Transactions or seeks to enjoin any of the Transactions or obtain damages
therefrom and which Parents Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with counsel, is or could reasonably be expected to be of
material adverse significance; or

(viii) (A) the Company shall publish or become obligated to publish a press
release or file or become obligated to file a report with the SEC to the
effect that the Companys prior financial statements or reports filed with the
SEC may no longer be relied upon, except arising from or related to the
matters described in Part B of the Disclosure Schedule, (B) the Company or
any of its directors or executive officers shall be named as a party to any
criminal proceeding or become the target of any grand jury or other
investigation of possible criminal conduct where such conduct relates to the
business of the Company, (C) if the Acceptance Date has not occurred prior to
March 18, 2013, the Company shall have failed to deliver to Purchaser its
audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012, and the related
audited consolidated statements of

 



2  operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income (loss) and cash
flows for the year ended December 31, 2012, together with the report and
opinion thereon of KPMG LLP (or another independent public accounting firm
reasonably acceptable to Parent) that satisfies the requirements of Rule 2-02
of Regulation S-X of the Exchange Act, which report and opinion (x) shall be
prepared in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and (y)
shall not contain any qualification or exception as to the scope of such
audit, except from or related to the matters described in Part D of the
Disclosure Schedule, or (D) if the Acceptance Date has not occurred prior to
May 10, 2013, the Company shall have failed to deliver to Purchaser its
unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2013, and the related
unaudited consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity
and comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for the three-month period
ended March 31, 2013. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conditions set forth
in clauses (A), (C) and (D) of this paragraph (viii) will not apply with
respect to any such determination or failure to deliver arising from or
related to the matters described in Part D of the Disclosure Schedule.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and Parent and
may be asserted by Purchaser or Parent regardless of the circumstances giving
rise to any such condition, in whole or in part at any applicable time or from
time to time in their sole discretion prior to the Acceptance Date, except
that the conditions relating to receipt of any approvals from any Governmental
Authority may be asserted at any time prior to the acceptance for payment of
Shares, and all conditions (except for the Minimum Condition) may be waived
by Parent or Purchaser in their sole discretion in whole or in part at any
applicable time or from time to time, in each case subject to the terms and
conditions of the Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC. The failure of Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such
right will be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time prior to the Acceptance Date. Further, the conditions
set forth on this _Annex A_ shall not apply with respect to "subsequent
offering periods," as such term is defined in, and in accordance with, Rule
14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act and effected pursuant to _Section
2.1(c)_ of the Agreement.

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ and not otherwise defined will have
the respective meanings assigned thereto in this Agreement.
