 _(b)_

 

 _Applicable Mechanics_. 

 

(i)

 

Following the date of this Agreement and prior to five (5) Business Days
before the Closing Date, the Foundation will conduct a survey of the
Management Employees holding depositary receipts issued by the Foundation who
have not entered into Management Term Sheets as of such date to determine
which such participants (i) elect to enter into the Management Term Sheet and
receive the cash and stock consideration described therein (the " _Management
Election_ ") or (ii) receive consideration in respect of their allocable
portion of the Shares to be sold by the Foundation in the same cash and stock
proportions to be determined in accordance with _Schedule 2.3_ (the " _Non-
Election Allocation_ "). The Foundation shall inform Buyer at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date of the results of the survey,
including the Management Employees who made Management Elections and the
aggregate number of shares of Buyer Common Stock elected to be received by the
Management Employees making Management Elections in lieu of that portion of
cash consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive in connection
with the transactions hereunder in the absence of making such election (such
shares, the " _Management Election Shares_ "). _Section 2.3(b)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of each of the Management
Employees who has entered into a Management Term Sheet as of the date hereof
(the " _Management Term Sheet List_ "). Lux Seller or the Foundation shall
provide Buyer with an updated Management Term Sheet List not later than three
(3) Business Days after any Management Employee enters into a Management Term
Sheet, together with a schedule of estimated payments by amount and
consideration type.

 

(ii)

 

No later than thirty (30) days following the date hereof, Buyer shall deliver
to Seller a proposed amount of the US Purchase Price (the "Proposed US
Purchase Price"). Seller will review such Proposed US Purchase Price and, if
within five (5) days after the receipt of such Proposed US Purchase Price,
Seller has not informed Buyer of any disagreement with the Proposed US
Purchase Price, the Proposed US Purchase Price shall become the US Purchase
Price. If Seller disagrees with the Proposed US Purchase Price, Seller will
inform Buyer of such disagreement within such five (5) day period. Buyer and
Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such dispute. If Buyer and
Seller fail to agree on the US Purchase Price before the date that is five (5)
days following the receipt of Sellers notice of disagreement, such US
Purchase Price shall be determined within a reasonable time (but in no event
later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) by the Accounting
Firm, which determination must be in writing and based on the fair value of
USco. The US Purchase Price, as agreed upon by Buyer and Seller or determined
by the Accounting Firm under this Section 2.3(c) shall be final and binding
upon Buyer and Seller.

extent that the amounts deposited in the Termination Fee Escrow Account are

Date Net Working Capital minus the Target Net Working Capital ( _provided_ ,
for the avoidance of doubt, if such number is a negative number, the Cash
Component shall be reduced by such amount). The Foundation shall be paid the

(iv)

 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, immediately
subsequent to the other payments set forth in this Section 2.3(c), Buyer shall

2.3_ sets forth the methodology applicable to the determination of Foundation
Cash Amount and Lux Cash Amount as applied using the illustrative amounts set
forth therein.

 

(ii)

 

In the event that the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued to
Sellers exceeds 19.99% of the then-outstanding shares of Buyer Common Stock
(as calculated pursuant to Section 312.03 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual)
(rounded up to the nearest whole number, the " _Excess Shares_ "), then the

€25,000,000 of cash (such amount, the " _Escrow Purchase Price Amount_ ")

clause (ii) below minus the amount in sub-clause (B) of clause (ii) below (in
each case valued as of the trading day prior to the Closing using the Dollar
Exchange Rate as of such date) is a positive number, Sellers hereby agree that
an additional amount of cash denominated in Euros equal to such difference
shall be deposited into the Purchase Price Escrow Account (the " _Residual
Cash Escrow Amount_ "), which shall be deposited into a separate escrow
account (the " _Purchase Price Escrow Account_ ") for use as set forth in
_Section 2.3(f)_ , which shall be established pursuant to an escrow agreement
(the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), which Escrow Agreement shall be entered into on
or prior to the Closing Date among Sellers, the Company, Buyer and an escrow

Seller and 20% to the Foundation.

 

(ii)

 

(A) a number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the lesser of (1)
3,602,849 shares of Buyer Common Stock and (B) the amount at which the Lux
Stock Amount is zero (such shares, the " _Stock Escrow Purchase Price Amount_
") in an escrow account (the " _Stock Escrow Purchase Price Account_ ") for
use as set forth in Section 2.3(f), which shall be established pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement and which Stock Escrow Purchase Price Amount shall be
allocated 80% to Lux Seller and 20% to the Foundation; and

 

(iii)

 

3,142,019 shares of Buyer Common Stock (such shares, the " _Stock Escrow Tax

as set forth in Section 9.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, which shall be
established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and which Stock Escrow Tax Amount
shall be allocated 80% to Lux Seller and 20% to the Foundation.

 

 _(f)_

 

 _Determination of the Final Purchase Price_.

 

(i)

 

As soon as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Lux Seller a proposed calculation of
the amount of Closing Date Net Working Capital and Closing Date Indebtedness
(collectively, the " _Proposed Closing Date Calculations_ ") together with
reasonable supporting detail with respect to Buyers calculations. Buyer
agrees to prepare the Proposed Closing Date Calculations in a manner
consistent with the Accounting Principles.

 

(ii)

 

If Lux Seller does not give written notice of dispute (a " _Purchase Price
Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer within sixty (60) days of receiving the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations, Lux Seller and the other Parties agree that the
Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the final
Closing Date Net Working Capital and Closing Date Indebtedness, in each case,
for all purposes hereunder (including, without limitation, the determination
of the Actual Adjustment). Items not disputed by Seller in the Purchase Price
Dispute Notice shall be final and binding upon the Parties. If Seller gives a
Purchase Price

 


  

 

-21-

  Dispute Notice to Buyer within such sixty (60) day period, Buyer and Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the disputed items during
the thirty (30) day period commencing on the date Buyer receives the
applicable Purchase Price Dispute Notice from Seller. If Seller and Buyer do
not agree upon a final resolution with respect to any disputed items within
such thirty (30) day period, then the remaining items in dispute shall be
submitted immediately to Deloitte and Touche LLP (the " _Accounting Firm_ ").
The Accounting Firm shall be required to render a determination of the
applicable dispute within forty five (45) days after referral of the matter to
such Accounting Firm, which determination must be in writing and must set
forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The terms of appointment and
engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be as agreed upon between Seller and
Buyer, and any associated engagement fees shall initially be borne 50 percent
by Seller and 50 percent by Buyer; provided that the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall, upon resolution of the dispute, be borne by Seller and
Buyer in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the
Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by
the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. The Parties shall enter into
an engagement letter with the Accounting Firm, including customary indemnity
and other provisions. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the
Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether there were mathematical errors in
the Proposed Closing Date Calculations or whether the calculations of Closing
Date Net Working Capital and Closing Date Indebtedness were performed in
accordance with the Accounting Principles, and the Accounting Firm is not
entitled to make any other determination with respect to Closing Date Net
Working Capital, including any determination as to whether IFRS was properly
followed in calculating such amount. In connection with the resolution of any
dispute, the Accounting Firm shall have access to all documents, records, work
papers, facilities and personnel necessary to make its determination. The
determination of such Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Parties. Buyer shall revise the Proposed Closing Date Calculations as
appropriate to reflect the resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to
this _Section 2.3(e)(ii)_ , and, as revised, such Proposed Closing Date
Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the Final Net Working Capital and
Final Closing Date Indebtedness, in each case, for all purposes hereunder
(including, without limitation, the determination of the Actual Adjustment).

 

(iii)

 

The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, make its
financial records available to Seller and its accountants and other
representatives at reasonable times during the review by Lux Seller of, and
the resolution of any objections with respect to, the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations.

 _Adjustment to Initial Cash Purchase Price; Manner of Payment of Funds in
Escrow Account_.

 

(i)

 

If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, Buyer shall pay to Seller, an
aggregate cash amount in Euros equal to such positive amount (80% to Lux
Seller and 20% to the Foundation) by wire transfer or delivery of immediately
available funds, in each case, within three Business Days after the date on
which the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital, Final Closing Debt
Indebtedness and Final Assumed Liabilities are determined pursuant to _Section
2.3(e)_ above.

 


  

 

-22-

  (ii)

 

If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then within three Business Days
after the date on which the Final Closing Date Net Work Capital and Final
Closing Debt Indebtedness are finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_
, the Parties shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to Buyer an amount equal to the
absolute value of such negative amount from the Purchase Price Escrow Account
(but not including the Residual Cash Escrow Amount, if any), which shall be
allocated pro rata between Lux Seller, on the one hand, and the Foundation and
its employee participants on the other hand. In the event that the amount due
to Buyer exceeds the amount of the Purchase Price Escrow Account (but not
including the Residual Cash Escrow Amount, if any), Seller shall have the
right to payment of such excess from the Stock Purchase Price Escrow Account,
in which event Lux Seller and Buyer shall deliver joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to Buyer a number
of shares of Buyer Common Stock (valued as of the date of payment based on (A)
the closing price of a share of Buyer Common Stock on the NYSE on the most
recent trading day preceding the date on which payment is made and (B) the
Dollar Exchange Rate on the most recent day on which the Dollar Exchange Rate
is available preceding the date on which payment is made) having a value equal
to the product of such excess and 1.10, which shall be allocated pro rata
between Lux Seller, on the one hand, and the Foundation and its employee
participants on the other hand. In the event that the amount due to Buyer
exceeds the amount of both the Purchase Price Escrow Account and the Stock
Purchase Price Escrow Account, Sellers shall pay such excess to Buyer out of
the Residual Cash Escrow Amount in the Purchase Price Escrow Account which
shall be allocated pro rata between Lux Seller, on the one hand, and the
Foundation and its employee participants, on the other hand and then by
delivering a number of shares of Buyer Common Stock (valued as of the date of
payment based on (i) the closing price of a share of Buyer Common Stock on the
NYSE on the most recent trading day preceding the date on which payment is
made and (ii) the Dollar Exchange Rate on the most recent day on which the
Dollar Exchange Rate is available preceding the date on which payment is made)
having a value equal to the product of such excess and 1.10, _provided,_
_that_ such payments shall be made pro rata between Lux Seller, on the one
hand, and the Foundation and its employee participants, on the other hand, and
furthermore in no event will any Management Employees be obligated to directly
or indirectly through the Foundation deliver shares of Buyer Common Stock to
Buyer pursuant to this clause such that following such delivery the percentage
of such Management Employees total consideration received pursuant to Section
2.3(c) and 2.3(d) which is delivered pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii) is
greater than the percentage of Lux Sellers total consideration received
pursuant to Section 2.3(c) and 2.3(d) which is delivered under this Section
2.3(g)(ii).

 

(iii)

 

After payment of the Actual Adjustment in accordance with this _Section 2.3_
or the determination that no Adjustment Amount is owed to Buyer or at any time
following delivery of the Proposed Closing Date Calculations the amounts in
dispute, if any, are less than the aggregate amounts in the Purchase Price
Escrow Account or the Stock Purchase Price Escrow Account, any remaining
amounts or shares in the Purchase Price Escrow Account and/or the Stock
Purchase Price Escrow Account shall be released to Sellers in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement, first from the Residual Cash Escrow Amount, second from
the remainder of the Stock Purchase Price Escrow Account and then from the
Purchase Price Escrow Account and thereupon Sellers obligations under Section
6.16 shall terminate.

amounts as Buyer or any of the Group Companies is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

 

 _Section 2.5_

 

 _Treatment of Employees_. The Foundation will, as soon as practicable
following the Closing or release of the relevant escrow amounts, take all
actions necessary (a) to distribute the Foundation Cash Amount (i) to the
employee participants of the Foundation (the " _Management Employees_ ") who
have made a Management Election in accordance with such Management Election
and (ii) to the Management Employees who have not made a Management Election
in accordance with the Non-Election Allocation (as corrected at Closing to
reflect actual amounts) and (b) distribute the Foundation Stock Amount (i) to
the Management Employees who have made a Management Election in accordance
with such Management Election to an escrow account for the benefit of such
Management Employees with an escrow agent reasonably acceptable to the Parties
and pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement to be entered into by Buyer
and such escrow agent on terms customary for such an agreement and (ii) to the
Management Employees who have not made a Management Election in accordance
with the Lux Allocation.

 

 _Section 2.6_

 

 _Adjustment to Consideration_. If at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Buyer shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Stock Component
shall be equitably adjusted to provide Sellers the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, _provided_ , _that_
nothing in this _Section 2.7(b)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any
Party to effect any such change that is not otherwise authorized or permitted
pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 401(a) of the Code (" _Qualified Plans_ "). The Internal Revenue

Subsidiaries, and (z) agreeing to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate, or

 _Section 6.8_

 

 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a)

 

Buyer shall provide, or cause its Subsidiaries to provide, the employees of
the Group Companies who are employed by the Group Companies as of the Closing
Date and who remain employed with Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the
Group Companies) thereafter (the " _Group Company Employees_ ") with (i) from
and after the Closing Date through (x) the first anniversary of the Closing
Date with respect to Group Company Employees based in the United States or
Canada (the "North American Group Company Employees") and (y) the second
anniversary of the Closing Date with respect to Group Company Employees other
than the North American Group Company Employees, the same base salaries and
annual bonus opportunities provided to such Group Company Employees as of the
date of this Agreement and (ii) from and after the Closing Date through (x)
December 31, 2010, with respect to North American Group Company Employees and
(y) December 31, 2011 with respect to Group Company Employees other than the
North American Group Company Employees, retirement and welfare benefits
(including through participation and coverage under Buyers and its
Subsidiaries (excluding, for these purposes, after the Closing Date, the
Group Companies) retirement and welfare benefit plans (the " _Buyer Benefit
Plans_ ")) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the retirement
and welfare benefits provided to Group Company Employees immediately prior to
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _that_ continued participation and
coverage following the Closing Date under the Company Benefit Plans as in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be deemed to satisfy the
obligations under clause (ii) of this sentence, it being understood that the
Group Company Employees may commence participating in the comparable Buyer
Benefit Plans on different dates following the Closing Date with respect to
different comparable Buyer Benefit Plans.

 

(b)

 

For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate
and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Group Company Employees after the
Closing Date (including the Company Benefits Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "),
each Group Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service
with the Group Companies and their predecessors before the Closing Date, to
the same extent as such Group Company Employee was entitled, before the
Closing Date, to credit for such service under any similar Group Company
employee benefit plan in which such Group Company Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing Date, _provided_
_that_ the foregoing shall not apply (i) with respect to benefit accrual under
any defined benefit pension plan, (ii) for purposes of any New Plan under
which similarly-situated employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries do not
receive credit for prior service, (iii) for purposes of any New Plan that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation or (iv) to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent
legally permissible, (i) each Group Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under
a Company Benefit Plan in which such Group Company Employee participated
immediately before the Closing Date (such plans, collectively, the " _Old
Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing

 


  

 

-56-

  medical, dental, pharmaceutical, life insurance and/or vision benefits to any
Group Company Employee, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under
the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such
employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date and Buyer shall,
or shall cause the Company to, cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket and
lifetime maximum limitations or requirements applicable to such employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c)

 

From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, honor all obligations under the Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Closing Date,
_provided_ _that_ nothing herein shall prohibit Buyer or the Company from
amending, suspending or terminating any particular Company Benefit Plan to the
extent permitted by its terms and applicable Law.

 

(d)

 

With respect to any Group Company Employees based outside of the United
States, Buyers obligations under this _Section 6.8_ shall be modified to the
extent necessary to comply with applicable Laws of the countries and political
subdivisions thereof in which such Group Company Employees are based.

 

(e)

 

Lux Seller shall, or shall cause the applicable Group Company to, take all
Facilitating Actions that are required to be taken after the date hereof,
whether by Law or otherwise, as soon as reasonably practicable following the
date hereof (and in any event prior to the Closing Date).

 

(f)

 

In order to facilitate satisfying the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code, the Company shall, on or prior to the Closing
Date, have submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company (or other
relevant entity) for their determination all payments or benefits for which
there is no contractual entitlement or with respect to which any contractual
entitlement has been waived that in the absence of such a vote could
reasonably be viewed as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder) made to any individuals that
are "disqualified individuals" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code
and the regulations thereunder; _provided_ , _that_ such stockholder vote
shall be structured in a manner intended to meet the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and shall be in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.

 

(g)

 

Without limiting the generality of _Section 10.7_ , the provisions of this
_Section 6.8_ are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no current or
former director, officer, employee or any other individual associated
therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of
this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall constitute or be

 


  

 

-57-

  deemed to be an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or any other
compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Group Companies
for any purpose.

 

 _Section 6.9_

 

 _Termination of Indebtedness; Financing; Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a)

 

Lux Seller shall deliver to Buyer at least three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date copies of deeds of release or other documentation (the " _Release
Documentation_ "), in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer (including, if
applicable, language providing authorization to Buyer, from and after the
Closing Date, to file all Uniform Commercial Code termination statements and
any release and similar documents, in each case, as are necessary to
effectuate, or reflect of public record, the release and discharge of any
guarantees and security interests, liens and other security evidenced by
financing statements or other filings, including if applicable all Uniform
Commercial Code statements) (subject to completion of local filings and
notifications to record any such releases), from the administrative agent or
other applicable persons under the Credit Facilities stating that such Credit
Facilities are or will be upon delivery of funds arranged by Buyer paid in
full, and Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to also have included in
any such Release Documentation, if applicable, a statement that all
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under such Credit Facility are
terminated, and all commitments in respect of each Credit Facility terminated
and shall deliver all instruments necessary or desirable for the satisfaction,
release and discharge of all security interests, mortgages, liens and other
security granted over the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties and
assets securing such obligations (subject to delivery of funds as arranged by
Buyer, if necessary and subject to completion of local filings and
notifications to record any such actions) immediately upon receipt on the
Closing Date by the administrative agents or other applicable persons of the
amounts specified in the Release Documentation. 

 

(b)

 

Sellers shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, deliver
all notices and take all other actions required by the terms of the Credit
Facilities or reasonably requested by Buyer in order to permit repayment on
the Closing Date of all outstanding Indebtedness under the Credit Facilities

together with available cash resources of Buyer, is at least equal to the
Sufficient Amount, (ii) on terms that are substantially consistent with or not
substantially less favorable to Buyer, in Buyers good faith commercial
judgment, than the terms set forth in the Buyer Financing Term Sheet (other
than proposed interest rates and other items included in Weighted Average Cost
of Debt Financing set forth therein) or on such other terms and conditions as
are acceptable to Buyer in its sole discretion (it being understood that any
provision in Financing that provides for less than $450 million of borrowing
availability under the revolving credit facility on the Closing Date and after
giving effect to the borrowings to fund the transactions hereunder shall be
deemed to be substantially less favorable to Buyer), and (iii) for which, as
of the Closing Date, the Weighted Average Cost of Debt Financing of such debt
financing is not in excess of the amount set forth on _Section 6.9(a)_ of the
Buyer Disclosure Schedules (the " _Acceptable Financing_ " and any of Buyers
financing for the transactions described in this Agreement, the " _Financing_
")); _provided_ _that_ (a) notwithstanding anything to the

 


  

 

-58-

  contrary contained herein, nothing in this Agreement shall require the Buyer
to arrange or obtain Financing that is not Acceptable Financing; and (b) in
the event that Buyer accepts Financing with cash proceeds equal to the
Sufficient Amount (less other available cash resources of Buyer) which does
not otherwise meet the terms of Acceptable Financing, such financing shall be
considered Acceptable Financing under this Agreement. 

 

(d)

 

In furtherance of the foregoing covenant, if Acceptable Financing is available
to Buyer, Buyer hereby agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to such Acceptable
Financing which are otherwise reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and (subject to
the provisions of clause (c)(ii) above) to offer customary fees, discounts and
other incentives to potential financing sources, (ii) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to such Acceptable Financing in such
definitive agreements, and (iii) if financing is available to Buyer that is
Acceptable Financing, Buyer will use reasonable best efforts to consummate the
Acceptable Financing at or prior to the Closing. Buyer shall keep the Company
and Lux Seller informed periodically and on request by Seller as to its
progress regarding obtaining the Acceptable Financing (including promptly
providing copies of any agreements entered into with respect to any Financing)
and shall consider in good faith any suggestions or recommendations the
Company or Lux Seller may have with respect to the Acceptable Financing,
including potential financing sources as well as the structure of the
Acceptable Financing.

 

(e)

 

Prior to the Closing, the Group Companies shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, use reasonable best efforts to, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective representatives to, at Buyers sole expense
for any and all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, provide to
Buyer such cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer to the extent necessary,
proper or advisable in connection with the Financing, including: (i)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows,
due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies; (ii) assisting with
the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering
documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Financing,
including execution and delivery of customary representation letters in

placement memoranda or prospectuses in relation to securities need not be
issued by any Group Company; (iii) furnishing Buyer and its financing sources
with the financial statements and other information regarding the Group
Companies set forth on _Schedule 6.9(e)_ (such information in this clause
(iii), the " _Required Information_ "); (iv) using reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with and assist Buyer in obtaining customary accountants comfort
letters including "negative assurance" comfort (provided that the relevant
financing institutions shall have provided customary representation or
engagement letters, as applicable to Sellers accountants) and consents of
accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the
Financing, legal opinions, appraisals, surveys, title insurance and other
customary documentation and items relating to Acceptable Financing as
reasonably requested by Buyer; (v) executing and delivering, as of the
Closing, any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing
documents, or other certificates or documents, as may be reasonably requested
by Buyer (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of any Group
Company with respect to solvency matters) and otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral (including cooperation in connection
with the pay-off of existing indebtedness and the release of related Liens in
accordance with their respective terms); (vii) taking commercially reasonable

 


  

 

-59-

  actions necessary to (A) permit the prospective lenders involved in the
Financing to evaluate the Companys current assets, cash management and
accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purposes
of establishing collateral arrangements as of the Closing and (B) establish,
effective as of the Closing, bank and other accounts and blocked account
agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the Financing; (viii)
taking all corporate actions, subject to the Closing, reasonably requested by
Buyer that are necessary or customary to permit the consummation of the
Acceptable Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof, to be made available
to the Company and Seller on the Closing Date to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; it being understood that the Company shall
have satisfied its obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9(e)_ if the
Company shall have used its reasonable best efforts to comply with such
obligations whether or not any applicable deliverables are actually obtained
or provided or any applicable actions are consummated. The Company will
notify Buyer of any material error, mistake or omission in the Required
Information or the other information provided pursuant to this _Section
6.9(e)_ that it becomes aware of and if requested by Buyer will use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly correct such error, mistake or omission.
The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in
connection with the Financing; _provided_ _that_ such logos are used solely in
a manner that is not intended to nor is reasonably likely to harm or disparage
any Group Company, the reputation or goodwill of any Group Company or any of
the Group Companies assets, including their logos and marks. No Group
Company shall be required, under the provisions of this _Section 6.9_ or
otherwise in connection with any Financing (x) to pay any commitment or other
similar fee prior to the Closing that is not advanced or substantially
simultaneously reimbursed by Buyer or (y) to incur any out-of-pocket expense
unless such expense is reimbursed by Buyer upon request or on the earlier of
the Closing or termination of this Agreement in accordance with _ARTICLE 8_.
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Group Companies from and
against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with (1)
any action taken by them at the request of Buyer pursuant to this _Section
6.9_ or in connection with the arrangement of the Financing or (2) any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided
by the Group Companies or any Seller). Nothing contained in this _Section
6.9_ or otherwise shall require the Company to be an issuer or other obligor
with respect to the Financing prior to the Closing.

(a)

 

The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, to take such

request, to be effective and completed on or immediately prior to the Closing
Date, _provided_ _that_ the Pre-Acquisition Reorganization Activity would not
be reasonably likely to impair or delay the consummation of the transactions
described herein, or be reasonably likely to result in any adverse financial,
tax or other consequence for Sellers or Buyer, respectively. No such Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization Activity shall, if taken as requested, be
considered to constitute a breach of the representations or warranties or
covenants hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, a " _Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization Activity_ " may include any internal reorganizations,
liquidations, contributions or consolidations of the Group Companies, or a
capitalization, transfer or cancellation of any intercompany debt requested to
be capitalized, transferred or cancelled by Buyer. Buyer shall be obligated
to pay all out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including any incremental Taxes)
of Sellers and Sellers Affiliates and shareholders in connection with any
Pre-Acquisition Reorganization Activity requested by Buyer. 

 


  

 

-60-

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any amounts for which
Buyer is obligated to pay pursuant to the previous sentence shall not be taken
into account in determining any purchase price adjustment pursuant to _Section
2.3_. Sellers shall be obligated to pay all out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including any incremental Taxes) of Buyer, Buyers Affiliates and the Group
Companies in connection with any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization Activity
requested by Sellers.

liabilities relating to the KL Business which are not otherwise transferred as

for Sellers or Sellers Affiliates and shareholders.

the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company to honor any indemnification
agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries with any of their respective
directors, officers and employees existing as of the date hereof, copies of
which have previously been provided to Buyer. For a period of six (6) years

arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing Date,
except that in no event shall Buyer be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more than 200% of the

-65-

  the failure of such representations and warranties (other than those set forth
in clause (a) of Section 5.10, which shall be true and correct in all
respects) to be so true and correct as of such dates would not have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect or be reasonably be expected to have, individually or

its obligations hereunder; _provided_ , _that_ for the purposes of the
foregoing clause, the qualifications as to "materiality," "material," "in all

 _Section 7.4_

condition set forth in this _ARTICLE 7_ to be satisfied if such failure was
caused by (a) such Partys failure to use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Closing to occur, as required by _Section 6.5_ or (b) any other material
breach of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 8 
 TERMINATION; AMENDMENT; WAIVER

 

Section 8.1

 

 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing.

 

(a)

 

by mutual written consent of Buyer and Lux Seller;

 

(b)

 

by Buyer, if the Company or Sellers breach or fail to perform any of their
respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement such that the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section 7.2(b)_ , _Section 7.2(c)_ or _Section 7.2(d)_ are incapable of being
satisfied prior to the Termination Date;

 

(c)

 

by Lux Seller, if Buyer breaches or fails to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement such that

 


  

 

-66-

  the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_
are incapable of being satisfied prior to the Termination Date;

 

(d)

 

by either Buyer or Lux Seller if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have been August 16, 2010 (the " _Termination Date_ "),
unless the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is the result of a material breach by Buyer (in the case of
termination by Buyer) or a material breach by Seller or the Company (in the
case of termination by Seller) of their respective obligations or covenants
under this Agreement, _provided_ , _that_ , in the event that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been consummated by the
Termination Date solely due to a Tolling Event, the Termination Date shall be
extended until the 15th Business Day following the resolution of such Tolling
Event; or

 

(e)

 

by either Buyer or by Seller, if any Governmental Entity with authority over
any jurisdiction in which the Company or Buyer have material operations shall
have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently
enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Closing and such order,
decree or ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;
_provided_ , _that_ the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(e)_ shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to
remove such order, decree, ruling, judgment or injunction.

 

 _Section 8.2_

 

 _Termination Fee_. Immediately after a termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1, Buyer and Sellers agree that Buyer and Sellers shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to immediately deliver to Lux Seller, on behalf of Sellers, the
Termination Fee from the Termination Fee Escrow Account unless either (i) this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_ and Buyer and Lux Seller
agree as part of such termination that the Termination Fee is not due to
Sellers, or (ii) the failure of the Closing to occur is primarily the result
of a willful and material breach by Sellers or the Company of this Agreement,
which breach would result in the failure of any condition set forth in
_Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ to be satisfied; whereupon the occurrence of
the events set forth under clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 8.2_ , Buyer
and Lux Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to Buyer the Termination Fee from the
Termination Fee Escrow Account. If the Termination Fee is paid or, following
Buyers instruction to the Escrow Agent to release the Termination Fee, due to
Lux Seller, on behalf of Sellers, Buyer shall have no further liability,
whether in law or equity, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby to Sellers or the Company or any Affiliate thereof, other
than payment of the Termination Fee, except in a circumstance in which the
failure of the Closing to occur is primarily the result of any willful and
material breach by Buyer or BV Buyer of this Agreement.

 

 _Section 8.3_

 

 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , this entire Agreement shall forthwith become void
(and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Buyer, Seller or
the Company or their respective officers, directors or equityholders) with the
exception of (a) the provisions of this _Section 8.1_ , the last sentence of
_Section 6.4_ , and _ARTICLE 10_ , and (b) any liability of any Party for any
willful and material breach of its obligations under this Agreement prior to
such termination. "Willful and material breach" shall mean a material breach
that is a consequence of an act undertaken by the

 


  

 

-67-

  breaching party with the knowledge (actual or constructive) that the taking of
such act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this
Agreement.

 

 _Section 8.4_

 

 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written
agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of Buyer,
Sellers, and the Company. This Agreement may not be modified or amended
except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and any amendment by
any Party or Parties effected in a manner which does not comply with this
_Section 8.1(h)_ shall be void.

 

 _Section 8.5_

 

 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Sellers may, on
behalf of Sellers and the Company, (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of Buyer contained herein, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of Buyer contained herein
or in any document, certificate or writing delivered by Buyer pursuant hereto
or (c) waive compliance by Buyer with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. At any time prior to the Closing, Buyer may (i) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the

representations and warranties of the Company and Seller contained herein or
in any document, certificate or writing delivered by the Company or Sellers

of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part
of any Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure or delay
on the part of any Party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

 

ARTICLE 9 
 NON-SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

 

 _Section 9.1_

 

 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in this Agreement

covenants and agreements contained herein and therein (including Section 6.12)

this _Article 9_ and _Article 10_.

 

 _Section 9.2_

from any damages, losses, liabilities, obligations, taxes, claims of any kind,
interest or expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses (each, a " _Loss_ ") suffered or paid, directly or
indirectly, (a) as a result of, in connection with or arising out of any
breach of any representation or warranty made by KL Company contained in
_Section 3.21_ or (b) relating to, in connection with or arising out of the
Disposed Business. In the event that Lux Seller or KL Company transfers a
majority of the assets of KL Company, Seller and KL Company shall cause the
purchaser or transferee of such assets to assume KL Companys obligations
related to the Disposed Business pursuant to this _ARTICLE 9_. The amount of
any and all Losses determined in connection with this Section 9.2 shall be

 


  

 

-68-

  determined net of (i) any amounts actually recovered by any Buyer Indemnitee
under insurance policies and (ii) any net tax benefits actually realized by
Buyer through a reduction in Taxes otherwise payable. The provisions of this
Section 9.2 shall be binding on any successor to or assign of KL Company.

 

 _Section 9.3_

the matters set forth on _Schedule 9.3_ , subject to the limitations,
procedures and terms set forth on such Schedule.

 _Section 10.12_

 

 _Jurisdiction and Venue_. 

 

(a)

proceeding, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware
in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to
assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation
or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto
or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or in the event (but only in
the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such
action or proceeding, in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware, or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in
or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims
with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, or in the event (but only in the event) that such
court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such

 


  

 

-72-

  action or proceeding, in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware. The parties hereby consent to and grant the Delaware Court of
Chancery, or in the event (but only in the event) that such court does not
have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware, jurisdiction over the
person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject
matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in
_Section 10.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof.

 

(b)

 

Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not (and it will not permit its
controlled Affiliates to) bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any source of
Financing in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the arrangement, underwriting or
provision thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, or if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof);
_provided_ , _that_ the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that any
agreement entered into after the date hereof between any party hereto (or its
affiliate) and any source of Financing provides otherwise (which further
agreement shall only bind the parties hereto with their consent).

 

 _Section 10.13_

 

 _Remedies; Limitation on Damages; Liabilities_.

 

(a)

 

Any Person having any rights under any provision of this Agreement shall be
entitled to enforce such rights specifically (without posting a bond or other
security). All such rights and remedies shall be cumulative and non-
exclusive, and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. The parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached.

 

(b)

 

Each Party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any
other Party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the
non-breaching Party shall be entitled to seek and obtain (i) a decree or order
of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation, and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach. In circumstances where Buyer or Sellers are obligated to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such
transactions have not been consummated (other than as a result of the other
partys refusal to close in violation of this Agreement) each of Buyer and
each Seller expressly acknowledges and agrees that the other party and its
shareholders shall have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will
be inadequate to compensate such other party and its shareholders, and that
such other party on behalf of itself and its shareholders shall be entitled to
enforce specifically Buyers or Sellers, as the case may be, obligation to
consummate such transactions.

 

(c)

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
acknowledge and agree that neither Sellers nor any Group Company shall be
entitled to enforce specifically the obligations of Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this

 


  

 

-73-

  Agreement unless all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section
7.2_ shall have been satisfied or waived, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, _Section 7.2(j)_. If (i) financing is available to Buyer that is
Acceptable Financing and (ii) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_
and _Section 7.2_ (other than _Section 7.2(j)_ ) shall have been satisfied or
waived, Sellers shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to cause Buyer to borrow the proceeds of the Acceptable
Financing.

 

(d)

 

Each party further agrees that no other party or any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section 10.13_ , and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument.

 

(e)

 

No Party shall be liable for any consequential, punitive or special damages
related to any breach of this Agreement or any claim for indemnification
hereunder.

 

(f)

 

The liabilities and obligations of each Seller hereunder shall be several and
not joint.
