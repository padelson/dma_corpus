Objection"). If the Earnout Representative does not deliver such an Earnout
Notice of Objection within such sixty (60) day period, the EBIT provided for
in the applicable Earnout Notice shall be final and binding upon the parties
and shall constitute, as applicable, the Final CY12 EBIT or the Final CY13
EBIT.

 

(iii) If the Earnout Representative shall have delivered an Earnout Notice of
Objection with respect to the Earnout Notice in a timely manner, the Earnout
Representative and Parent will attempt in good faith to resolve such objection
or dispute. If the Earnout Representative and Parent should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement will be prepared and signed by
both parties. In the event that the Earnout Representative and Parent cannot
come to such an agreement within thirty (30) days (or such longer period as
the Earnout Representative and Parent may mutually determine) after the date
on which the Earnout Representative delivered the applicable Earnout Notice
of Objection, such dispute shall be resolved in the manner set forth in
Section 9.7. If the Earnout Representative executes a memorandum with Parent
resolving an objection to an Earnout Notice pursuant hereto or a resolution
is made pursuant to Section 9.7, then such resolution shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon the parties to this Agreement, the Shareholders
and holders of Company Options and the EBIT provided for in such resolution
shall constitute, as applicable, the Final CY12 EBIT or the Final CY13 EBIT.

(iv) Except with the written consent of Parent, no Person may sell, exchange,
transfer or otherwise dispose of his, her or its right to receive any portion
of the Total

 



17  CY12 Earnout Consideration or the Total CY13 Earnout Consideration, other

Parent.

(v) Following the Closing, any and all decisions with respect to any aspect of
the operation of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries and including matters
directly or indirectly related to the amount of EBIT, shall be made by Parent
in its sole discretion without any express or implied obligation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing:

A. Parent shall not take any action not otherwise justified for good faith
business reasons which has the effect of reducing the earning or payment of
the Total CY12 Earnout Consideration or the Total CY13 Earnout Consideration;
and

 

B. The Earnout Representative and the most senior executive of Parents EA
Interactive division shall, during the period commencing with the Effective
Time and ending on December 28, 2013, meet at least once every 90 days to
discuss in good faith potential synergy opportunities with regard to the
business of PopCap Studio and the other business conducted by Parent. To
the extent that a material synergy opportunity is identified in such meetings
and the pursuit of such opportunity is commercially reasonable both to PopCap
Studio and to Parent, then Parent shall provide commercially reasonable
cooperation to seek to realize such synergy opportunities; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not be required to take any action pursuant to
this Section 1.6(e)(v)B to the extent that the Earnout Representative does not
agree in writing (which agreement may be by email to the most senior
executive of Parents EA Interactive division, but in any event must reference
intent to be binding under this Agreement) that the Costs thereof are Company
Costs, to the extent such Costs are subject to clause (iii) of the definition
of Company Costs.

(vi) The Shareholders and holders of Company Options, by adopting this
Agreement, irrevocably appoint the Earnout Representative as their agent and
attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of each of the Shareholders and holders of

the transactions contemplated hereby, which shall include the power and
authority for purposes of this Section 1.6(e):

18 E. to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Earnout Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

(vii) David Roberts shall be the initial Earnout Representative (the "Earnout
Representative"). If David Roberts ceases to be an employee of PopCap Studio,

be an employee of PopCap Studio, the employee of PopCap Studio ranked most
senior by Parent employment grade who has a right to receive a portion of the
Total CY12 Earnout Consideration and the Total CY13 Earnout Consideration
shall be the Earnout Representative, unless Brian Fiete, Jason Kapalka and
John Vechey object in writing within five (5) days following notice of the
appointment of the applicable Earnout Representative. If Brian Fiete, Jason
Kapalka and John Vechey object to such person, the Earnout Representative
shall be the employee of PopCap Studio ranked next most senior by Parent
employment grade who has a right to receive a portion of the Total CY12
Earnout Consideration and the Total CY13 Earnout Consideration who is not
objected to, in writing, by Brian Fiete, Jason Kapalka and John Vechey within
five (5) days following notice of the appointment of the applicable Earnout
Representative.

 

(viii) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Earnout Representative
with respect to the matters regarding the calculation and the determination
of the Final CY12 EBIT and Final CY13 EBIT contemplated by this Section
1.6(e), including an amendment, extension or waiver with respect to the
matters contemplated by this Section 1.6(e) pursuant to Section 8.3 and
Section 8.4 hereof, shall constitute a decision of all of the Shareholders and
holders of Company Options and shall be final, binding and conclusive, and
Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Earnout Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of
each Shareholder and holder of Company Options. Parent is hereby relieved from
any Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Earnout Representative. The
Earnout Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Earnout Representative while acting in good faith and without
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

(ix) The Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify the Earnout Representative and
hold the Earnout Representative harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on
the part of the Earnout Representative and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Earnout Representatives duties
hereunder, including any out-of-pocket costs and the reasonable fees and
expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Earnout Representative ("Earnout
Representative Expenses"). The Earnout Representative shall have the right to
recover Earnout Representative Expenses from the Representative Fund.
Following the termination of the Escrow Fund, the resolution of all Unresolved
Claims and the satisfaction of all claims made by Indemnified Parties for
Losses, the Earnout Representative shall have the right to recover Earnout
Representative Expenses from the Escrow Fund prior to any distribution to the
Indemnifying Parties, and prior to any such distribution, shall deliver to
the Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth the Earnout Representative
Expenses actually incurred, to the extent such Earnout Representative Expenses
exceed the amount of the Representative Fund and if such Earnout
Representative Expenses have not been paid directly to the

 



19  Earnout Representative by the Indemnifying Parties. After the release of the
Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Earnout
Representative may seek recovery of any unpaid Earnout Representative
Expenses from the Indemnifying Parties according to their respective Pro Rata
Portions.

(x) The Earnout Representative may engage attorneys, accountants, investment
bankers, advisors, consultants and clerical personnel and obtain such other
professional and expert assistance, and maintain such records, as the Earnout
Representative may deem necessary or desirable and incur other out-of-pocket
expenses related to performing its services hereunder, with the fees and
expenses of such engagements and assistance considered Earnout Representative
Expenses. The Earnout Representative may in good faith rely conclusively upon
information, reports, statements and opinions prepared or presented by such
professionals.

 

(xi) Parent acknowledges that if the Earnout Representative is at any relevant
time an employee of Parent or one of its Subsidiaries that the Earnout
Representative will be permitted to act, in the performance of his or her
duties as Earnout Representative, in a manner that is consistent with the
interests of the Effective Time Holders even if he or she is, accordingly,
adverse to Parent in the performance of such duties.

1.7 _Withholding of Taxes and Fees._ The Company, the Exchange Agent, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
and from any other payments otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
any provision of federal, local or foreign tax law or under any applicable
Legal Requirements or pursuant to other applicable judgments, decrees,
injunctions or orders (such amounts to be calculated prior to any deductions
for Banker Contingent Fees). In addition, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable to or on behalf of any Company Capital Stock and
Company Options such amounts (including the full principal amount and all
accrued, unpaid interest) as are owing at such time by such holder to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent. Before making any payment
of either Total CY12 Earnout Consideration or Total CY13 Earnout
Consideration to any Effective Time Holders or other persons entitled thereto,
the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable with respect to such Total CY12
Earnout Consideration or Total CY13 Earnout Consideration an amount equal to
two percent (2%) (calculated prior to any other deductions or withholdings
permitted by this Section 1.7) of the amounts thereof that would otherwise be
payable to each Effective Time Holder, and shall instead remit the amounts so
withheld to Qatalyst Partners LP as payment of the Banker Contingent Fees; if
Parent enters into any separate agreement for engagement of the Exchange
Agent (or any successor thereto), such agreement shall also set forth the
requirements of this sentence. To the extent any of the foregoing amounts are
so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Effective Time Holder to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid (and, for the sake of clarity, no
Effective Time Holder shall be entitled to claim full payment of the Per
Share CY12 Earnout Consideration, the Per Share CY13 Earnout Consideration,
the Preferred Per Share CY12 Earnout Consideration or the Preferred

 



20  Per Share CY13 Earnout Consideration without deduction therefrom of the two
percent (2%) amount for payment of the related Banker Contingent Fees).

perfecting such holders right to dissent from the Merger and obtain payment
of the fair value of the shares of Company Capital Stock he, she or it owns
and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such holders dissenters rights
under Washington Law (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive the applicable consideration
for Company Capital Stock set forth in Section 1.6 hereof, but the holder
thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are provided by Washington
Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.8(a) hereof, if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders dissenters rights under Washington Law,
then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event,
such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only
the right to receive the consideration for Company Capital Stock, as
applicable, set forth in Section 1.6 hereof, without interest thereon, and
subject to the provisions of Section 7.5 hereof, upon surrender of the
certificate representing such shares.

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for
dissenters or appraisal rights received by the Company pursuant to the
applicable provisions of Washington Law and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. After the Effective Time, Parent shall give the Shareholder
Representative the opportunity to participate in, but not control, all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Washington Law. Prior to the Effective Time, neither the Company nor Parent
shall, except with the prior written consent of the other party, make any
payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such
demands. Any communication to be made by the Company to any Shareholder with
respect to such demands shall be submitted to Parent in advance and shall not
be presented to any Shareholder prior to the Company receiving Parents
written consent. Parent, the Company and, after the Effective Time,
the Shareholder Representative, shall cooperate in good faith with any
proceeding with respect to any appraisal of Company Capital Stock and each
shall make available all information reasonably requested by the other party
for such purposes.

hereof), keep the initial

Article I an amount of cash equal to the portion of the Total CY12 Earnout

Exchange Agent shall mail a letter of transmittal to each Shareholder at the
address set forth opposite each such holders name on the Spreadsheet. After

22  immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding
Company Capital Stock that were converted into the right to receive
consideration pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for cash) and any other
documents that Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably require in order to
effect the exchange (the "Exchange Documents"), the Shareholders will
surrender the certificates representing their shares of Company Capital Stock
(the "Company Stock Certificates") to the Exchange Agent for cancellation
together with duly completed and validly executed Exchange Documents. Upon
surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, or such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together
with such Exchange Documents, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, subject to the terms of Section
1.9(d) hereof, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled

of Company Capital Stock (without interest) into which such shares of Company
Capital Stock shall have been so converted. No portion of the Total Closing
Consideration, the Total CY12 Earnout Consideration or the Total CY13 Earnout
Consideration will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock formerly
represented thereby until the holder of record of such Company Stock
Certificate surrenders such Company Stock Certificate and delivers validly
executed Exchange Documents pursuant hereto.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amounts are to be disbursed pursuant
to Section 1.6 hereof to a Person other than the Effective Time Holder whose
name is reflected on the Company Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor, it will be a condition of the issuance or delivery thereof that the
certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid
to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the payment of any portion of the Total Closing Consideration,
the Total CY12 Earnout Consideration or the Total CY13 Earnout Consideration
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(e) _Exchange Agent to Return Cash Consideration_. At any time following the
last day of the sixth month following any deposit of amounts with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.9(b) hereof, Parent shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent or its designated successor or
assign such cash amounts, and any and all interest thereon or other income or
proceeds thereof, not disbursed to the holders of Company Stock Certificates
pursuant to Section 1.9(c) hereof, and thereafter the holders of Company Stock
Certificates shall be entitled to look only to Parent only as general
creditors thereof with respect to such cash amounts to the extent payable to
such holders of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof upon
the due surrender of such Company Stock Certificates and duly executed
Exchange Documents in the manner set forth in Section 1.9(c) hereof. No
interest shall be payable for the cash amounts

 



23  delivered to Parent pursuant to the provisions of this Section 1.9(e) and
which are subsequently delivered to the holders of Company Stock Certificates.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund in a U.S. Bank Money Market Deposit Account, as fully
described on Exhibit D attached hereto; _provided_ that no such investment or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the Shareholders pursuant to
Section 1.6 hereof.

 

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.9, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, nor any party
hereto shall be liable to an Effective Time Holder for any amount paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

 

1.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. __ The cash
amounts paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of Company
Capital Stock and Company Vested Options in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Capital Stock and Company Vested Options, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company
Stock Certificates or Company Options are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this __Article I.

 

1.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company Stock
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent or
the Company shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate or agreement, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, such amount, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section
1.6 hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion or as
required by the Exchange Agent as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the holder who is the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate or agreement to deliver a bond in such amount as it
may reasonably direct.

1.12 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company, Parent, Sub, and the officers and
directors of the Company, Parent and Sub are fully authorized in the name of
their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such

Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise binding upon the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties or
assets, which has or may reasonably be expected to have the effect of
prohibiting or impairing (i) any business practice of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, (ii) any acquisition of property (tangible or intangible) by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) the conduct of business by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) otherwise limiting the freedom of

2.13 _Title to Properties; Absence of Liens and Encumbrances; Condition of
Equipment_.

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any real property,
nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ever owned any real property.

(b) Section 2.13(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all real
property currently leased, subleased or licensed by or from the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise used or occupied by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (the "Leased Real Property"). Section 2.13(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all leases, lease guaranties,
subleases, agreements for the leasing, use or occupancy of, or otherwise
granting a right in or relating to the Leased Real Property, including the
name of the lessor, licensor, sublessor, master lessor and/or lessee, the
date and term of the lease, license, sublease or other occupancy right and the

terms, and there is not, under any of such Lease Agreements, any existing
default or event of default (or event which with notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or, to the Knowledge of the 

 



38  Company, the other party thereto. The Closing will not result in a breach or
default under, or affect the enforceability against any Person of any such
Lease Agreement or the rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
the Surviving Corporation to the continued use and possession of the Leased
Real Property. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries currently occupies all
of the Leased Real Property for the operation of its business. There are no

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any agreement or
subject to any claim that may require the payment of any real

agreements for real property that are no longer in effect and has no
continuing liability with respect to such terminated agreements.

suitable for the conduct of the Companys business. Neither the operation of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the Leased Real Property nor, to the
Companys Knowledge, such Leased Real Property, including the improvements
thereon, violate in any material respect any applicable building code, zoning
requirement or statute relating to such property or operations thereon.

more than $10,000 in causing any Leased Real Property to comply with the
surrender conditions set forth in the applicable Lease Agreement.

in the case of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all
of its tangible properties and assets, real, personal and mixed, used or held
for use in its business, free and clear of any Liens, except (i) as
reflected in the Current Balance Sheet, (ii) Liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable, and (iii) such imperfections of title and encumbrances, if any, which
do not detract from the value or interfere with the present use of the
property subject thereto or affected thereby.

(e) The material items of equipment owned or leased by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (i) are adequate for the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, and (ii) are in good
operating condition, regularly and properly maintained, subject to normal wear
and tear.

(h) _Standard Form Agreements_. Copies of the Companys current standard
form(s) of non-disclosure agreement and the Companys current standard

Subsidiaries), including any such Contracts containing covenants not to sue or
non-assertion provisions that are binding as to the Company Intellectual
Property ("Outbound Licenses").

Company and its Subsidiaries as it is currently conducted by the Company,

promotion, marketing, manufacture, delivery, sale and licensing out of any
Company Product, does not infringe or misappropriate, any
Intellectual Property Rights of any Person, violate any right of any Person
(including any right to privacy or publicity), or constitute unfair
competition or trade practices under the Laws of any jurisdiction, and will
not infringe or misappropriate when conducted in substantially the same
manner by Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation following the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing representation regarding following
the Closing does not apply to infringement or misappropriation caused by
changes made by Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation to the operation of
the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries or the Company Products when
there would have been no infringement or misappropriation but for such
changes. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice from any Person claiming that such operation or any Company Product, or
any Technology used by the Company, infringes or misappropriates any
Intellectual Property Rights of any Person or constitutes unfair competition
or trade practices under the Laws of any jurisdiction (nor does the Company
have Knowledge of any basis therefor). No Company Product or Company
Intellectual Property is subject to any proceeding or outstanding Order or
settlement agreement or stipulation that restricts in any manner the use,
provision, transfer, assignment or licensing thereof by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or may affect the validity, use or enforceability of such
Company Product or Company Intellectual Property. For the purposes of this
Section 2.14(j), "Company Product" shall be as defined above but without
regard to the three-year limitation in the definition. 

(k) _No Conflict_. All Inbound Licenses and Outbound Licenses (the "IP
Contracts") are in full force and effect, except to the extent they have
previously expired in accordance with their terms and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, all other parties to IP Contracts consider such IP contracts to be in
full force and effect. The consummation of the Transactions will not in any
material respect automatically (with or without the giving of notice or lapse
of time or both) violate or result in the breach, modification, cancellation,
termination, suspension of, or right to modify, cancel, terminate or suspend,
or acceleration of any payments with respect to, such IP Contracts. Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in all material respects is in compliance
with, and has not breached any term of any IP Contracts and, to the Knowledge
of the Company, all other parties to IP Contracts in all material respects are
in compliance with, and have not breached any material term thereof. Following
the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be 

 



43  permitted to exercise all of their respective rights under the IP Contracts
to the same extent the Company and its Subsidiaries would have been able to
had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred and without
the payment of any additional amounts or consideration other than ongoing
fees, royalties or payments that the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
Parent would otherwise be required to pay had the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement not occurred.

all Legal Requirements and Orders, including ERISA or the Code. Any Company
Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has
obtained a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter, if applicable)
as to its qualified status under the Code, and incorporates or has been
amended to incorporate all provisions required to comply with all currently
applicable legislation, and there has been no event, condition or circumstance

There are no actions, suits or claims pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated (other than routine claims for

Company Employee Plan. Each Company Employee Plan can be amended, terminated
or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its
terms, without liability to Parent, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any ERISA Affiliate (other than ordinary administration expenses or with
respect to benefits that were previously earned, vested or accrued in the
ordinary course under Company Employee Plans prior to such amendment,
termination or discontinuation). There are no audits, inquiries or proceedings
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by the IRS, DOL, or

Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate is
subject to any penalty or Tax with respect to any Company Employee Plan
under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects timely made
all contributions and other payments required by and due under the terms of
each Company Employee Plan.

(e) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all of its
bonus, commission and other compensation plans and has paid any and all

taxes or penalties for failure to comply with any of the terms or conditions
of such plans or the laws governing such plans.

(f) _No Pension Plan_. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever

(h) _Multiemployer and Multiple-Employer Plan, Funded Welfare Plans and
MEWAs_. At no time has the Company or any ERISA Affiliate contributed to or

any multiple employer plan or to any plan described in Section 413 of the
Code, a "funded welfare plan" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code,
or a Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangement, as defined under Section 3(40)(A)
of ERISA (without regard to Section 514(b)(6)(B) of ERISA).

(i) _No Post-Employment Obligations_. No Company Employee Plan or Employee
Agreement provides, or reflects or represents any liability to provide, post-
termination or retiree or post-employment life insurance, health or other
employee welfare benefits to any person for any reason, except as may be
required by COBRA or other applicable statute, and the Company has not ever
represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any
Employee (either individually or to Employees as a group) or any other person
that such Employee(s) or other person would be provided with life insurance,
health or other employee welfare benefits post-termination, except to the
extent required by statute. Section 2.22(i)(1) of the Disclosure Schedule

or otherwise) relating to such former Employees service with the Company,
other than Employee-paid COBRA benefits; and (ii) briefly describes such
benefits. Except as disclosed under Section 2.22(i)(2) of the Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have any legally binding
obligations to provide severance to any Employees.

(j)  _Effect of Transaction_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (alone
or in connection with additional or subsequent events) or any termination of
employment or service in connection therewith will (i) result in any payment

any Employee, (ii) result in any forgiveness of indebtedness, (iii) materially
increase any benefits otherwise payable by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or

federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations respecting employment,
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, worker

governed by or maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Entity, with
respect to unemployment compensation benefits, social security or other
benefits or obligations for Employees (other than routine payments to be made
and benefits payable in the normal course of business and consistent with
past practice). There are no material actions, suits, claims or
administrative matters pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
or reasonably anticipated against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
ERISA Affiliate or to the Knowledge of the Company any of their respective
Employees relating to any Employee Agreement or Company Employee Plan. There
are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably
anticipated claims or actions against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any Company trustee under any workers compensation policy or long-term
disability policy. The Company is not party to a conciliation agreement,
consent decree or other agreement or Order with any federal, state, or local
agency or Governmental Entity with respect to employment practices. The
services provided by the Companys, each of its Subsidiaries and their ERISA
Affiliates Employees are terminable at the will of the Company,
the Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates and any such termination would
result in no Liability to the Company, the Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate
(other than (x) ordinary administration expenses, (y) with respect to benefits
that were previously earned, vested or accrued under Company Employee Plans
prior to such termination, or (z) as disclosed in Section 2.22(j) of the
Disclosure Schedule). Section 2.22(k) of the Disclosure Schedule lists
all liabilities of the Company to any Employee that would result from the
termination by the Company or Parent of such Employees employment or
provision of services, other than those disclosed in Section 2.22(j) of the
Disclosure Schedule. Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any
ERISA Affiliate has direct or indirect material Liability with respect to any
misclassification of any person as an independent contractor rather than as an
employee, with respect to any employee leased from another employer or with
respect to any employee currently or formerly classified as exempt from
overtime wages.

(l) _Labor_. No strike, labor dispute, slowdown, concerted refusal to work
overtime, or work stoppage or labor strike against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or
reasonably anticipated. The Company has no Knowledge of any activities or
proceedings of any labor union, works council or other workers representative
group to organize any Employees. There are no actions, suits, claims, labor
disputes or grievances pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
or reasonably anticipated relating to any labor matters involving any
Employee, including charges of unfair labor practices. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair labor practices within
the

 



58  meaning of the National Labor Relations Act or similar law. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is presently, nor has been in the past, a
party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, union contract,
works council agreement or similar agreement with respect to Employees and no
such agreements are being negotiated by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

(m) _WARN_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action which would constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" within the
meaning of WARN or similar state or local law, issued any notification of a
plant closing or mass layoff required by WARN or similar state or local law,
or incurred any liability or obligation under WARN or any similar state or
local law that remains unsatisfied. No terminations prior to the Closing would
trigger any notice or other obligations under WARN or similar state or local
law.

 

(n) _No Interference or Conflict_. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
director, officer or Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
obligated under any Contract or subject to any Order of any Governmental
Entity that would interfere with such persons efforts to promote the
interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or that would interfere
with the Companys business. Neither the execution nor delivery of this
Agreement, nor the carrying on of the Companys business nor any activity of
such officers, directors or Employees in connection with the carrying on of
the Companys business will, to the Knowledge of the Company, conflict with
or result in a breach of the terms, conditions, or provisions of, or
constitute a default under, any Contract under which any of such officers,
directors or Employees is now bound. 

(o) _International Employee Plan_. Each International Employee Plan has been
established, maintained and administered in all material respects in
compliance with its terms and conditions and with the requirements prescribed
by any and all statutory or regulatory laws that are applicable to such
International Employee Plan. Furthermore, no International Employee Plan has
unfunded liabilities, that as of the Effective Time, will not be offset by
insurance or fully accrued. Except as required by law, no condition exists
that would prevent the Company or Parent from terminating or amending
any International Employee Plan at any time for any reason without liability
to the Company or its ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration
expenses or routine claims for benefits). To the extent applicable, each
International Employee Plan has been approved by the relevant taxation and
other Governmental Entities so as to enable: (i) the Company and the
participants and beneficiaries under the relevant International Employee Plan
and (ii) in the case of any International Employee Plan under which resources
are set aside in advance of the benefits being paid (a "Funded International
Employee Plan"), the assets held for the purposes of the Funded International
Employee Plans, to enjoy the most favorable taxation status possible and the
Company is not aware of any ground on which such approval may cease to apply.
Except as required by applicable Legal Requirements, no condition or term
under any relevant Company Employee Plan exists which would prevent the
Surviving Corporation or Parent from terminating or amending any International
Employee Plan at any time for any reason without material liability to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent (other than
ordinary administration expenses or routine claims for benefits).

 



59 (p) _Foreign Employees_. Each Employee resident in the Peoples Republic
of China ("PRC") has executed an employment contract with the Subsidiary of
the Company located in the PRC. Except as would not individually or in the
aggregate result in material liability to the Company, Surviving Corporation
or Parent:

(i) all Contracts of employment or for services with any employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who provide services outside the United
States ("Foreign Employees"), or with any director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries can be terminated by three (3) months notice or less given
at any time without giving rise to any claim for damages, severance pay, or
compensation (other than a statutory redundancy payment applicable by virtue
of Legal Requirement or compensation for unfair dismissal applicable by virtue
of law or any equivalent remedy under applicable local law); and

(ii) no promise has been made to any Foreign Employee that his defined
contribution benefits under any Funded International Employee Plan will at
any point in the future equate to or not be less than any particular amount.

2.23  _Insurance_. Section 2.23 of the Disclosure Schedule lists all
insurance policies and fidelity bonds covering the assets, business,
equipment, properties, operations, employees, officers and directors of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate, including the type
of coverage, the carrier, the amount of coverage, the term and the annual
premiums of such policies. There is no material claim by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate pending under any of such policies or
bonds as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed or that the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has a reason to
believe will be denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies or
bonds. In addition, there is no pending claim of which its total value
(inclusive, in the case of a defense within limits policy, of defense
expenses) would reasonably be expected to exceed the policy limits. With the
exception of Workers Compensation insurance where a premium audit may occur,
all premiums due and payable under all such policies and bonds have been paid,
(or if installment payments are due, will be paid if incurred prior to the
Closing Date) and the Company, its Subsidiaries and its ERISA Affiliates are
otherwise in material compliance with the terms of such policies and bonds (or
other policies and bonds providing substantially similar insurance coverage).
Such policies and bonds (or other policies and bonds providing substantially
similar coverage) have been in effect since the dates set forth on Section
2.23 of the Disclosure Schedule with respect to each applicable policy and
bond and remain in full force and effect. The Company does not have any
Knowledge or reasonable belief of threatened termination of, or premium
increase with respect to, any of such policies. Neither the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries nor any affiliate of either has ever maintained,
established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any self-insurance
plan.

2.24 _Compliance with Laws_. Except as is not material in any case or in the
aggregate, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has complied with and has
not violated any Legal Requirement. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice of suspected, potential or
actual violation with respect to any Legal Requirement during the past five
(5) years.

and accurate export control classifications applicable to the Companys
products, services, software and technologies.

Subsidiaries (including any of their respective officers, directors, agents,
distributors, employees or other Person associated with or acting on their
behalf) has, directly or indirectly, taken any action which would cause it to
be in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or
any rules or regulations thereunder or any similar anti-corruption or anti-
bribery Legal Requirements applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or to the Knowledge of the Company in any jurisdictions other

"Confidential Disclosure Agreement"), between the Company and Parent. The
Confidential Disclosure Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms, but shall terminate at the Effective Time. In this
regard, the Company acknowledges that the Parent Common Stock is publicly
traded and that any information obtained during the course of its due

matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including,

without the consent of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) subject to

contemplated hereby than is so contractually required to be disclosed and
shall, in any event, not be inconsistent with any public statements made by
Parent regarding the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby) and (b) the foregoing restrictions in this Section 5.3
shall not prevent any Person from complying with Legal Requirements compelling
any such statement or communication (which statements or communications will

disclosed).

 

5.4 _Reasonable Efforts; Regulatory Filings_.

to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using all reasonable efforts to accomplish the following:
(i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions
precedent set forth in Article VI hereof to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining
of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders
and authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations, declarations, submissions and filings

 



69  (including registrations, declarations, filings and submissions of responses
to Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as
may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or
proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iv) the defending of any
suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (v) the execution or delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection
with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of
Directors shall, if any takeover statute or similar Legal Requirement is or
becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Legal Requirement on
the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) _Regulatory Filings_. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall coordinate
and cooperate with one another and shall each use commercially reasonable
efforts to comply with, and shall each refrain from taking any action that

make all filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, application or submission of other documents required by any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation: (i) Notification and
Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ and responses to any requests for
additional information from the FTC and the DOJ as required by the HSR Act,
(ii) filings under any other comparable pre-merger notification forms
reasonably determined by Parent and the Company to be required by the merger
notification or control laws of any applicable jurisdiction, as agreed by the
parties hereto, and (iii) any filings required under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any applicable state or securities or "blue sky" laws and the
securities laws of any foreign country, or any other Legal Requirement
relating to the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company will cause all
documents that it is responsible for filing with any Governmental Entity
under this Section 5.4(b) to comply in all material respects with all
applicable Legal Requirements.

(c) _Exchange of Information_. Parent, Sub and the Company each shall promptly
supply the other with any information that may be required in order to
effectuate any filings or application pursuant to Section 5.4(b) hereof.
Except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, and subject to the
Confidential Disclosure Agreement, each of the Company, Sub and Parent shall
consult with the other prior to taking a position with respect to any such
filing, shall permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and to the
extent practicable, participate in and consider in good faith the views of the
other in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, filings,
submissions, memoranda, briefs, white papers, arguments, opinions and
proposals before making or submitting any of the foregoing to any Governmental
Entity by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with
any investigations or proceedings in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including under any antitrust or fair trade
Legal Requirement), coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging such
information and 

 



70  promptly provide the other and/or its counsel with copies of all filings,
presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made by
such party with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, _provided_ that with respect to any such
filing, presentation or submission, each of Parent, Sub and the Company need
not supply the other (or its counsel) with copies (or in the case of oral
presentations, a summary) to the extent that any law, treaty, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to such party requires such
party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such
properties or information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as may be
agreed in connection with any joint defense agreement executed between counsel
for Parent and counsel for the Company, Parent, Sub and the Company will not
be required to share with each other any documents covered by Item 4(c) of
filings prepared in connection with the HSR Act.

(d)  _Notification_. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company will notify the
other promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any officials of any
Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto
and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for

or the Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of such
occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity
such amendment or supplement.

(e) _Meetings with Governmental Entities_. To the extent permitted by the
relevant Governmental Entity, each of Parent, Sub, and the Company shall give
one another advance notice of all communications to and meetings with a
Governmental Entity, if any, relating to antitrust or competition matters
concerning the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby, and shall
permit one another, or one anothers representatives, to attend and
participate in all such meetings and communications.

 

(f) _Limitation on Divestiture_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require
Parent or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree to any Action of
Divestiture. The Company shall not take or agree to take any Action of
Divestiture without the prior written consent of Parent. For purposes of this
agreement, an "Action of Divestiture" shall mean (x) any license, sale or
other disposition or holding separate (through establishment of a trust or
otherwise) of any shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or
properties of Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (y) the imposition of any limitation on the ability of Parent,
its subsidiaries or affiliates or the Company or its Subsidiaries to conduct
their respective businesses or own any capital stock or assets or to acquire,
hold or exercise full rights of ownership of their respective businesses and,
in the case of Parent, the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or
(z) the imposition of any impediment on Parent, its subsidiaries or
affiliates or the Company or its Subsidiaries under any Legal Requirement,
Order or other legal restraint governing competition, monopolies or
restrictive trade practices. In addition, nothing herein shall require Parent
to litigate with any Governmental Entity.

 



71 5.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the other parties if any of the following occurs
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time: (a) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which could reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty of
the Company contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate such that
the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a)(i) or Section 6.3(a)(i) hereof, as
the case may be, would not be satisfied, and (b) any failure of such party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder such that the condition set forth
in Section 6.2(a)(ii) or Section 6.3(a)(ii) hereof, as the case may be, would
not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall not (x) limit or otherwise affect any
remedies available to any party or (y) constitute an acknowledgment or
admission of a breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by the Company pursuant
to this Section 5.5, however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the
Disclosure Schedule or prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of
warranty or breach of covenant.

5.6  _Additional Documents and Further Assurances_. Each party hereto, at the
request of another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other
instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary
or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 __5.7 _Shareholder Approval._

(a) Prior to or contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the
Company has solicited and obtained or shall solicit and obtain the written
consent of the Shareholders in the form of the Shareholder Written Consent,
which consent shall, as provided by Washington Law and the Charter Documents,
constitute the irrevocable approval of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the
Requisite Shareholder Consent, which shall also include and constitute the
irrevocable approval by the Shareholders of: (i) the escrow and
indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Parties set forth in Article
VII hereof and the deposit of cash equal to the Escrow Amount into the Escrow
Fund, (ii) the appointment of David Roberts as the Earnout Representative and
(iii) the appointment of David Roberts as the Shareholder Representative. The
Company shall deliver to Parent a copy of the written shareholder consents
obtained pursuant to the Requisite Shareholder Consent.

(b) To the extent required by Washington Law, the Company shall promptly
prepare and cause to be delivered to any Shareholder who has not approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby a notice of the approval of
the Merger and adoption of this Agreement by written consent of the
Shareholders pursuant to the applicable provisions of Washington Law, which
notice shall constitute the notice to the Shareholders required by Legal
Requirement that dissenters and/or appraisal rights may be available to the
Shareholders in accordance with Washington Law.

(c) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to submit for
approval by such number of Shareholders as is required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code any payments and/or benefits that Parent and the
Company mutually determine may, but for 

 



72  such approval, constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), so as to
render the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder inapplicable to any and all payments,
acceleration of vesting and/or other benefits that might otherwise result,
separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any amount and/or the
provision of any benefit that would not be deductible by reasons of Section
280G of the Code, with such shareholder vote to be obtained in a manner which
satisfies all applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code
and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "280G Approval").

(d) The Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent, prior to the shareholder
vote seeking the 280G Approval, a Parachute Payment Waiver, in substantially
the form attached hereto as Exhibit E ("Parachute Payment Waiver"), from each
Person who the Company reasonably believes is, with respect to the Company
and/or any ERISA Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), and who
might otherwise have, receive or have the right or entitlement to receive a
parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code, pursuant to which each such
Person shall agree, unless the 280G Approval has been obtained in a manner
which satisfies all applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, to waive any and all right or
entitlement to the payments, acceleration of vesting and/or other benefits
referred to in Section 5.7(c) hereof to the extent the value thereof exceeds
2.99 times such Persons base amount determined in accordance with Section
280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and each such
Parachute Payment Waiver shall remain in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall give the
Shareholders sufficient notice prior to the Closing such that no Shareholder
will be able to exercise appraisal or similar rights with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, if such
Shareholder has not perfected such rights prior to Closing, pursuant to the
applicable provisions of Washington Law. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that Shareholders holding no more than five
percent (5%) of any series or class of Company Capital Stock continue to have
a right to exercise appraisal, dissenters or similar rights under applicable
law with respect to their Company Capital Stock by virtue of the Merger.

 

(f) Any materials to be submitted to the Shareholders in connection with the
solicitation of their approval of the Merger and this Agreement, and if
required pursuant to Section 5.7(c) hereof, any materials submitted to the
Shareholders in connection with obtaining the 280G Approval (the "Soliciting
Materials"), shall be subject to the reasonable review and approval by Parent
(such approval or refusal thereof not to be unreasonably delayed by Parent).
The Company will promptly advise Parent in writing if at any time prior to the
Closing the Company shall obtain knowledge of any facts that might make it
necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the Soliciting Materials in
order to make statements contained or incorporated by reference therein not
misleading or to comply with applicable law.

 



73 (g)(i) The Companys Board of Directors has unanimously recommended that
the Companys shareholders vote in favor of the approval of the Merger, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the Shareholder
Written Consent; (ii) any Soliciting Materials shall include a statement to
the effect that the Companys Board of Directors has unanimously recommended
that the Companys shareholders vote in favor of the approval of the Merger,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the
Shareholder Written Consent; and (iii) neither the Companys Board of
Directors nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend or modify,
or propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent, its unanimous adoption of this Agreement and approval of
the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby nor the unanimous
recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors that the Company
Shareholders vote in favor of the approval of the Merger, this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.8 _Notice to Holders of Company Options_. At least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver notice to the holders of
Company Options, which such notice shall be in compliance with the terms of
such Company Options, that the Company Options will be treated as set forth
in Section 1.6(c)(i) hereof and the Company shall have taken all actions
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by Section 1.6(c) hereof as
required pursuant to Section 1.6(c)(ii) hereof. Any materials to be submitted
to the holders of Company Options in connection with the notice required under
this Section 5.8 shall be subject to the reasonable review and approval by
Parent.

 

5.9 _Termination of Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all action necessary to terminate the Plan, such termination to be effective
at or before the Effective Time.

5.10 _Termination of 401(k) Plan_. Effective as of no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the Company and any ERISA
Affiliate shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a "401(k) Plan") (unless
Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) Plans shall not
be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, the
Company shall provide Parent, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, with evidence that each 401(k) Plan has been terminated
(effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date)
pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, or such
ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. The Company
also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating each 401(k)
Plan as Parent may reasonably require.

5.11 _Consents_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of any parties to any
Contract as are required thereunder in connection with the Merger or for any
such Contracts to remain in full force and effect. Such consents,
modifications, waivers and approvals shall be in a form acceptable to Parent.
In the event the Merger does not close for any reason, Parent shall not have
any liability to the Company, the Shareholders or any other Person for any
costs, claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the Company seeking to
obtain such consents, modifications, waivers and approvals.

 



74 __5.12 _New Employment Arrangements._

 

(a) _Continuing Employment_. The employment of Continuing Employees shall be
on such terms and conditions as are substantially commensurate, in the
aggregate, with similarly-situated new hired employees of Parent who join
Parent through an acquisition transaction that contain earn-out provisions,
with such terms and conditions to be implemented in accordance with Parents
practices and when operationally practicable. To the extent permitted by
Parents employee benefits plans, for purposes of employee benefits for
Continuing Employees, Parent shall cause (i) its medical, dental, vision,
and 401(k) employee benefit plans to recognize service with the Company prior
to the Effective Time for purposes of determining eligibility and vesting (but
not for benefit accruals and not for vesting of equity-based awards), and (ii)
its vacation program (but not its sabbatical program) to recognize service
with the Company prior to the Effective Time only for purposes of determining
accrual levels for service following the Effective Time, in each case except
where doing so would cause a duplication of benefits. To the extent permitted
by Parents employee benefits plans, Parent shall (x) cause any and all pre-
existing condition (or actively at work or similar) limitations under any
group health and welfare plans to be waived with respect to such Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents subject to Legal Requirements and (y)
provide Continuing Employees with credit for any deductibles made during the
plan year in which the Closing Date occurs for the purposes of satisfying any
applicable deductible requirements under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement provided for the benefit of the Continuing Employees in which they
are eligible to participate on and after the Closing Date. 

(b) _Parent Restricted Stock Units and Parent Options_.

 

(i) _Allocation of Parent Equity_. Parent shall reserve a pool of up to
2,222,222 shares of Parent Common Stock (the reserved pool, the "Parent
Equity Pool") for grants to be allocated to Continuing Employees in the form
of Parent restricted stock units ("Parent Restricted Stock Units") and/or
stock options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock ("Parent Options")
pursuant to this Section 5.12(b). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will
allocate Parent Restricted Stock Units from the Parent Equity Pool. Each such
allocation by Parent shall reduce the Parent Equity Pool on a one-for-one
basis for each share covered by the allocated award of Parent Restricted Stock
Units. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent also may allocate Parent Options
from the Parent Equity Pool to Continuing Employees in the PRC. Each such
allocation by Parent shall reduce the Parent Equity Pool by one (1) share for
each three (3) shares covered by the allocated Parent Option. The amount
remaining in the Parent Equity Pool immediately prior to the Effective Time
after allocations by Parent of Parent Restricted Stock Units and any Parent
Options prior to the Effective Time shall constitute the "Remaining Pool." The
Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the "Company CEO") will recommend
allocations from the Remaining Pool for Continuing Employees, which may be in
the form of Parent Restricted Stock Units and/or Parent Options pursuant to
this Section 5.12(b). Each such allocation of Parent Restricted Stock Units
shall reduce the Remaining Pool on a one-for-one basis for each share covered
by each award of Parent Restricted Stock Units allocated by the Company CEO
and each such allocation of Parent Options shall reduce the Remaining Pool by
one (1) share for each three (3) shares covered by the Parent Options
allocated by the Company CEO. Allocations from the Remaining Pool shall be
made after

 



75  the Effective Time but on or before the one (1)-year anniversary of the
Closing Date. The Company CEO need not recommend that Parent allocate the full
Remaining Pool. All awards of Parent Restricted Stock Units and Parent
Options are subject to the approval of Parents Executive Compensation and
Leadership Committee or its authorized delegate(s). The number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Parent Restricted Stock
Units and Parent Options and available under the Parent Equity Pool and
remaining in the Remaining Pool pursuant to this Section 5.12(b) shall be
adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or similar
transactions with respect to Parent Common Stock to the extent provided under,
and consistent with, the terms of Parents equity compensation plan under
which such awards were or are to be granted.

 

(ii) _Parent Restricted Stock Units Allocated Prior to the Effective Time_.
Other than as provided in individual offer letters from Parent to any
Continuing Employee, each allocation, prior to the Effective Time, of Parent
Restricted Stock Units to a Continuing Employee shall be granted to such
Continuing Employee in four (4) separate grants of Parent Restricted Stock
Units ( _provided_ he or she remains an employee of Parent or a subsidiary of
Parent continuously through each grants effective date), covering the
aggregate number of Parent Restricted Stock Units allocated to
such individual on the allocation date, as follows: (A) 25% of the total
number of Parent Restricted Stock Units to be granted to the Continuing
Employee shall be granted at such time as shall reasonably be determined by
Parent, but generally within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date (such
grant date, the "Initial Grant Date"), and (B) 25% of the total number of
Parent Restricted Stock Units to be granted to the Continuing Employee shall
be granted on each of the first (1st), second (2nd) and third (3rd)
anniversaries of the Initial Grant Date. Each such award of Parent Restricted
Stock Units shall be scheduled to vest in full on the one (1)-year anniversary
of the effective date of that particular grant (subject to pro-rated
acceleration in connection with death and disability consistent with
Parents standard practice in similar circumstances), contingent upon the
recipients continued active employment with Parent (or a subsidiary of
Parent) from the grant date through the applicable vesting date.

 

(iii) _Parent Restricted Stock Units Allocated from the Remaining Pool_. Each
allocation of Parent Restricted Stock Units from the Remaining Pool to a
Continuing Employee shall be made as one (1) award covering the aggregate
number of Parent Restricted Stock Units allocated to such individual, shall be
granted generally in the month of November or May as soon as administratively
practicable following the date the allocation is made (provided such
Continuing Employee remains an employee of Parent or a subsidiary of Parent
continuously through the grants effective date), and shall be scheduled to
vest as to twenty-five percent (25%) of the award on each annual anniversary
of the date of grant (subject to pro-rated acceleration in connection with
death and disability consistent with Parents standard practice in similar
circumstances), contingent upon the recipients continued active employment
with Parent (or a subsidiary of Parent) from the grant date through the
applicable vesting date

(iv) _Options_. Parent Options may be granted only to Continuing Employees
located in the PRC. Parent Options may be allocated by Parent prior to the
Effective Time, or may be recommended by the Company CEO for allocation from
the Remaining Pool after the Effective Time but on or before the one (1)-year
anniversary of the Closing. Any Parent Options

 



76  allocated by Parent prior to the Effective Time shall be granted to the
applicable Continuing Employee no later than sixty (60) days following the
Closing Date ( _provided_ he or she remains an employee of Parent or a
subsidiary of Parent continuously through each grants effective date). Parent
Options recommended for allocation by the Company CEO from the Remaining Pool
and approved Parents Executive Compensation and Leadership Committee or its
authorized delegate(s) shall be granted at such time as shall reasonably be
determined by Parent, but generally in the month of November or May first
following the allocation. Each Parent Option shall be scheduled to vest as to
24% of the total shares subject to such Parent Option on the first calendar
day of the month that is twelve (12) months from the date of the options date
of grant, and as to an additional 2% of the total shares subject to
such Parent Option on the first calendar day of each month thereafter for 38
months, contingent upon the recipients continued active employment with
Parent (or a subsidiary of Parent) from the grant date through the applicable
vesting date. 

(c) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Section 5.12 is intended to be for
the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
Section 5.12 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to confer upon any
other Person any rights or remedies hereunder or make any employee or other
service provider of the parties a third party beneficiary of this Section
5.12.

5.13 _Closing Date Cash and Debt Statement_. The Company shall prepare and
deliver to Parent not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date a statement which fairly and accurately presents the Companys good faith
best estimate (based on reasonable assumptions) of the unrestricted cash and
cash equivalents held by the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing
and the Indebtedness Adjustment Amount (the "Closing Date Cash and Debt
Statement"). The Closing Date Cash and Debt Statement shall be prepared by
the Company in accordance with GAAP as consistently applied by the Company on
a basis consistent with the Financials. Such Closing Date Cash and Debt
Statement shall be certified by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company as
having been prepared in accordance with the foregoing principles. Any
Indebtedness that is not reflected on the Closing Date Cash and Debt Statement
and thus not part of the estimated Indebtedness Adjustment Amount reflected
therein, if any (the "Excess Debt"), shall be paid out of the Escrow Amount
and shall not be subject to the Deductible Amount.

 

5.14 _Expenses_.

(a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, each party shall be responsible
for its own expenses and costs that it incurs with respect to the negotiation,
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent shall be responsible for the filing fee for the Notification and
Report Forms filed with the FTC and DOJ under the HSR Act, and all premerger
notification and reports forms under similar applicable laws of other
jurisdictions, in each case pursuant to Section 5.4(b) hereof. Without
limiting or expanding the foregoing, the Company shall be responsible for all
fees and expenses incurred by or on its behalf in connection with the Merger
including all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting, finders and
all other fees and expenses of third parties incurred by the Company in
connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,

 



77  as well as the expenses listed on Schedule 5.14 (collectively, the "Third
Party Expenses"); _provided_ , that the method of payment of the Banker
Contingent Fees shall be as described in Section 1.7.

(b) The Company shall provide Parent with a statement of Estimated
Third Party Expenses showing detail of both the paid and unpaid Third Party
Expenses incurred by the Company as of the Closing Date, or anticipated to be
incurred by the Company after the Closing (other than Banker Contingent Fees),
not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date in a form
acceptable to Parent (the "Statement of Expenses") and the Statement of
Expenses shall be certified as true and correct as of the Closing Date by the
Companys Chief Executive Officer to his Knowledge. The Statement of Expenses
will reflect all Third Party Expenses incurred or expected to be incurred by
the Company as a result of the negotiation and effectuation of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including any Third Party Expenses
anticipated to be incurred after the Closing, other than Banker Contingent
Fees). Any Third Party Expenses incurred by the Company that are not reflected
on the Statement of Expenses and were not paid by the Company prior to the
Closing Date, and thus are not part of the Third Party Expense Adjustment
Amount, if any (the "Excess Third Party Expenses"), shall be paid out of the
Escrow Amount and shall not be subject to the Deductible Amount, except that
Banker Contingent Fees shall be satisfied solely in the manner described in
Section 1.7.

(c) The Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that Third Party
Expenses (other than Banker Contingent Fees) shall not be incurred by the
Company or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation after the Closing Date
without the express prior written consent of Parent.

5.15 _Spreadsheet._ The Company shall deliver to Parent and the Exchange
Agent a spreadsheet (the "Spreadsheet") in a form acceptable to Parent, which
spreadsheet shall be certified as complete and correct by the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company as of the Closing and which shall include as of the
Closing: (i) all Shareholders and their respective addresses, indicating
whether such holder is a current or former employee of the Company, or not;
the number of shares of Company Capital Stock held by such persons (including
whether such shares are Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred
Stock, the respective certificate numbers; the date of acquisition of such
shares; the formulas for the calculation of the percentage of Total Closing
Cash Consideration, Total CY12 Earnout Consideration, Total CY13 Earnout
Consideration and any Escrow Release to be paid to such holder; and such other
information relevant thereto or which Parent or the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request; (ii) all holders of Company Vested Options and their
respective addresses, indicating whether each such holder is a current or
former employee of the Company or not; the number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying each such Company Vested Option; the grant dates of such
Company Vested Options and the vesting arrangement with respect to such
Company Vested Options and indicating the strike price for each Company Vested
Option; whether such Company Vested Options are incentive stock options or
non-qualified stock options; the formulas for the calculation of the portion
of Total Closing Cash Consideration, Total CY12 Earnout Consideration, Total
CY13 Earnout Consideration and any Escrow Release to be paid with respect to
such Company Option; and such other information relevant thereto or which
Parent may reasonably request; (iii) the Parent Common Stock due to such

 



78  Effective Time Holders pursuant to the Stock Consideration Agreements; and
(iv) the formulas for calculation of the Banker Contingent Fees. The Company
shall deliver the Spreadsheet on or prior to the date three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date.

5.16 _FIRPTA Compliance_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to

its Subsidiaries to execute a resignation letter in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit F (the "Director and Officer Resignation Letter"), effective as of

necessary to achieve the requirement set forth in Section 6.2(n).

 

5.19 _Parent Board Observer_. Following the Effective Time and until the
determination of the Final CY13 EBIT in accordance with Section 1.6(e)
hereof, David Roberts shall be invited to attend and participate in all
meetings of the Board of Directors of Parent as an observer and, in this
respect, shall be entitled to receive copies of all agendas, notices,
minutes, consents and all other materials provided to the members of the Board
of Directors of Parent, _provided_ that the Board of Directors of Parent or
the Chief Executive Officer of Parent may withhold such board materials
and excuse David Roberts from portions of such meetings in each case that (a)
do not relate to PopCap Studio or the earnout provided for in this Agreement
and the Board of Directors of Parent determines are sensitive or (b) relate to
a dispute or potential dispute concerning PopCap Studio or the earnout
provided for in this Agreement. David Roberts will treat all information
obtained in connection with these board observer rights as confidential and
pursuant to the confidentiality obligations David Roberts entered into in
connection with his employment with Parent. If for any reason David Roberts
ceases to be an employee of PopCap Studio, then he shall lose all rights set
forth in this Section 5.19 and provided that he or she is reasonably
acceptable to the Board of Directors of Parent, the Earnout Representative
shall become the Parent board observer as designated pursuant to this Section
5.19 in lieu of David Roberts.

 

5.20 _Maintenance of Parent Form S-8_. Parent will use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain effectiveness of the Parent Form S-8 for so long as any
Parent Restricted Stock Units remain outstanding and will reserve a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock for issuance upon exercise thereof.

 

 __5.21 _D andO Indemnification._

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers of the Company (each, a "Company
Indemnified Party") as provided in the

 



79  Articles of Incorporation, the Company bylaws or in separate agreements
between the Company and individual officers and directors, shall continue to
be binding upon by the Surviving Corporation, and, for a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time, Parent will fulfill and honor in all respects
such obligations in accordance with the terms thereof in each case in effect
on the date hereof, and for such six (6) year period such rights will
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms
and shall not be amended, repealed or modified so as to adversely affect any
Company Indemnified Party; _provided_ that such indemnification shall
be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under Legal
Requirement. Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under this Section 5.21, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, and shall deliver to Parent and the Surviving Corporation the
undertaking contemplated by Washington Law; _provided further_ that the
failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 5.21 except (and only) to the extent such
failure to notify materially prejudices Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) This Section 5.21 shall survive consummation of the Merger and is intended
to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and representatives and the Company
(whether or not parties to this Agreement) and shall not be amended on or
after the Effective Time without the consent of all Company
Indemnified Parties. The rights of this Section 5.21 shall be in addition to
any rights such persons may have under the Articles of Incorporation or
Company bylaws or the articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
any subsidiary of the Company, or under Washington Law or any other
applicable laws or under any agreement of any Company Indemnified Party with
the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

5.22 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods_. Parent shall prepare or cause to
be prepared, in a manner consistent with past practices, procedures and
accounting methods of the Company and its Subsidiaries except as otherwise
required by Legal Requirements, and shall file or cause to be filed, all
Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods
which are filed after the Closing Date. Parent shall provide the Shareholder
Representative with copies of any income or other Returns to be filed by
Parent at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof (giving effect
to any extensions thereto) or, if required to be filed within thirty (30) days
after the Closing Date, as soon as possible following the Closing Date and
sufficiently in advance of filing that the Shareholder Representative shall
have a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Returns. If the
Shareholder Representative disputes any amount shown on such items in such
Returns, Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall consult and resolve
in good faith any issues arising as a result of the review of such Returns. If
the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within thirty (30) days after
the Shareholder Representatives receipt of such Returns, (or, if earlier,
the due date of such Returns (giving effect to any extensions thereto)), such
Returns shall be filed in accordance with Parents good faith determination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Shareholder Representative
agree that, if the Shareholder Representative and Parent are unable to resolve
a dispute and the Returns are filed in accordance with Parents good faith
determination, (x) the position taken by Parent on such Returns shall not, on
its own, determine, be

 



80  deemed to determine, or be deemed to represent the consent of the
Shareholder Representative as to whether a claim for indemnification exists
under Section 7.2(a), nor, if such a claim for indemnification is found to
exist, the amount of Losses incurred or sustained by the Indemnified Parties
under such a claim, and (y) for purposes of a claim for indemnification under
Section 7.2(a), such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the
procedures of Article VII, except that the arbitrator for this purpose shall
be a nationally recognized Big Four accounting firm mutually acceptable to
both parties, and further that in resolving any such dispute the arbitrator
shall adopt the Tax position that is "more likely than not to be sustained,"
and shall assume that the matter has already been identified by the
appropriate Taxing Authority.

 

(b) _Amended Returns_. Parent shall not file or cause to be filed any amended
Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, for purposes of
this Section 5.22(b), under any voluntary disclosure program, it being
understood that Parent shall be entitled to initiate participation in a
voluntary disclosure program with regards to items identified on Schedule
7.2(a)(vi)) that would have the effect of increasing the Indemnifying Parties
liability for indemnification under Section 7.2 hereof without consulting the
Shareholder Representative. If such amended Returns amend items that could
give rise to an indemnifiable obligation under Article VII hereof, Parent
shall provide the Shareholder Representative with copies of any such amended
Returns to be filed by the Parent sufficiently in advance of filing that the
Shareholder Representative shall have a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any items on such amended Returns that could give rise to an
indemnifiable obligation under Article VII hereof. If the Shareholder
Representative does not provide comments on such amended Returns within
thirty (30) days after its receipt of such Returns, the Parent shall be
entitled to file such amended Return promptly after the end of that thirty
(30) day period and the Shareholder Representative shall be deemed to have
consented to the amount of any Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax liability shown on
such Return for purposes of Section 7.2(a)(vi) hereof. If the Shareholder
Representative disputes any amount shown on such amended Returns that could
give rise to an indemnifiable obligation under Article VII hereof, Parent and
the Shareholder Representative shall consult and resolve in good faith any
issues arising as a result of such dispute. If the parties are unable to
resolve any dispute within thirty (30) days after the Shareholder
Representatives receipt of such amended Returns, Parent may file such amended
Returns in accordance with Parents good faith determination. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent and the Shareholder Representative agree that, if the
Shareholder Representative and Parent are unable to resolve any dispute
relating to the amended Returns and the amended Returns are filed in
accordance with the Parents good faith determination, (x) the position taken
by Parent on such amended Returns shall not, on its own, determine, be deemed
to determine, or be deemed to represent the consent of the Shareholder
Representative as to whether a claim for indemnification exists under Section
7.2(a), nor, if such a claim for indemnification is found to exist, the amount
of Losses incurred or sustained by the Indemnified Parties under such a claim,
and (y) for purposes of a claim for indemnification under Section 7.2(a),
such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures of Article
VII, except that the arbitrator for this purpose shall be a nationally
recognized Big Four accounting firm mutually acceptable to both parties, and
further that in resolving any such dispute the arbitrator shall adopt the Tax
position that is "more likely than not to be sustained," and shall assume that
the matter has already been identified by the appropriate Taxing Authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 5.22 shall not
apply

 



81  with respect to any amended Return required as a result of a final
determination of a Tax Authority, in which case Parent shall be entitled to
file such amended Return without the Shareholder Representatives review and
comment.

(c) _Tax Proceedings_. Parent shall promptly notify the
Shareholder Representative in writing upon receipt by Parent, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries of any written notice of a Tax Proceeding that could
give rise to a claim for indemnification under Article VII. Parent shall have
the right to control the conduct of any such Tax Proceeding. Parent shall,
however, keep the Shareholder Representative informed of all developments on a
timely basis, shall provide to the Shareholder Representative copies of any
and all correspondence received from the Tax Authority related to such Tax
Proceeding and shall provide the Shareholder Representative with the
opportunity to attend conferences, hearings and other meetings with or
involving the Tax Authority and to review and provide comments with respect
to written responses provided to the Tax Authority with respect to such Tax
Proceeding. Parent shall not settle any such Tax Proceeding without consulting
the Shareholder Representative. To the extent that control or settlement
rights with respect to a Tax Proceeding pursuant to this Section 5.22(b) may
overlap with a control or settlement right under Article VII, the provisions
of this Section 5.22(b) shall govern such Tax Proceeding control or
settlement right. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Shareholder
Representative agree that, if the Shareholder Representative and the Parent
are unable to resolve a dispute with respect to the settlement of any Tax
Proceeding, and such Tax Proceeding is settled in accordance with the
Parents good faith determination, (x) the position taken by Parent in such
Tax Proceeding shall not, on its own, determine, be deemed to determine, or be
deemed to represent the consent of the Shareholder Representative as to
whether a claim for indemnification exists under Section 7.2(a), nor, if such
a claim for indemnification is found to exist, the amount of Losses incurred
or sustained by the Indemnified Parties under such a claim, and (y) for
purposes of a claim for indemnification under Section 7.2(a), such dispute
shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures of Article VII, provided,
however, that in resolving any such dispute, the arbitrator shall adopt the
tax position that is "more likely than not to be sustained."

5.23 _D andO Tail Insurance Policy_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement/tail under the
Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage for
the Companys directors and officers which shall provide coverage for six (6)
years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage for,
and have other terms not materially less favorable to, the insured persons
than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently
maintained by the Company. The costs of such policy shall be a Third Party
Expense to the extent such costs are not paid prior to Closing.

 

5.24 _Additional Covenants_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
perform the actions set forth on Schedule 5.24.

qualifying such representations and warranties, shall be true and correct in
all respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time as
though made as of the Effective Time (other than those representations and
warranties of the Company

 



85  which speak as of a specified date, which shall be true and correct in all
respects as of such date), except where such failure to be so true and correct
would not reasonably be expected to not materially impair or delay Parents
or Subs ability to consummate the Merger, and (ii) each of Parent and Sub
shall have performed and complied in all respects with all covenants,
undertakings or other agreements applicable to it contained in this Agreement
required to be performed and complied with by such parties as of the Closing
Date, except for any non-compliance which, in the aggregate, is not material.

 

(b) _Certificate of Parent_ _._ The Company shall have received a certificate
executed on behalf of Parent by an officer of Parent to the effect that, as
of the Closing, the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) hereof have been
satisfied.

ARTICLE VII

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW

7.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. All
representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate delivered by a party pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Closing and shall terminate on, and no claim or action with
respect thereto may be brought after, the date that is twelve (12) months
after the Closing Date (such twelve (12)- month period, the "General Survival
Period"); _provided_ , _however_ , that representations and warranties
contained in Section 2.2 (Company Capital Structure), Section 2.4 (Authority)
and Section 3.2 (Authority) hereof (collectively, the "Fundamental
Representations") shall survive indefinitely and that the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in Section 2.11 (Tax Matters) hereof (the
"Tax Representations") shall survive until and shall terminate on the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including any extensions
or waivers thereof); _provided further_ , _however_ , that (A) all
representations, warranties and indemnity obligations shall survive beyond the
termination of the representation, warranty or indemnification obligation
pursuant to this Section 7.1 if a claim for indemnifiable Losses is made
hereunder by any Indemnified Party prior to the termination of such
representation, warranty or indemnity obligation, in which case the
indemnification obligations set forth in this Article VII shall continue with
respect to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved, and (B) the
termination of the representations, warranties or indemnification obligations
pursuant to this Section7.1 shall not affect the rights of any Indemnified
Party (under this Article VII or otherwise) to seek recovery of any
indemnifiable Losses arising out of any fraud by the Company, which rights
shall survive indefinitely and without limitation (subject to the applicable
statute of limitations). Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, claims
relating to any and all covenants and agreements of the parties contained in
this Agreement to be performed by the parties at or prior to the Closing Date
shall survive the Closing and shall terminate on, and no claim or action with
respect thereto may be brought after, the date that is twelve (12) months
after the Closing Date. All other covenants and agreements of the
parties contained in this Agreement shall survive indefinitely the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger.

 



86 7.2 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) After the Closing, and subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article VII, the Effective Time Holders (each, an "Indemnifying Party" and
collectively, the "Indemnifying Parties") agree to severally indemnify and
hold harmless Parent and its officers, directors, affiliates, employees,
agents and representatives, including the Surviving Corporation (each, an
"Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), against all
claims, losses, Liabilities, damages, deficiencies, Taxes, costs, interest,
awards, judgments, penalties and expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses and including any such reasonable expenses incurred in
connection with investigating any Third Party Claim and defending against or
settling any of the foregoing, but excluding exemplary or punitive damages
(except for exemplary or punitive damages actually paid by an Indemnified
Party to any third party with respect to a Third Party Claim) and for claims
to the extent outside of the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(iv)
through Section 7.2(a)(vi) hereof, inclusive, excluding consequential damages
(hereinafter individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") incurred or
sustained by the Indemnified Parties, or any of them (including the Surviving
Corporation), as a result of:

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy as of the date hereof or as of the Effective
Time in any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement or the Closing Certificates;

(ii) any failure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to perform or
comply with any covenant, undertaking or other agreement applicable to it
contained in this Agreement;

 

(iii) any fraud committed by the Company in connection with this Agreement or
the Closing Certificates;

 

(iv) any payments properly paid with respect to Dissenting Shares to the
extent that such payments, in the aggregate, exceed the amount, in the
aggregate, that otherwise would have been payable pursuant to Section 1.6
hereof upon the exchange of such Dissenting Shares and any cost and expenses
defending any claim involving Dissenting Shares;

 

(v) any Excess Third Party Expenses, any Excess Debt and the amount, if any,
by which the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held by the Company as
set forth on the Closing Date Cash and Debt Statement exceeds the actual
amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held by the Company as of the
Closing Date as calculated in accordance with GAAP as consistently applied by
the Company on a basis consistent with the Financials;

(vi) any Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A) attributable to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than Taxes incurred on the Closing Date
attributable to the actions of Parent after the Closing that are outside the
ordinary course of business or Transaction Payroll Taxes), it
being understood that, in the case of Taxes based upon income, sales,
proceeds, profits, receipts, wages, compensation or similar items, the amount
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the Closing Date shall be
determined on the basis of a closing of the books as of the close

 



87  of business on the Closing Date, except that any deductions attributable to
the exercise or cashout of Company Options arising after June 13, 2011 shall
not be considered to reduce the amount of any Tax liability for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, but shall instead be allocated to the period beginning after the
Closing Date for purposes of determining the existence and the amount of an
indemnifiable Loss hereunder (irrespective of the appropriate tax reporting
treatment which shall be determined in the sole discretion of Parent), and the
amount of any other Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
attributable to such Tax period shall equal the amount of such Tax for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the taxable period up to and including the Closing Date,
and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the taxable
period), (B) any Taxes as a result of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
being (or ceasing to be) on or prior to the Closing Date (1) a member of an
affiliated or combined group pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6
or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law prior to the Closing
Date or (2) a transferee or successor by contract or otherwise, which relate
to an event occurring on or before the Closing Date, (C) as a result of an
express or implied obligation arising on or prior to Closing Date to
indemnify or otherwise assume or succeed to the Taxes of any other Person, or
(D) any transfer or other Taxes arising directly (or indirectly) as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any ancillary
agreement, including any such Taxes for which the Shareholders and holders of
Company Options are responsible pursuant to Section 1.9(d) hereof;
notwithstanding the foregoing, no claim may be made for any Loss attributable
to a Tax liability specifically identified by item and amount on Schedule
7.2(a)(vi), except to the extent such Loss exceeds the amount so identified;
and

 

(vii) the matters set forth on Schedule 7.2(a)(vii).

The Indemnifying Parties (including any officer or director of the Company)
shall not have any right of contribution, indemnification or right of
advancement from the Surviving Corporation or Parent with respect to any Loss
claimed by an Indemnified Party.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Article VII only, once
it has been established that there has been any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty, or any failure by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to perform or comply with any covenant, undertaking or other
agreement, solely for the purpose of determining the amount of Losses suffered
as a result of any such breach, inaccuracy or failure (separate and apart from
establishing that there has been any breach of or inaccuracy in
any representation or warranty, or any failure to perform or comply with any
covenant, undertaking or other agreement by the Company), any representation,
warranty, covenant, undertaking or agreement given or made by the Company that
is qualified or limited in scope as to materiality, "Company Material Adverse
Effect" or similar qualifications shall be deemed to be made or given without
such qualification for the purpose of determining the amount of such Losses.

 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or any other
Indemnified Party to pursue remedies under any Related Agreement against the
parties thereto.

 



88 7.3 _Maximum Payments; Remedy_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time, except in the case of fraud by the Company,
claims for injunctive relief or specific performance, claims for breaches or
inaccuracies of the Fundamental Representations or the Tax Representations and
claims for indemnity pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(ii) through Section 7.2(a)(vi)
hereof, inclusive (collectively, the "Special Matters"), claims against the
Escrow Fund shall be the Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive remedy for
the Indemnifying Parties indemnity claims under Section 7.2(a)(i)
and Section 7.2(a)(vii) hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations
set forth in this Section 7.3(a) shall not apply to claims for indemnity
pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(ii) through Section 7.2(a)(vi) hereof, inclusive.

(b) Following the Effective Time, except in the case of fraud by the Company,
the aggregate liability for all claims of indemnity for breaches or
inaccuracies of the Tax Representations and pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(vi)
hereof shall be (i) $100.0 million for claims made pursuant to an Officers
Certificate delivered prior to the later of eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date and the completion of the first full audit cycle for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods with respect to the corporate income Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries filed in the United States, Canada or Ireland
and (ii) $20.0 million for claims made thereafter. In the case of any claim
for indemnification with respect to any Special Matter, a claim for
indemnification under this Article VII shall remain the exclusive remedy for
Parent and the Indemnified Parties. In such an event, the Indemnified Parties
shall first seek recovery of Losses from the Escrow Fund. If recovery of
indemnifiable Losses from the Escrow Fund is not sufficient to satisfy
the Indemnifying Parties indemnity obligations under this Agreement, the
Indemnified Parties may seek recovery from the Indemnifying Parties according
to their respective Pro Rata Portions of such Losses.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, except in
the case of fraud by the Company, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to claims that are made pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i)
hereof only if the aggregate Losses under such claim together with any prior
claims for Losses exceed $1.0 million (the "Basket"), at which time the
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified, subject to the terms
of this Article VII, for all such Losses (including the amount of the Basket).

 

(d) For purposes of this Article VII, any individual claim for Losses or
series of related claims based on a similar set of operative facts that is
less than $10,000 (the "De Minimis Amount") shall be disregarded; _provided_ ,
_however_ that any series of claims for Losses based on a similar set of
operative facts shall be aggregated and treated as a single claim.

(e) In no event shall the aggregate liability of any Indemnifying Party for
all claims of indemnification under this Agreement exceed the amount of
consideration actually received by such Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section
1.6 hereof, and no Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any Losses in excess
of such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of such Losses; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of an
Indemnifying Party in connection with a claim based on fraud committed by such
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ ,  _further_ that the limitations in this
Section 7.3(e) shall not apply to claims settled by recourse to the Escrow
Fund.

 



89 (f) The Indemnified Parties shall act in good faith and in a commercially
reasonable manner to mitigate as required by law any Losses they may suffer.
Losses in respect of a matter shall be reduced by the amount of any insurance
proceeds actually received by Parent or its subsidiaries with respect to such
matter, less any costs of recovery (including any increase in insurance
premiums). Applicable insurance coverage Parent or its subsidiaries for any
Losses shall be pursued in good faith by Parent, including without limitation
compliance with notice, consent, and defense provisions. 

(g) In the case of any claim not made against the Escrow Fund, Parent shall be
entitled to bring such claim against any or all of the Indemnifying Parties,
and each Indemnifying Party shall be liable for its respective Pro Rata
Portion of the total liability owed to the Indemnified Parties in respect of
such a claim (except that the foregoing shall not limit the liability of an
Indemnifying Party who has committed fraud in connection with this Agreement).

(h) Nothing in this Article VII shall limit the liability of the Company or
the Indemnifying Parties for any breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement, any Related Agreements or in any
certificates or other instruments delivered pursuant to this Agreement if the
Merger does not close.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties hereto agree
and acknowledge that any Indemnified Party may bring a claim for
indemnification for any Loss under this Article VII notwithstanding the fact
that such Indemnified Party had knowledge of the breach, event
or circumstance giving rise to such Loss prior to the Closing or waived any
condition to the Closing related thereto.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
Indemnified Party shall have any right to seek or obtain indemnification under
this Agreement for any Loss or alleged Loss by such Indemnified Party, and
such Loss shall not be included in meeting the Basket in Section 7.3(c)
hereof, to the extent the dollar amount of such Loss reduced the Total Closing
Consideration because it was included in the Third Party Expense Adjustment
Amount or the Indebtedness Adjustment Amount reflected in the Closing Date
Cash and Debt Statement.

__7.4 _Claims for Indemnification._

(a) _Claims for Indemnification_. To assert a claim for indemnification under
this Article VII, Parent (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Party)
must deliver to the Shareholder Representative (and the Indemnifying Party in
the event that indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from
such Indemnifying Party) a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an
"Officers Certificate") (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid,
sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or reasonably anticipates that
it will have to pay, sustain, incur, or accrue indemnifiable Losses as a
result of facts, circumstances, events or occurrences existing prior to the
date of such Officers Certificate; (ii) stating the amount of such
indemnifiable Losses to the extent known at the time of such Officers
Certificate; and (iii) describing in reasonable detail the indemnifiable
Losses included in the amount so stated, including the date each such item was
paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or the basis for such
anticipated liability, and the nature of

 



90  the claim to which such indemnifiable Losses are related. Such Officers
Certificate must be delivered (x) on or prior to the last day of the General
Survival Period for claims for indemnity pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i)
(excluding claims for breaches or inaccuracies of the Fundamental
Representations or the Tax Representations) and Section 7.2(a)(ii), and (y)
prior to the expiration of all applicable statute of limitations for claims
for breaches or inaccuracies of the Tax Representations or any other claims
for indemnity under this Article VII.

(b) _Objections to Claims_. At the time of delivery of any Officers
Certificate to the Shareholder Representative (if such delivery is on or prior
to expiration of the General Survival Period), a duplicate copy of such
certificate shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent, and for a period of thirty
(30) days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to
Parent of any escrow amount pursuant to this Section 7.4 unless the Escrow
Agent shall have received written authorization from the Shareholder
Representative to make such delivery. After the expiration of such thirty
(30)-day period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery of cash from the Escrow
Fund equal to the amount of Losses claimed in the Officers Certificate in
accordance with this Section 7.4 (or in the event that indemnification is
being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying
Party shall pay its Pro Rata Share of such Losses if it has not objected to
such claim within such thirty (30)-day period); _provided_ , _however_ that no
such payment or delivery may be made if and to the extent the Shareholder
Representative has objected in a written statement to any claim or claims made
in the Officers Certificate (an "Escrow Claim Objection Notice"), and such
Objection Notice shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and Parent
prior to the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period.

(c) _Resolution of Objections to Claims_.

(i) If the Shareholder Representative delivers an Escrow Claim Objection
Notice to Parent within thirty (30) days after receipt from Parent of an
Officers Certificate pursuant to Section 7.4(a) hereof, or in the event that
indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party,
if such Indemnifying Party shall object to any claim or claims made in any
Officers Certificate to recover claims directly from such Indemnifying Party
within thirty (30) days after delivery of such Officers Certificate, the
Shareholder Representative (or such objecting Indemnifying Party) and Parent
shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties
with respect to each of such claims. If the Shareholder Representative (or
such objecting Indemnifying Party) and Parent should so agree, a memorandum
setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and,
in the case of a claim against the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the
Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum and shall make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the terms thereof. In the event that indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party shall
pay its Pro Rata Share of such Losses once the objection has been resolved.

(ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and
prior to thirty (30) days after delivery of an Escrow Claim Objection Notice,
such dispute shall be resolved in the manner set forth in Section 9.7. Any
resolution made pursuant to Section 9.7 hereto 

 



91  shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties to this Agreement
and the Indemnifying Parties. Such decision shall be written and shall be
supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth
the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator, and the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and make distributions from the Escrow
Fund in accordance with, the terms of such award, judgment, decree or order
as applicable. Within thirty (30) days of a decision of the arbitrator
requiring payment by one party to another, such party shall make the payment
to such other party, including any distributions out of the Escrow Fund. 

(d) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third party
claim (a "Third Party Claim") that Parent reasonably believes may result in a
demand against the Escrow Fund or for other indemnification pursuant to this
Article VII, Parent shall timely notify the Shareholder Representative (or, in
the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party) of such claim, and the
Shareholder Representative shall have the right to receive copies of all
pleadings, notices and communications with respect to the Third Party Claim
except to the extent that receipt of such documents would waive any claim of
privilege by such Indemnified Party and such Indemnified Partys counsel and
representation by such counsel of both parties would be inappropriate under
applicable standards of professional conduct. The Shareholder Representative
shall be entitled on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties (or, in the event
indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying
Party, such Indemnifying Party shall be entitled), at their expense, to
participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third
Party Claim. The failure to so notify the Shareholder Representative shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Parties of any Liability, except to the extent and
only to the extent the Shareholder Representative demonstrates that the
defense of such Third Party Claim is actually and materially prejudiced
thereby. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the
defense of, and to settle any such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, except with the consent of the Shareholder Representative (or, in the
event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying
Party, such Indemnifying Party) (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) no such settlement shall be determinative of the amount of any
Losses or whether such Losses shall be indemnifiable pursuant to this Article
VII. If there is a Third Party Claim that, if adversely determined would give
rise to a right of recovery for Losses hereunder, then any amounts incurred or
accrued by the Indemnified Parties in defense of such Third Party
Claim, regardless of the outcome of such claim, shall be deemed Losses
hereunder. In the event that the Shareholder Representative has consented in
writing to any settlement of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Parties
shall have no power or authority to object under any provision of this
Article VII to the amount of any claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund with
respect to such settlement.

__7.5 _Escrow Arrangements._

(a) _Escrow Fund_. By virtue of this Agreement and as partial security for
the indemnity obligations provided for in Section 7.2 hereof, at the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit the Escrow Amount in immediately available funds
with the Escrow Agent, such deposit of the Escrow Amount to constitute an
escrow fund to be governed by the terms set forth herein. The Escrow Amount
(plus any interest paid on such Escrow Amount in accordance with 

 



92  Section 7.5(d)(ii) hereof, the "Escrow Fund") shall be available to
compensate Parent (on behalf of itself and any other Indemnified Party) for
any claims by such parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by them and
for which they are entitled to recovery under this Article VII. The Escrow
Agent may execute this Agreement following the date hereof and prior to the
Closing, and such later execution, if so executed after the date hereof,
shall not affect the binding nature of this Agreement as of the date hereof
between the other signatories hereto.

(b) _Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Periods_. Subject
to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence
immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m.,
local time at Parents corporate headquarters in California, on the last day
of the General Survival Period. After Closing, Parent shall provide the Escrow
Agent with a certificate setting forth the Closing Date and the date of the
last day of the General Survival Period. The Escrow Agent shall distribute the
funds in the Escrow Fund ( _less_ the amount of any Representative Expenses
submitted to the Escrow Agent in a certificate by the
Shareholder Representative pursuant to Section 7.6(f) or by the Earnout
Representative pursuant to Section 1.6(e)(ix) prior to such distribution) to
the Indemnifying Parties within five (5) Business Days following delivery of
the spreadsheet to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 7.5(c); _provided,
however_ , that the Escrow Fund shall not terminate with respect to any amount
in respect of any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers
Certificate ("Unresolved Claims") delivered to the Escrow Agent and the
Shareholder Representative prior to the end of the General Survival Period
with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to the end of the
General Survival Period, and any such amount shall not be distributed to the
Indemnifying Parties at such time. As soon as all such claims have been
resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining portion of the Escrow
Fund, if any, not required to satisfy such or any other Unresolved Claims.
Any distribution of funds from the Escrow Fund to the Indemnifying Parties
pursuant to this Section 7.5(b) shall be referred to herein as an "Escrow
Release."

 

(c) _Escrow Releases_. The funds distributed in each Escrow Release shall be
distributed to the Indemnifying Parties as follows:

(i) in respect of each former share of Company Series A Preferred Stock, the
amount determined by applying the Preferred Distribution Mechanism to such
Escrow Release, and

(ii) in respect of each former share of Company Common Stock (including those
shares underlying Company Vested Options), the amount determined by applying
the Common Distribution Mechanism to such Escrow Release.

Parent shall provide the Escrow Agent with a spreadsheet for each Escrow
Release stating the amounts to be distributed to each Indemnifying Party.

 



93 (d) _Protection of Escrow Fund_.

 

(i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund and shall treat
such fund as a trust fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
shall hold and dispose of such fund only in accordance with the terms of this
Article VII.

 

(ii) Parent and the Shareholder Representative hereby direct the Escrow Agent
to invest the Escrow Amount in a U.S. Bank Money Market Deposit Account, as
fully described in Exhibit D attached hereto and any interest paid on such
Escrow Amount shall be added to the Escrow Fund and become a part thereof and
available for satisfaction of claims. The parties hereto agree that Parent
shall be treated as the owner of any cash in the Escrow Fund for Tax purposes,
and that all interest on or other taxable income, if any, earned from the
investment of such cash pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for Tax
purposes as earned by Parent. Within sixty (60) days after the end of any
quarter of any taxable year of Parent, Parent shall request in writing that
the Escrow Agent disburse from the Escrow Amount a distribution equal to 40%
of any income taxable to Parent pursuant to the preceding sentence. The
Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates may receive compensation with respect to
any investment directed hereunder. The Escrow Agent will act upon investment
instructions the day that such instructions are received, provided the
requests are communicated within a sufficient amount of time to allow the
Escrow Agent to make the specified investment. Instructions received after an
applicable investment cutoff deadline will be treated as being received by
the Escrow Agent on the next business day, and the Escrow Agent shall not be
liable for any loss arising directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from
the inability to invest funds on the day the instructions are received. The
Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss incurred by the actions of
third parties or for any loss arising by error, failure or delay in the making
of an investment or reinvestment, and the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for
any loss of principal or income in connection therewith, unless such error,
failure or delay results from the Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful
misconduct. As and when the Escrow Amount and any interest or income thereon
is to be released under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall cause the
investments to be converted into cash in accordance with its customary
procedures and shall not be liable for any loss of principal or income in
connection therewith. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss of
principal or income due to the choice of investment in which the Escrow Amount
is invested or the choice of investments converted into cash pursuant to this
Section 7.5.

 

(e) _Escrow Agent s Duties_.

(i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such
duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any
additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive
after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and
the Shareholder Representative, and may rely and shall be protected in relying
or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as
escrow agent except for gross negligence or willful misconduct. Any act done
or omitted pursuant to the advice or opinion of counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of the good faith of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall in no
case or event be liable for any

 



94  representations or warranties of the other parties to this Agreement, or for
punitive, incidental or consequential damages.

 

(ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all
warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other Person, excepting
only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to
comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court, rewards of
arbitrators and joint written instructions of Parent and the Shareholder
Representative. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such
order, judgment or decree of any court, reward of arbitrator, instructions or
certificate, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto
or to any other Person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such
order, judgment, decree or award being subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without
jurisdiction.

 

(iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the
identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or
purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers
deposited or called for hereunder.

 

(iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights
under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any
documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

(v) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not
be liable to any party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to
act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in
reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit
provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith
believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for
forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any
representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with legal
counsel in connection with performing the Escrow Agents duties under this
Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or
permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel.
The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying
the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any
party to this Agreement.

(vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with
any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or
conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy
or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all documents
and the Escrow Fund, and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by
final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agents
discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damages.
Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of
interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and
rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the
clerk of the court all documents and the Escrow Amounts held in escrow, except
all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the
Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action (the "Agent

 



95  Interpleader Expenses") and which the parties agree to pay as follows: 50%
to be paid by Parent and 50% to be paid from the Escrow Fund.

 

(vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns agree jointly
and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable costs
of investigation, counsel fees, including allocated costs of in-house counsel
and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow
Agent in connection with the performance of his/her duties under this
Agreement, including any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving
its subject matter, other than those determined by a court to arise out of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent (the "Agent
Indemnification Expenses"); _provided_ , that as between the Parent and
Shareholder Representative, 50% of the Agent Indemnification Expenses be paid
by Parent and 50% be paid from the Escrow Fund. The indemnities provided in
this Section 7.5(e)(vii) shall survive the termination of this Agreement or
any removal or resignation of the Escrow Agent.

 

(viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty
(30) days written notice to the Parent and the Shareholder Representative;
_provided, however_ , that no such resignation shall become effective until
the appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as
follows: Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow
agent within 30 days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree
upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have
the right to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in
the State of California. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver
an instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, without further acts,
be vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the
predecessor escrow agent as if originally named as escrow agent. Upon
appointment of a successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged
from any further duties and liability under this Agreement.

(f) _Fees_. Parent shall pay the Escrow Agent such fees and reimburse the
Escrow Agent for such expenses as are established and contemplated by the Fee
Schedule attached hereto as Schedule 7.5(f). It is understood that the fees
and usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be
considered compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly
fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this
Agreement but that has been requested by an officer of Parent, or if the
parties request a substantial modification of the terms of this Agreement, or
if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or
intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject
matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such
extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys fees,
including allocated costs of in-house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such
default, delay, controversy or litigation.

(g) _Successor Escrow Agents_. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in
its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its

  



96  individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation to which
substantially all the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent in its
individual capacity may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this
Escrow Agreement without further act.

(h) _Tax Reporting Matters_. Parent and the Shareholder Representative (on
behalf of each of the Indemnifying Parties) each agree to provide the Escrow
Agent with certified tax identification numbers for each of them by furnishing
appropriate Forms W-9 (or Forms W-8, in the case of non-U.S. persons) and
other forms and documents that the Escrow Agent may reasonably request
(collectively, "Tax Reporting Documentation") to the Escrow Agent within
thirty (30) days after the date on which the first deposit of the Escrow
Amount is made with the Escrow Agent. The parties hereto understand that, if
such Tax Reporting Documentation is not so certified to the Escrow Agent, the
Escrow Agent may be required by the Code to withhold a portion of any payments
made to such Indemnifying Party who has not provided such Tax Reporting
Documentation pursuant to this Agreement. If the date of a payment from the
Escrow Fund occurs more than six months after the date on which the first
deposit of the Escrow Amount is made with the Escrow Agent, a portion of the
payment will be treated as imputed interest to the extent required under the
Code.

 

 __7.6 _Shareholder Representative._

(a) The approval of this Agreement by the Shareholders shall constitute their
ratification and approval of the appointment of the Shareholder Representative
pursuant to this Agreement to act on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties,
which shall include the power and authority (on all matters other than those
designated to the Earnout Representative pursuant to Section 1.6(e)):

 

(i) for purposes of this Article VII, to give and receive notices and
communications, to authorize delivery to any Indemnified Party of cash from
the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by an Indemnified Party, to object
to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and bring suit and comply with Orders and awards of courts
with respect to such claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate
in the judgment of the Shareholder Representative for the accomplishment of
the foregoing;

 

(ii) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this
Agreement and the Related Agreements and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby as the Shareholder Representative, in its sole
discretion, may deem necessary or desirable;

(iii) to enforce and protect the rights and interests of all Indemnifying
Parties arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement,
and any other document contemplated hereby, and to take any and all actions
which the Shareholder Representative believes are necessary or appropriate
under this Agreement for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties;

(iv) to refrain from enforcing any right of the Indemnifying Parties or any of
them and/or the Shareholder Representative arising out of or under or in any
manner relating to this Agreement or any document contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such failure to act

 



97  on the part of the Shareholder Representative, except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by
the Shareholder Representative or by the Indemnifying Parties unless such
waiver is in writing signed by the waiving party or by the Stockholders
Representative; and

(v) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to
do any and all things and to take any and all action that the Shareholder
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or
proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and all other documents contemplated hereby.

(b) The Shareholder Representative may resign upon written notice to the
Surviving Corporation, with or without cause, and the holders representing a
majority of the Pro Rata Portions shall appoint a successor. Additionally, the
Shareholder Representative may be changed by the Indemnifying Parties upon
ten (10) days prior written notice to Parent, signed by the holders
representing a majority of the Pro Rata Portions. The outgoing Stockholders
Representative shall be entitled to immediate reimbursement of all
Shareholder Representative Expenses pursuant to Section 7.6(f) hereof. The
successor shall be entitled to all the rights, powers, immunities and
privileges as was his or her predecessor, without the need of any further act
or writing. No bond shall be required of the Shareholder Representative, and
the Shareholder Representative shall not receive compensation for his or her
services. Notices or communications to or from the Shareholder Representative
shall constitute notice to or from each of the Indemnifying Parties.

(c) The Shareholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Shareholder Representative while acting in good faith
(and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of such good faith) and without gross negligence or
willful misconduct. 

(d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative
with respect to the matters regarding the Escrow Fund contemplated by this
Section 7.6, including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.3 and Section 8.4 hereof, shall constitute a decision of
all of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be final, binding and conclusive,
and the Escrow Agent and the Indemnified Parties may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each Indemnifying Party.
The Escrow Agent and the Indemnified Parties are hereby relieved from any
Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative. 

(e) Parent and Sub, on behalf of all Indemnified Parties, hereby agree that
any notice, right, or obligation required to be delivered to, performed by,
or asserted by the Indemnifying Parties regarding the Escrow Fund shall be
delivered to, performed by or asserted by the Shareholder Representative.

 



98 (f) The Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify the Shareholder Representative
and hold the Shareholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability
or expense incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith
on the part of the Shareholder Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Shareholder
Representatives duties hereunder, including any out-of-pocket costs and the
reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Shareholder
Representative ("Shareholder Representative Expenses" and together with
Earnout Representative Expenses, the "Representative Expenses"). Following the
termination of the Escrow Fund, the resolution of all Unresolved Claims and
the satisfaction of all claims made by Indemnified Parties for Losses, the
Shareholder Representative shall have the right to recover Shareholder
Representative Expenses from the Escrow Fund prior to any distribution to the
Indemnifying Parties, and prior to any such distribution, shall deliver to
the Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth the Shareholder Representative
Expenses actually incurred, to the extent such Shareholder Representative
Expenses exceed the amount of the Representative Fund and if such
Shareholder Representative Expenses have not been paid directly to the
Shareholder Representative by the Indemnifying Parties. After the release of
the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Shareholder
Representative may seek recovery of any unpaid Shareholder Representative
Expenses from the Indemnifying Parties according to their respective Pro Rata
Portions.

(g) The Shareholder Representative may engage attorneys, accountants,
investment bankers, advisors, consultants and clerical personnel and obtain
such other professional and expert assistance, and maintain such records, as
the Shareholder Representative may deem necessary or desirable and incur
other out-of-pocket expenses related to performing its services hereunder,
with the fees and expenses of such engagements and assistance considered
Shareholder Representative Expenses. The Shareholder Representative may in
good faith rely conclusively upon information, reports, statements and
opinions prepared or presented by such professionals.

(h) The Shareholder Representative shall have reasonable access to information
about the Company and the reasonable assistance of the Surviving Corporations
officers and employees for purposes of performing his duties and exercising
his rights hereunder, _provided_ that the Shareholder Representative shall
treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about
the Surviving Corporation to anyone (except on a need to know basis to
individuals who agree to treat such information confidentially). The
Shareholder Representative shall be responsible for any breach of this Section
7.6(g) by individuals the Shareholder Representative shares such information
with and shall keep Parent promptly informed of those individuals the
Shareholder Representative shares such information with.

(i) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Representative Amount with
the Earnout Representative (the "Representative Fund"). If the Earnout
Representative ceases to be the Earnout Representative under this Agreement,
he or she shall transfer any amounts remaining in the Representative Fund to
the successor Earnout Representative. The Representative Fund (plus any
interest paid on such Representative Fund) shall be available to reimburse the
Earnout Representative or the Shareholder Representative, as applicable and in
each case on behalf of the 

 



99  Indemnifying Parties, for any Representative Expenses actually incurred
prior to the determination of Final CY13 EBIT in accordance with Section
1.6(e) hereof. Following such determination of Final CY13 EBIT, the Earnout
Representative shall distribute such portion of the Representative Fund which
has not been used to reimburse the Earnout Representative or the Shareholder
Representative for Representative Expenses, if any, to the Effective Time
Holders as if such distribution was an Escrow Release.

7.7 _Tax Consequences of Indemnification Payments_. Any payments made to an
Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification obligations under this
Article VII will be treated as adjustments to the purchase price for Tax
purposes and such agreed treatment will govern for purposes of this
Agreement, unless otherwise required by law.

7.8 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, this Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Indemnified Parties from and after the Effective Time for any
claims arising under this Agreement, including claims of inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that (i) this Section 7.8 shall not be deemed a waiver
by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief and
(ii) nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of an Indemnifying
Party (and this Article VII shall not be the sole and exclusive remedy in
respect of such Indemnifying Party) in connection with a claim based on fraud
committed by such Indemnifying Party.

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

8.1 _Termination_. Except as provided in Section 8.2 hereof, this Agreement
may be terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

(b) by Parent, if the Requisite Shareholder Consent shall not have been
obtained by the Company and delivered to Parent within twenty-four (24) hours
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company;

(c) by Parent or the Company if the Closing Date shall not have occurred
by October 11, 2011 (the "End Date"); _provided, however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(c) shall not be available to
any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or
resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date and such
action or failure to act constitutes breach of this Agreement;

(d) by Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any final, non-appealable Legal
Requirement, Order or other legal restraint which is in effect and which has
the effect of making the Merger illegal.

 



100  (e) by Parent if it is not in material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement and there has been a breach or inaccuracy of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement
such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) hereof would not be
satisfied and such breach or inaccuracy has not been cured within twenty (20)
calendar days after written notice thereof to the Company; _provided, however_
, that no cure period shall be required (i) for a breach or inaccuracy which
by its nature cannot be cured (ii) if any of the conditions to Closing in
Article VI for the benefit of Parent are incapable of being satisfied on or
before the End Date; or

(f) by the Company if it is not in material breach of its obligations under
this Agreement and there has been a breach or inaccuracy of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent contained in this
Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) hereof would
not be satisfied and such breach or inaccuracy has not been cured within
twenty (20) calendar days after written notice thereof to Parent;  _provided,
however_ , that no cure period shall be required (i) for a breach or
inaccuracy which by its nature cannot be cured (ii) if any of the conditions
to Closing in Article VI for the benefit of the Company are incapable of
being satisfied on or before the End Date.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.1 hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no Liability on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or their
respective officers, directors or shareholders, if applicable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each party hereto and each Person shall remain liable for any
willful breaches of this Agreement or any Related Agreement prior to its
termination; and _provided further_ , _however_ , that, the provisions of
Sections 5.2 (Confidentiality), 5.3 (Public Disclosure), 5.14 (Expenses) and
7.3(h) (Maximum Payments; Remedies) hereof, Article IX (General Provisions)
hereof and this Section 8.2 shall remain in full force and effect and survive
any termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of this Article VIII.

8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to Legal Requirements, this Agreement may be amended
by the parties hereto, by action duly authorized by the parties, at any time
before or after approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Shareholders;
_provided_ that after approval and adoption of this Agreement by the
Shareholders, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further
approval by the Shareholders without such further shareholder approval;
_provided further_ , that anything to the contrary in this Agreement
notwithstanding, no amendment of the definition of "Banker Contingent Fees" in
Section 1.6(a) hereof, or of either of the final two sentences of Section 1.7
hereof, or of this second proviso of this Section 8.3, or the last sentence of
Section 9.4 hereof may be adopted without the advance written approval of
Qatalyst Partners LP (in addition to the approval of the parties as specified
above). Except as otherwise set forth in Section 1.6(e) and Section 7.6, this
Agreement may not be amended except by execution of an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of Parent, Sub and the Company. The duties of the
Escrow Agent under this Agreement may be altered, amended, modified or revoked
only by a writing signed by Parent, the Escrow Agent and the Shareholder
Representative. 

 



101  8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent, on the one
hand, and the Company and the Shareholder Representative, on the other hand,

inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive
compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions for the benefit
of such party contained herein. Except as otherwise set forth in Section

writing signed on behalf of such party.

Any notice addressed to the Escrow Agent shall be effective only upon receipt.
If any certificate, notice, any objection thereto or any other document of
any kind is required to be delivered to the Escrow Agent and any other person,
the Escrow Agent may assume without inquiry that such certificate, notice,
objection or other document was received by such other person on the date on
which it was received by the Escrow Agent.

9.2 _Interpretation_. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when
used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



103  9.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

9.4 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the Exhibits hereto,
the Disclosure Schedule, the Confidential Disclosure Agreement, the Related
Agreements and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the
parties hereto referenced herein: (i) together constitute the entire agreement
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, (ii) are not intended
to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder (except that
Section 5.21 is intended to benefit indemnified persons from and after the
Closing), and (iii) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise,
except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate its obligations
hereunder to its affiliates as long as Parent remains ultimately liable for
all of Parents obligations hereunder. Clause (ii) above notwithstanding, the
parties agree that, even though the Companys investment banker (Qatalyst
Partners LP) is not a third party beneficiary of any of Parents or Companys
obligations under this Agreement, Qatalyst Partners LP will be entitled to
enforce its right to prioritized payment of Banker Contingent Fees under the
penultimate sentence of Section 1.7 hereof and to protection of such right
under the second proviso of Section 8.3 hereof.

 

9.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

9.6 _Other Remedies_. Except for the limitations on remedies set forth in
Article VII, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will
be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

9.7 _Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction_. Except to the extent a provision
of Article I of this Agreement is required by law to be governed by Washington
Law; all other provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Chancery Court and any appellate court
therefrom in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this
Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be
served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of
Delaware for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any
objection which they might

 



104   otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if (a) the Delaware Chancery Court does not accept
jurisdiction or (b) the dispute concerns any provision of Section 1.6(e)
hereof, including the determination of Final CY12 EBIT or Final CY13 EBIT
under Section 1.6(e) hereof or concerns Article VII hereof, whether relating
to claims upon the Escrow Fund or to the other indemnification obligations
set forth in Article VII hereof or otherwise, then the matter shall be
exclusively settled by non-appealable arbitration (x) before the Delaware
Chancery Court, under the rules set forth by the Delaware Chancery Court, in
the event that the amount in dispute is in excess of $1.0 million or (y)
before Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services in the event that the
amount in dispute is less than $1.0 million. In the event that a dispute is
to be settled by arbitration pursuant to the foregoing, either Parent or the
Shareholder Representative may demand arbitration of the matter. Judgment upon
any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction. Subject to the arbitration provisions of this Section 9.7, and
except as may be required under Washington Law with respect to those
provisions of Article I of this Agreement that are mandatorily governed by
Washington Law, each party agrees not to commence any legal proceedings
related hereto except in such courts. The arbitration provisions of this
Section 9.7 shall not apply to the Escrow Agent.

 

9.8 _Enforcement_. Each party hereto acknowledges that the other party will be
irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy at law for any
violation by any party of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, including the confidentiality obligations set forth in Section 5.2
hereof. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedies that
may be available upon the breach of any such covenants or agreements, each
party hereto shall have the right to seek injunctive relief to restrain a
breach or threatened breach of, or otherwise to seek specific performance of,
the other partys covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement. This
Section 9.8 shall not apply to the Escrow Agent.

9.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefor, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 

9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 

9.11 _USA Patriot Act Compliance_. To help the government fight the funding of
terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial
institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each
person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such as a business
entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity the Escrow Agent will ask
for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The
Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses,
identification and authorization documents from individuals 

 



105   claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation.
The parties each agree to provide all such information and documentation as to
themselves as requested by Escrow Agent to ensure compliance with federal
law.

9.12 _Conflicts; Continuing Representation_. The parties hereto and
the Shareholder Representative (the "Consenting Parties") acknowledge that at
all times relevant hereto up to the closing DLA Piper LLP (US) ("Company
Counsel") has represented only the Company. If subsequent to the Closing any
dispute were to arise relating in any manner to this Agreement or any other
agreement between the Shareholder Representative or any Indemnifying Party, on
the one hand, and Parent or the Company, on the other hand ("Disputes"),
Parent and Company hereby consent to Company Counsels representation of the
Shareholder Representative (and/or such Indemnifying Party) in the Disputes.
Parent acknowledges that Company Counsel has been and will be providing legal
advice to the Company in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and in such capacity will have obtained
confidential information of the Company (the "Company
Confidential Information"). The Company Confidential Information includes all
communications, whether written or electronic, including any communications
between Company Counsel, the directors, officers, shareholders, accounting
firm, and/or employees of the Company, and all files, attorney notes, drafts
or other documents directly relating to this Agreement which predate the
Closing (collectively, the "Company Counsel Work Product"). In any Dispute, to
the extent that any Company Confidential Information is in Company Counsels
possession at the Effective Time, such Company Confidential Information may be
used on behalf of the Shareholder Representative in connection with such
Dispute at the sole discretion of the Shareholder Representative. In any
Dispute, the Consenting Parties waive the right to present any Company Counsel
Work Product as evidence in any action arising out of such Dispute. The
Consenting Parties waive their right to access any Company Counsel Work
Product, except as reasonably necessary in connection with an action which is
not a Dispute. The Consenting Parties hereby consent to the disclosure and use
by Company Counsel for the benefit of the Indemnifying Parties and
the Shareholder Representative of any information (confidential or otherwise)
disclosed to it by the Company (including its directors, officers,
shareholders, accounting firm, and/or employees of the Company) prior to the
Effective Time.

  Schedule 1.6(a)(iii)

 

"Total CY12 Earnout Consideration" shall mean:

(a) if Final CY12 EBIT shall be equal to or less than $34.4 million, then
zero;

 

(b) if Final CY12 EBIT shall be greater than $34.4 million and equal to or
less than $41.3 million, then an amount obtained from the following formula:

$38.0 million * ((Final CY12 EBIT  $34.4 million)/$6.9 million)

 

(c) if Final CY12 EBIT shall be greater than $41.3 million and equal to or
less than $129.8 million, then an amount obtained from the following formula:

$38.0 million + ($172.0 million * ((Final CY12 EBIT  $41.3 million)/$88.5
million)

 

(d) if Final CY12 EBIT shall be greater than $129.8 million, then $210.0
million.

 

"Total CY13 Earnout Consideration" shall mean:

(a) if Final CY13 EBIT shall be equal to or less than $56.9 million, then
zero;

 

(b) if Final CY13 EBIT shall be greater than $56.9 million and equal to or
less than $68.2 million, then an amount obtained from the following formula:

$62.0 million * ((Final CY13 EBIT  $56.9 million)/$11.3 million)

 

(c) if Final CY13 EBIT shall be greater than $68.2 million and equal to or
less than $212.7 million, then an amount obtained from the following formula:

$62.0 million + ($278.0 million * ((Final CY13 EBIT  $68.2 million)/$144.5
million)

 

(d) if Final CY13 EBIT shall be greater than $212.7 million, then $340.0
million

 

In addition, if Final CY12 EBIT is less than $129.8 million, and Final CY13
EBIT is greater than $212.7 million (the amount by which Final CY13
EBIT exceeds $212.7 referred to as the "CY13 Overachievement"), then the
Total CY13 Earnout Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to the
difference obtained by subtracting (x) the Total CY12 Earnout Consideration
as calculated on the basis of the Final CY12 EBIT from (y) the amount the
Total CY12 Earnout Consideration would have been if the Final CY12 EBIT had
been equal to the Final CY12 EBIT plus the CY13 Overachievement. In addition, if Final CY13 EBIT is less than $212.7 million, but (a) Final
CY13 EBIT is greater than Final CY12 EBIT and (b) Final CY12 EBIT is greater
than $129.8 million (the amount by which Final CY12 EBIT exceeds $129.8
million referred to as the "CY12 Overachievement"), then the Total CY13
Earnout Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to the difference
obtained by subtracting (x) the Total CY13 Earnout Consideration as calculated
on the basis of the Final CY13 EBIT from (y) the amount the Total CY13 Earnout
Consideration would have been if the Final CY13 EBIT had been equal to the
Final CY13 EBIT plus the CY12 Overachievement.

For purposes of the foregoing definitions, "+" means plus, "" means minus,
"*" means multiplied by and "/" means divided by.
