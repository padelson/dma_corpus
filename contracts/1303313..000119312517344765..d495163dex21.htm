EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

 Section 3.1 _Effects of the Merger._

(a) _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Hammer, Sledge or Merger Sub or the
holders of any shares of Sledge common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the "
_Sledge Common Stock_ "):

 

(i) Each share of Sledge Common Stock, if any, then held by Sledge or any
Wholly Owned Sledge Subsidiary or held in Sledges treasury shall
automatically be retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be paid, nor shall any other payment or right inure or be made with respect
thereto in connection with or as a consequence of the Merger;

 

(ii) Each share of Sledge Common Stock, if any, then held by Hammer or any
Wholly Owned Hammer Subsidiary shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be paid, nor shall any other payment or right inure or be made with respect
thereto in connection with or as a consequence of the Merger;

 

(iii) Except as provided in _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ and _Section 3.1(a)(ii)_ and
subject to _Sections 3.1(b)_ and _3.1(d)_ , each share of Sledge Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
automatically cancelled and retired and converted into the right to receive
that number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Hammer (" _Hammer Common Stock_ ") equal
to the Exchange Ratio. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Exchange Ratio_ "
means 0.9150. As of the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate ("
_Certificate_ ") or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented shares of Sledge Common Stock shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto other than the right to receive (A) shares of Hammer
Common Stock to be issued in consideration therefore upon the surrender of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and (B) __ any cash, without interest,
to be paid in lieu of any fractional share interests of Hammer Common Stock
in accordance with _Section 3.1(d)_ (the " _Merger Consideration_ ");

 



14

    

(iv) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Entity;
and

(v) At the Effective Time, each share of Hammer Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding. Immediately following the Effective Time, shares of Hammer Common
Stock owned by Surviving Entity or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Surviving Entity shall be surrendered to Hammer without payment therefor. 

(b) _Adjustment of the Exchange Ratio_. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, if any of Sledge or Hammer should split, combine or
otherwise reclassify either the Sledge Common Stock or the Hammer Common Stock
or makes a dividend or other distribution in shares of the Sledge Common Stock
or the Hammer Common Stock (including any dividend or other distribution of
securities convertible into Sledge Common Stock or Hammer Common Stock), or
engages in a reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or other like
change, then (without limiting any other rights of the Parties hereunder), the
Exchange Ratio shall be ratably adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
such split, combination, reclassification, dividend, distribution,
reorganization, exchange or change, and thereafter all references to the
Exchange Ratio shall be deemed to be the Exchange Ratio as so adjusted.

(c) _Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the share transfer
books of Sledge shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Sledge Common Stock. From and after the Effective
Time, Persons who held Sledge Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares, except as
otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. On or after the
Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares of Sledge Common Stock
presented to the Exchange Agent, Hammer or the Surviving Entity shall be
exchanged for the Merger Consideration with respect to Sledge Common Stock
formerly represented thereby.

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates representing fractional shares of
Hammer Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares of Sledge Common Stock, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Hammer. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Sledge Common Stock converted pursuant to
the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Hammer Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares of Sledge Common Stock delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount rounded to the
nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying (i) the per share Nasdaq
Official Closing Price of the Hammer Common Stock (as reported on
www.nasdaq.com) on the date immediately preceding the date on which the
Effective Time shall occur (or, if the Hammer Common Stock did not trade on
the NASDAQ on such prior date, the last day of trading in Hammer Common Stock
on the NASDAQ prior to the Effective Time) by (ii) the fraction of a share of
Hammer Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.

Section 3.2 _Exchange Procedures; Exchange Agent; Distributions with Respect
to Unexchanged Shares._

(a) As soon as practicable prior to the Effective Time (but in no event later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the mailing date of the Joint Proxy
Statement), Hammer will designate a nationally recognized bank, trust company
or stockholder services company reasonably acceptable to Sledge to act as
exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of the
Merger Consideration, as provided in _Section 3.1(a)(iii)_ and _Section
3.1(d)_. Prior to the Effective Time, Hammer will enter into an exchange agent
agreement with the Exchange Agent, in a form reasonably acceptable to Sledge,
setting forth the procedures to be used in accomplishing the deliveries and
other actions contemplated by this _Section 3.2_.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Hammer shall deposit with the Exchange Agent
for the sole benefit of the holders of shares of Sledge Common Stock, Book-
Entry Shares representing shares of Hammer Common

 



15

    

 Stock to be issued pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(iii)_ in exchange for the
shares of Sledge Common Stock. After the Effective Time on the appropriate
payment date, if applicable, Hammer shall provide or shall cause to be
provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on
such shares of Hammer Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_. Hammer shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time
to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with _Section 3.1(d)_. Such shares of Hammer Common Stock, together
with any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to  _Section 3.1(d)_ and
dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_ ,
are referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". Hammer shall cause the
Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make delivery of, the
Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Hammer shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate representing
shares of Sledge Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") in customary form as prepared by Hammer and reasonably
acceptable to Sledge (which shall specify, among other things, that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates, shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of
Sledge Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) Upon surrender of a Certificate representing shares of Sledge Common Stock
to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and validly
executed Letter of Transmittal, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate representing
shares of Sledge Common Stock shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (i) the number of whole shares of Hammer Common Stock into which the
Sledge Common Stock represented by the surrendered Certificate shall have been
converted at the Effective Time, (ii) __ cash in lieu of any fractional
share interest of Hammer Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.1(d)_ and
(iii) certain dividends and distributions in accordance with _Section 3.2(e)_
, if any, after the Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent
shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each Certificate
representing shares of Sledge Common Stock shall be deemed, at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such
surrender, the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article 3_. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later
than two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Exchange Agent shall issue and
deliver to each holder of Book-Entry Shares that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of Sledge Common Stock (i) the number of
whole shares of Hammer Common Stock represented by Book-Entry Shares into
which the Sledge Common Stock represented by the Book-Entry Share shall have
been converted at the Effective Time, (ii) __ cash in lieu of any fractional
share interest of Hammer Common Stock in accordance with  _Section 3.1(d)_
and (iii) __ certain dividends and distributions in accordance with _Section
3.2(e)_ , without such holder being required to deliver a Certificate or any
letter of transmittal, "agents message" or other documents to the Exchange
Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.

(e) No dividends or other distributions declared or made prior to or after the
Effective Time with respect to Hammer Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to any holder entitled by reason of the
Merger to receive shares of Hammer Common Stock until, and no cash payment in
lieu of a fractional share interest of Hammer Common Stock shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ until, such holder shall have
surrendered its Certificates of Sledge Common Stock or exchanged such holders
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this  _Section 3.2_. Subject to applicable
Law, following surrender of any such Certificate or exchange of Book-Entry
Shares of Sledge Common Stock, such holder shall be paid, in each case,
without interest, (i) __ the amount of any dividends or other distributions
theretofore paid with respect to the shares

 



16

    

 of Hammer Common Stock represented by the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
of Sledge Common Stock surrendered or exchanged by such holder and having a
record date on or after the Effective Time and a payment date prior to such
surrender and (ii) __ at the appropriate payment date or as promptly as
practicable thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such shares of Hammer Common Stock and having a
record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date on or after such surrender.

(f) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Sledge Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of Sledge, it shall be a
condition of payment that any Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or
exchanged in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 3.2_
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or Book-Entry Share
exchanged, or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Hammer
that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of Sledge Common Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Hammer upon demand, and any former holders of Sledge Common
Stock prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this _Article
3_ shall thereafter look only to Hammer for payment of their claims with
respect thereto.

(h) None of Sledge, Hammer, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent, or
any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of such entities, shall
be liable to any Person in respect of the Merger Consideration if the Exchange
Fund (or the appropriate portion thereof) has been delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any shares of Sledge Common
Stock immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Hammer free and
clear of any claims or interest of such holders or their successors, assigns
or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

effect, except where the failure to be in possession of, or the failure to be

change the scope of rights under or fail to renew any Sledge Material
Contract.

Section 5.19 _Insurance_ _._ Sledge maintains insurance policies (including
policies providing casualty, liability, and workers compensation coverage) and
fidelity bonds or other insurance Contracts providing coverage for Sledge and
the Sledge Subsidiaries, except for any failure to maintain such coverage
as would not be material (the " _Sledge Insurance Policies_ "). Except as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Sledge Material Adverse Effect, all premiums due and payable under all Sledge
Insurance Policies have been paid, and Sledge and the Sledge Subsidiaries
have otherwise complied in all material respects with the terms and conditions
of all Sledge Insurance Policies. No written notice of cancellation or
termination has been received by Sledge or any Sledge Subsidiary with respect
to any such policy which has not been replaced on substantially similar terms
prior to the date of such cancellation. Except as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Sledge Material Adverse
Effect, each of Sledge and the other Sledge Subsidiaries is, and since January
1, 2014 has been, insured with respect to its assets and properties and the
conduct of its business in such amounts and against such risks as are in its
reasonable judgment sufficient for compliance with Law and as are adequate to
protect its assets and properties and the conduct of its business.

 

Section 5.20 _Related Party Transactions_ _._ Except as (i) set forth in 
_Section 5.20_ of the Sledge Disclosure Letter or (ii) __ described in the
publicly available Historic Sledge SEC Documents, no agreements, arrangements
or understandings between Sledge or any Sledge Subsidiary (or binding on

Person, on the other hand (other than those exclusively among Sledge and
Sledge Subsidiaries), are in existence that are not, but are required to be,
disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

Section 5.21 _Brokers._ No broker, investment banker or other Person (other
than the Persons listed in _Section 5.21_ of the Sledge Disclosure Letter) is
entitled to any brokers, finders or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Sledge or any Sledge
Subsidiary.

the opinion of Guggenheim Securities, LLC, to the effect that, as of the date
of such opinion and based on and subject to the assumptions,
limitations, qualifications, conditions and other matters set forth therein,
the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Sledge Common Stock (other than Hammer and its Affiliates). Sledge will
deliver to Hammer a complete and correct copy of such written opinion
promptly after the date hereof solely for informational purposes.

 

Section 5.23 _Takeover Statutes._ Assuming that neither Hammer nor Merger Sub
nor any of its "affiliates" or "associates" is, or at any time during the
last three (3) __ years has been, an "interested stockholder" of Sledge, in
each case as defined in Section __ 203 of the DGCL, the Sledge Board has
taken all action necessary to render the restrictions on "business
combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth in Section
__ 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Furthermore, neither Sledge nor any of its

Agreement, (i) Hammer and Sledge shall prepare and cause to be filed with the
SEC the Joint Proxy Statement in preliminary form with respect to the Hammer
Stockholders Meeting and the Sledge Stockholders Meeting and (ii) Hammer and
Sledge shall prepare, and Hammer shall cause to be filed with the SEC, a

Each of Hammer and Sledge shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) have
the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, (B) ensure that the Form S-4 complies in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the

shall furnish all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the
holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably requested by the other
Party and provide such other Party assistance as may be reasonably requested
by the other Party in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution
of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement and shall provide to their and
each others counsel such representations as reasonably necessary to render
the opinions required to be filed therewith. The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement shall include all information reasonably requested by such other
Party to be included therein. For the avoidance of doubt, no filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Hammer, and no filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by
Hammer or Sledge, in each case without providing the other Party with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Each Party shall
promptly notify the other Party of any comments it receives from the SEC or
any request it receives from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof, provide the other Party with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Form S-4
or the Joint Proxy Statement received from the SEC and advise the other Party
of any oral comments with respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement received from the SEC. Each of Hammer and Sledge shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments
from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or mailing the Joint Proxy

provide the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or
response)

 and shall give due consideration to all reasonable changes provided by the
other Party. Each of Hammer and Sledge shall notify the other Party, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form
S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the
qualification for offering or sale in any jurisdiction of the shares of Hammer

their reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension
lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Each of Hammer and Sledge shall also

reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

 

(b) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Hammer or Sledge, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered
by Hammer or Sledge which, in the reasonable judgment of Hammer or Sledge,
should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party, and Hammer and Sledge shall
cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or
supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement and, to the extent
required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to stockholders of Hammer and stockholders of Sledge. Nothing in
this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any Party under _Section
7.1(a)_. For purposes of _Section 4.25_, _Section 5.23_ and this _Section
7.1_, any information concerning or related to Hammer, its Affiliates or the
Hammer Stockholders Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by Hammer,
and any information concerning or related to Sledge, its Affiliates or the
Sledge Stockholders Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by Sledge.

been declared effective, Hammer shall, in accordance with applicable Law and
the Hammer Governing Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Hammer Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of

discretion); _provided_ , that such record date shall not be more than
sixty (60) days, and not less than ten (10) __ days, prior to the date of

reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the
other Parties and any of their respective subsidiaries that may result from

Each of Hammer and Sledge shall, and shall cause each of the Hammer
Subsidiaries and the Sledge Subsidiaries, respectively, and shall use

Party or shall be provided (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) to the
other Party prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it

Sledge Board shall (i) fail to make or shall withdraw (or modify or qualify in
any manner adverse to the other Party or publicly propose to withdraw, modify

Charter and the other transactions contemplated hereby, as applicable, (ii)
adopt, approve, or publicly recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable

Recommendation or the Sledge Board Recommendation, as applicable (each such
action set forth in this _Section 7.3(b)_ being referred to herein as an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ")

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Hammer Stockholder Approval or the Sledge Stockholder
Approval, as applicable, and following the compliance

 



63

    

 with this _Section 7.3(c)_ , the Hammer Board or the Sledge Board may, if
such Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel)

Change; provided, that prior to effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change,
(i) Hammer or Sledge, as applicable, shall notify the other Party in writing,
at least five (5) __ Business Days prior to effecting such Adverse
Recommendation Change (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to effect
such Adverse Recommendation Change (which notice shall specify in reasonable

Recommendation Change is based upon receipt of a Superior Proposal, shall
include the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the
identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal and include copies of the
current drafts of all material agreements between such Party and the party
making such Superior Proposal and any other material documents or agreements
that relate to such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that
such notice or the public disclosure by such Party of such notice shall not in
and of itself constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change)), (ii) during the
Notice Period, the Party providing such notice shall negotiate with the other
Party in good faith (to the extent such other Party wishes to negotiate) to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with such Partys Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, and (iii) the applicable Partys Board shall determine,
after the close of business on the last day of the Notice Period, in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and after giving effect to any
adjustments proposed by the other Party in writing during the Notice Period)
that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with such Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of any material
change to the material terms of such Superior Proposal, Hammer or Sledge,
as applicable, shall, in each case, have delivered to the other Party an
additional notice consistent with that described in clause (i) above and the
Notice Period shall have recommenced (in which case such Notice Period shall
be for three (3) __ Business Days instead of five (5) Business Days).

Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer to enter into or seeking to
have discussions or negotiations relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal.
Such notice to the other Party shall indicate the identity of the Person
making and include the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer (including a complete copy thereof if in
writing and any related documents or correspondence). Following the date
hereof, each Party shall keep the other Party reasonably informed orally and
in writing on a current basis (and in any event, no later than one (1)
Business Day) of any material developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal including providing a copy of all material
documentation (including drafts) or material correspondence with
respect thereto and upon the request of such other Party shall apprise the
other Party of the status and details of such Acquisition Proposal. Each Party
agrees that it and its subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any
Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits such Party from
providing any information to the other Party in accordance with, or from
otherwise complying with the terms of, this _Section 7.3_.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.3_ shall prohibit Hammer or the
Hammer Board, or Sledge or the Sledge Board, respectively, from (i) issuing a
"stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act or taking and disclosing a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a), 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange
Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of Hammer or Sledge,
as applicable, if, in the good faith judgment of such Board (after
consultation with outside counsel), failure to so disclose would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
and disclosure referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) shall not be deemed to be
an Adverse Recommendation Change so long as (A) any such disclosure includes
the Hammer Board Recommendation or the Sledge Board Recommendation, as
applicable, without any modification or qualification thereof or continues
the prior recommendation of the Hammer Board or the Sledge Board,
respectively, and (B) does not contain an express Adverse Recommendation
Change; _provided_ , that in no event shall this _Section 7.3(e)_ affect
either Partys obligations specified in _Section 7.3(b)_.

injunction, temporary restraining order or other Law in any suit or other
action, arbitration, or litigation, which could otherwise have the effect of

entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that could prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date
the Closing from occurring; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance
of doubt, such litigation shall in no way limit the obligations of the parties

case of any Action to enforce rights to indemnification or advancement of
expenses, that any Indemnified Party is successful, in whole or in part, in
enforcing such Indemnified Partys rights with respect to indemnification or
advancement of expenses) of any Indemnified Party without the requirement of
any bond or other security, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, but subject to Hammers or the Surviving Entitys receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such amount if
it shall ultimately be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Hammer or the Surviving
Entity, as applicable, (i) __ shall not settle or compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any
Action against or investigation of any Indemnified Party for which
indemnification may be sought under this _Section 7.7(a)_ without the

investigation, (ii) shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (iii) __ shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party to the extent that a court of competent

amount of all such expenses previously advanced pursuant hereto for which
indemnification is prohibited by such final and non-appealable Order.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of Hammer and the Surviving Entity
agrees that all rights to exculpation of liabilities, indemnification and
advancement of expenses existing as of the date hereof in favor of the current
and former managers, directors, officers, partners, members, trustees,
employees or agents of Sledge or any of the Sledge
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") for acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, as
provided in (i) the Sledge Governing Documents or, if applicable, similar
organizational documents or agreements of any Sledge Subsidiary and any of the
Hammer Governing Documents with respect to any of the Indemnified Parties or

obligations set forth in any Sledge Benefit Plan or (ii) __ any
indemnification agreements of Sledge or any Sledge Subsidiary, all of which
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

shall cause the Surviving Entity to maintain in effect Sledges current
directors and officers liability insurance covering each Person currently
covered by Sledges directors and officers liability insurance policy
for acts or omissions occurring prior to and through the Effective Time;
_provided_ , that in lieu of such obligation, (i) the Surviving Entity may
substitute therefor policies of an insurance company with the same or better
rating as Sledges current insurance carrier the material terms of which,
including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect
to such Indemnified Parties than Sledges existing policies as of the date
hereof or (ii) in consultation with Hammer, Sledge may obtain extended
reporting period coverage under Sledges existing insurance programs (to be
effective as of the Effective Time) for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time for a cost not in excess of three times the current annual
premiums for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event
shall the Surviving Entity be required to pay annual premiums for insurance
under this _Section 7.7(c)_ in excess of 300% of the most recent annual
premiums paid by Sledge for such purpose, it being understood that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Entity shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be
obtained for such 300% amount.

(d) Hammer shall cause the Surviving Entity to pay all reasonable expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses that may be incurred
by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the obligations provided in this
_Section 7.7_.

express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party (who
are intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.7_), his or her
heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Sledge, Hammer and the Surviving Entity and shall
not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Party (including
his or her successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (including such successors, assigns and heirs) affected

or otherwise.

Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action
necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Takeover Statute or any restrictions in the Hammer Charter or
the Sledge Charter (" _Charter Restrictions_ ") on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Party shall take any action
to exempt any Person (other than the other Parties or their respective
Affiliates) from any Takeover Statute of any jurisdiction or the Charter
Restrictions that may purport to be applicable to the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise cause any
restrictions in any Takeover Statute or the Charter Restrictions not to apply
to any such Person.

 

Section 7.11 _Tax Matters._

 

(a) Each Party shall deliver to each of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP and Alston

referred to herein and reporting consistently for all U.S. federal, state,
and local income Tax or other purposes.

(d) Neither Hammer nor Sledge shall take or omit to take any action, and
neither party shall allow any of their respective Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Entity, to take or omit to take any action, if such action

 



70

from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. Unless otherwise required by a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313 of the Code, neither Hammer nor Sledge shall take, and neither

legal, financial and accounting advisors) to, use reasonable best efforts (a)

right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, or to
loss of a material benefit under, such Contracts relating to
Indebtedness, (b) __ to refinance, renew or replace the Indebtedness under
such Contracts on terms mutually agreeable to Hammer and Sledge, _provided_

breach of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to any notification or consent requirement or any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, or to loss of a
material benefit under, any Contract under which such Indebtedness is
refinanced, renewed or replaced, or (c) __ to the extent that the waivers,
consents, amendments or approvals contemplated by clause (a) __ are not
obtained and such Indebtedness is not refinanced, renewed or replaced as
contemplated by clause (b), to ensure that sufficient cash is available for
the prompt payment in full of any Indebtedness under any such Contract and
termination of any such Contract, in each case at or prior to the Closing
Date. 

Section 7.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Hammer and
Sledge shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions

compensation no less favorable than those provided to each such employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) __ employee benefits and
bonus opportunities no less favorable in the aggregate than, in Hammers
discretion, either those provided immediately prior to the Effective Time or
those provided to similarly-situated employees of Hammer. Nothing contained
in this _Section 7.14_ shall obligate Hammer to continue the employment of
any employee of Sledge or of the Sledge Subsidiaries for any period of time
after the Effective Time, and this _Section 7.14_ shall not be construed to
limit the ability of Hammer to terminate the employment of any employee of
Sledge or of the Sledge Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, provided
any such termination shall be in accordance with applicable Law and any pre-
existing contractual relationship.

(b) Subject to their obligations under applicable Law, Hammer will, and will
cause the Hammer Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Entity and its
subsidiaries) to, give credit under each employee plans, programs and
arrangements to employees for all service prior to the Effective Time with
Sledge or any Sledge Subsidiary for all purposes for which such service was
taken into account or recognized by Sledge or any Sledge Subsidiary, but not
to the extent crediting such service would result in duplication of benefits.

permitted by the Hammer Benefit Plans, (i) (A) use its reasonable best
efforts to waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods

such employee and his or her eligible dependents under any New Plans, and (B)

any co-payments or deductibles and out of pocket limits paid during the plan
year in which participation under a New Plan (to the same extent that such
credit was given under the analogous Sledge Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time) commences in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any New Plans and (ii) __ recognize all service of
each such employee with Sledge and each Sledge Subsidiary for all
purposes, including eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accrual
(including, in order to calculate the amount of any paid time off and leave
balance, vacation and sick days, severance and similar benefits), under any
New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under
the analogous Sledge Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time, but not to the
extent crediting such service would result in duplication of benefits.

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_ _._ This
Agreement (including the Exhibits, Schedules, the Hammer Disclosure Letter and
the Sledge Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute
the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement and, (b) __ except for the provisions of _Section 7.7_
(which, from and after the Effective Time shall be for the benefit of the
Indemnified Parties) are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the
Parties hereto any rights or remedies.

 Section 10.6 _Extension; Waiver_ _._ At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the Parties may, to the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise
set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or (c) subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of those rights.

 

Section 10.7 _Governing Law; Venue_ _._

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to laws that may be applicable
under conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America, sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any dispute arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of
the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence
any dispute except in such courts, (ii) __ agrees that any claim in respect
of any such dispute may be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such federal
court, (iii) __ waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of any such dispute in any such court, and (iv) __ waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such dispute in any such court. Each of the parties agrees that
a final judgment in any such dispute shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 10.2_. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

Section 10.8 _Assignment_ _._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the
Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties. This Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 10.9 _Specific Performance_ _._ The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article 9_ , each Party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and each Party
hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which such Party is entitled at Law or in equity.

 



80

    

Section 10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_ _._ EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) __
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 10.10_.

 

Section 10.11 _Authorship_ _._ The Parties agree that the terms and language
of this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and
their respective Representatives and, as a result, there shall be no
presumption that any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against
any Party. Any controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be
decided without regard to events of authorship or negotiation.

AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF

 

LHC GROUP, INC.

A DELAWARE CORPORATION

ARTICLE I

The name of the corporation is LHC Group, Inc. (the "Corporation").

ARTICLE II

 

The address of the corporations registered office in the State of Delaware is
Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington,
County of New Castle, 19801. The name of its registered agent at such address
is The Corporation Trust Company.

ARTICLE III 

The nature of the business or purposes to be conducted or promoted is to
engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized
under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

ARTICLE IV

 

The Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated
common stock ("Common Stock") and preferred stock ("Preferred Stock"). The
number of shares of Common Stock authorized to be issued is sixty million
(60,000,000), par value $0.01 per share, and the number of shares of Preferred
Stock authorized to be issued is five million (5,000,000), par value $0.01
per share.

The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series,
without further stockholder approval. The Board of Directors is hereby
authorized, in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors
providing for the issue of any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock,
within the limitations and restrictions stated in this Certificate of
Incorporation, to fix the designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional, or other special rights, and qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, including, without limitation, the
authority to fix or alter the dividend rights, dividend rate, conversion
rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption (including sinking fund
provisions), the redemption price or prices, and the liquidation preferences
of any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, and the number of shares
constituting any such series and the designation thereof, or any of them, and
to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the
issue of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such
series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall be
so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status
that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the
number of shares of such series.

ARTICLE V

 

The following provisions are inserted for the management of the business and
the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation and for further definition,
limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of its
directors and stockholders:

 

A. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under
the direction of the Board of Directors. In addition to the powers and
authority expressly conferred upon them by statute or by this Certificate of
Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation, the directors are hereby
empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may
be exercised or done by the Corporation.

   

B. The directors of the Corporation need not be elected by written ballot
unless the Bylaws so provide.

C. Following the effective date of the Corporations
registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and prepared in connection with the Corporations initial public
offering (the "IPO Date"), any action required or permitted to be taken by the
stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or
special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by
any consent in writing by such stockholders.

 

ARTICLE VI

The number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed from time to time
by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of
the Whole Board. For purposes of this Certificate of Incorporation, the term
"Whole Board" shall mean the total number of authorized directors whether or
not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships.

Following the IPO Date, the Board of Directors shall be divided into three
classes: Class I, Class II and Class III. Such classes shall be as nearly
equal in number of directors as possible. Each director shall serve for a term
ending on the third annual meeting of stockholders following the annual
meeting of stockholders at which such director was elected; provided, however,
that the directors first elected to Class I shall serve for a term ending on
the Corporations first annual meeting of stockholders following the
effectiveness of this Article, the directors first elected to Class II shall
serve for a term ending on the Corporations second annual meeting of
stockholders following the effectiveness of this Article and the directors
first elected to Class III shall serve for a term ending on the Corporations
third annual meeting of stockholders following the effectiveness of this
Article. The foregoing notwithstanding, each director shall serve until such
directors successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or until such
directors prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or other
removal.

 

At each annual election, directors chosen to succeed those whose terms then
expire shall be of the same class as the directors they succeed unless, by
reason of any intervening changes in the authorized number of directors, the
Board of Directors shall designate one or more directorships whose term then
expires as directorships of another class in order more nearly to achieve
equality of number of directors among the classes.

Notwithstanding the rule that the three classes shall be as nearly equal in
number of directors as possible, in the event of any change in the authorized
number of directors, each director then continuing to serve as such shall
nevertheless continue as a director of the class of which such director is a
member until the expiration of such directors current term, or such
directors prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or other
removal. If any newly created directorship may, consistently with the rule
that the three classes shall be as nearly equal in number of directors as
possible, be allocated to more than one class, the Board of Directors shall
allocate it to that of the available class whose term of office is due to
expire at the earliest date following such allocation.

 

Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then
outstanding, any directors, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed
from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

ARTICLE VII

 

A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or 

 



2

    

 which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii)
under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any
transaction from which the director derived any improper personal benefit. If
the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended after approval by the
stockholders of this Article VIII to authorize corporate action further
eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to
the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law as so
amended.

 

Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VII by
the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or
protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of, or
increase the liability of any director of this Corporation with respect to any
acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to, such repeal or
modification. 

ARTICLE VIII

The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal any
or all of the Bylaws of the Corporation. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of
the Bylaws of the Corporation by the Board of Directors shall require the
approval of a majority of the Whole Board. The stockholders shall also have
power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided,
however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series
of stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Certificate of
Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and
two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-
outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class,
shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws of
the Corporation.

ARTICLE IX

 

In addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of
this Corporation required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation, the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of
the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a
single class, shall be required to amend or repeal the provisions of Article
I, Article II, Article III and Article IV of this Certificate of
Incorporation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser
vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or
series of the stock of this Corporation required by law or by this Certificate
of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six
and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then
outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class,
shall be required to amend or repeal any provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation not specified in the preceding sentence. 

ARTICLE X

The incorporator of the corporation is Peter C. November, II, whose mailing
address is Alston and Bird, LLP, 1201 West Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia
30309.

 

ARTICLE XI

The powers of the incorporator are to terminate upon the filing of this
Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware. The name and mailing address of the person who shall serve as the
initial director of the corporation until his successor is duly elected and
qualified is Keith G. Myers, LHC Group, Inc., 420 West Pinhook Rd., Suite A,
Lafayette, LA 70503.
