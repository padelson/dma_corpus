Parent or Purchaser, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, automatically be cancelled and be converted
into a right to receive the price per share actually paid in the Offer in cash
(the &#147;Merger Consideration&#148;). Each Company Common Share (if any) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by the
Company, Parent or Purchaser shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.2. Surrender and Exchange of Company Common Shares Certificates.
After the Effective Time, each holder of an outstanding certificate or
certificates theretofore representing Company Common Shares, except those to be
cancelled in accordance with the last sentence of Section&nbsp;2.1.1, shall
surrender such certificate or certificates to such bank or trust company
designated by Parent (the &#147;Paying Agent&#148;), duly endorsed in blank or otherwise
in proper form for transfer, and shall receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Company Common Share. Until so surrendered and
exchanged, each certificate theretofore representing outstanding Company Common
Shares shall be deemed to represent the right to receive for each Company
Common Share the Merger Consideration without interest thereon, upon surrender
of the certificate formerly representing such Company Common Shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.3. Withholding Rights. Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Shares such
amounts as Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law; provided, however, that, pursuant to the
exception provided under Section&nbsp;1445(b)(6) of the Code, none of Parent,
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall withhold any amount under
Section&nbsp;1445 of the Code. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Shares
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Purchaser or the Paying Agent. For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;Tax&#148; (and,
with correlative meaning, &#147;Taxes&#148;) means any federal, state, local or foreign
income, gross receipts, property, sales, use, license, excise, franchise,
employment, payroll, premium, withholding, alternative or added minimum, ad
valorem, transfer or excise tax, or any other tax, custom, duty, governmental
fee or other like assessment or charge of any kind
whatsoever, together with any interest or penalty or addition thereto,
whether disputed or not, imposed by any Governmental Entity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.4. Unclaimed Funds; Transfers. Promptly following the date which is
180&nbsp;days after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to the
Surviving Corporation all cash and other documents in its possession relating
to the transactions described in this Agreement, and the Paying Agent&#146;s duties
shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a certificate formerly
representing a Company Common Share may surrender such certificate to the
Surviving Corporation and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat
and similar laws) receive in consideration therefor the aggregate price
relating thereto pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1.1, without any interest or dividends
thereon. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any Company Common

were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, certificates formerly representing Company Common Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, they shall be
surrendered and cancelled in return for the payment of the aggregate price
relating thereto, as provided in Section&nbsp;2.1.1.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.5. Lost Certificates. If any certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the applicable Merger consideration
with respect thereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.6. Transfer Taxes. If payment of the Offer Price payable to a holder
of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger is to be made to a person other
than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the issuance to a person other than the registered holder
of the certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each share of Purchaser Common Stock outstanding on the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into and be one share of the common stock, no par value,
of the Surviving Corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3 <B>Dissenting Shares</B>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3.1. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each
outstanding Company Common Share that is held of record by a holder who has
properly exercised dissenters&#146; rights with respect thereto under Section
23-1-44 of the Indiana Business Corporation Law shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1.1, but the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive such payment of the
fair value of such Company Common Share from the Surviving Corporation as
shall be determined pursuant to Section&nbsp;23-1-44 of the Indiana Business
Corporation Law; provided, however, that if any such holder shall have failed
to perfect or shall withdraw or lose such holder&#146;s rights under Section&nbsp;23-1-44
of the Indiana Business Corporation Law, each such holders&#146; Company Common
Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1.1.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3.2. The Company shall give Parent (x)&nbsp;prompt notice of any written
demands for payment of the fair value of shares, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments delivered pursuant to Section&nbsp;23-1-44 of the Indiana
Business Corporation Law and (y)&nbsp;the opportunity jointly to participate with
the Company in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
payment under Section&nbsp;23-1-44 of the Indiana Business Corporation Law.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a claim with respect to which indemnification pursuant hereto is
intended to be sought is made against any person entitled to indemnification
against such claim hereunder, such indemnified person shall notify the
indemnifying party of the assertion thereof by the claimant or of any action
commenced against such indemnified person within a reasonable time after such
person shall have learned of such assertion or been served with the summons or
other first legal process or given information as to the nature and basis of
the claim. The indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any suit brought
to enforce any such claim and shall be entitled to use counsel selected by it,
at its own expense. The indemnified person shall be entitled to join in the
defense of any such claim with counsel of its own choice, at its own expense.
The indemnifying party shall not be entitled to settle any such claim, without
the prior written consent of the indemnified party, unless, as part of such
settlement, the indemnified party shall receive a general release with respect
to such claim from the claimant.

under the Shareholder Tender Agreement) immediately prior to the acceptance for
payment of Company Common Shares pursuant to the Offer represents at least a
majority of the Fully Diluted Number of Company Shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Fully Diluted Number of Company Shares&#148; means the sum of (i)&nbsp;the

stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the acceptance of Company
Common Shares pursuant to the Offer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &#147;Triggering Event&#148; shall be deemed to have occurred if (A)&nbsp;the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if applicable, any committee thereof) shall have
withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent its approval or
recommendation of the Offer or the Merger or the matters to be considered at
the Special Shareholders Meeting or failed to reconfirm its recommendation
within 15 business days after receiving a written request from Parent to do so,

resolved to take any of the foregoing actions; provided that (x)&nbsp;actions taken
by the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the proviso to
Section&nbsp;5.1.3(i) of the Agreement shall not be deemed to be a withdrawal or
modification of its approval or recommendation of the Offer or the Merger or

&#147;stop-look-and-listen&#148; communication of the nature contemplated in Rules
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act with respect to an unsolicited tender offer or

Exchange Act, the Board of Directors or the Company shall publicly confirm such
approval and recommendation and recommends against the acceptance of such
tender offer or exchange offer by the shareholders of the Company.

and regulations of the SEC, the payment for, any tendered Company Common
Shares, and may amend the Offer consistent with the terms of the Agreement or
terminate the Offer and not accept for payment any tendered Company Common
Shares, if:
