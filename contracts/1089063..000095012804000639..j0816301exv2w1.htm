AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is dated as of June 21, 2004, by and among GALYANS TRADING COMPANY, INC., an Indiana corporation (the "Company"), DICKS SPORTING GOODS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Parent"), and DIAMONDBACKS ACQUISITION INC., an Indiana corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Purchaser").   

RECITALS:    

 The Board of Directors of the Company has determined that each of the Offer and the Merger (each as defined below) is in the best interests of the Company and has approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger;   

 The Boards of Directors of each of Parent and Purchaser have approved the Offer and the Merger upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth and have approved and adopted this Agreement;   

 The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 50,000,000 shares of Common Stock, no par value per share (the "Company Common Shares"), of which 17,435,368 shares are issued and outstanding and no shares are held in the treasury of the Company and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, no par value per share (the "Company Preferred Stock"), of which no shares have been issued;   

 The authorized capital stock of Purchaser consists of 1,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share ("Purchaser Common Stock"), 100 of which shares are issued and outstanding and owned by Parent; and   

 Immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to Parents and Purchasers willingness to enter into this Agreement, Parent is simultaneously entering into a shareholder tender agreement substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A (the "Shareholder Tender Agreement") with certain holders of the Company Common Shares and/or  rights to acquire Company Common Shares, pursuant to which (i) such shareholders are, among other things, agreeing to tender, and not withdraw, all of such shareholders Company Common Shares in the Offer upon the terms and conditions specified therein, and (ii) such shareholders are agreeing to certain restrictive covenants.   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements, provisions and covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:   

1\. THE MERGER; SURVIVING CORPORATION; CLOSING    

 1.1 The Merger.   

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and Purchaser shall be, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), merged in accordance with the Indiana    ##### 

  

  

Business Corporation Law (hereinafter called the "Merger") into a single
corporation existing under the laws of the State of Indiana, whereby the
Company shall be the surviving corporation (the Company, in its capacity as
the surviving corporation, is sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving
Corporation"). The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section
23-1-40-6 of the Indiana Business Corporation Law.    

 1.2 Name of Surviving Corporation.   

 The name of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time shall be "Galyans Trading Company, Inc."   

 1.3 Articles of Incorporation.   

 The Articles of Incorporation of Purchaser as in effect on the date hereof shall from and after the Effective Time be and continue to be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until changed or amended as provided by law.   

 1.4 Bylaws; Directors and Officers.   

 Without any further action by the Company and Purchaser, the Bylaws of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall from and after the Effective Time be and continue to be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended as provided therein. The directors of Purchaser and the officers of Purchaser at the Effective Time shall, from and after the effectiveness of the Merger, be the initial directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until in each case their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.   

 1.5 The Companys Shareholders Meeting.   

 Unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 23-1-40-4 of the Indiana Business Corporation Law as contemplated by Section 1.6 below, the Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall duly call a special meeting of its shareholders (the "Special Shareholders Meeting") to be held in accordance with the Indiana Business Corporation Law at the earliest practicable date, upon due notice thereof to its shareholders, to consider and vote upon, among other matters, the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger. Subject to Section 5.1.3 below, the Companys Board of Directors will recommend the approval of the Merger and will use its reasonable best efforts, consistent with its fiduciary duties and assuming the recommendation of the approval of the Merger has not been withdrawn, to solicit the requisite vote of the Companys shareholders to approve this Agreement and the Merger pursuant to proxy solicitation materials. Each of Parent and Purchaser agrees that it will execute a written consent or vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Company Common Shares acquired by it pursuant to the Offer and otherwise then owned by it and its subsidiaries in favor of the approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement. In addition, each of Parent and Purchaser agrees that from (and including) the date on which Parent or any of its subsidiaries purchases at least a majority of the issued and outstanding Company Common Shares (the "Share Purchase Date") through the Effective Time, it will not sell, transfer, assign, pledge,    ##### 

  

  

exchange or otherwise dispose of the Company Common Shares (including
those purchased in the Offer) or rights therein (whether acquired pursuant to
the Offer or otherwise).    

 1.6 Merger Without Meeting of Shareholders.   

 If Purchaser shall own at least 90 percent of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective, as soon as practicable after the consummation of the Offer, without a meeting of shareholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 23-1-40-4 of the Indiana Business Corporation Law.   

 1.7 Effective Time.   

 Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger in accordance with Section 23-1-40-5 of the Indiana Business Corporation Law on the Closing Date (as defined below). The Merger shall become effective immediately upon such filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Indiana, which date and time is herein referred to as the "Effective Time."   

 1.8 Closing.   

 The closing on the Merger (the "Closing") shall occur at the offices of Buchanan Ingersoll PC, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Closing shall occur at a time and date (the "Closing Date") to be specified by Parent, which shall be no later than the third business day following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6, unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.   

 1.9 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.   

 The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.   

2\. STATUS AND CONVERSION OF SECURITIES    

 The manner and basis of converting the shares of the capital stock of the Company and Purchaser (and rights to acquire common stock) and the amount of consideration which the holders of the Company Common Shares (or holders of options or warrants to acquire company common shares) are to receive in exchange for such securities are as follows:   

 2.1 Company Capital Stock.   

 2.1.1. Conversion of Company Common Shares Into Cash. On the Effective Time, each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective    ##### 

  

  

Time, other than Company Common Shares (if any) owned by the Company, Parent
or Purchaser, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, automatically be cancelled and be converted into
a right to receive the price per share actually paid in the Offer in
cash (the "Merger Consideration"). Each Company Common Share (if any) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by
the Company, Parent or Purchaser shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor.    

 2.1.2. Surrender and Exchange of Company Common Shares Certificates. After the Effective Time, each holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates theretofore representing Company Common Shares, except those to be cancelled in accordance with the last sentence of Section 2.1.1, shall surrender such certificate or certificates to such bank or trust company designated by Parent (the "Paying Agent"), duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in proper form for transfer, and shall receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Company Common Share. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each certificate theretofore representing outstanding Company Common Shares shall be deemed to represent the right to receive for each Company Common Share the Merger Consideration without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing such Company Common Shares.   

 2.1.3. Withholding Rights. Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Shares such amounts as Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law; provided, however, that, pursuant to the exception provided under Section 1445(b)(6) of the Code, none of Parent, Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall withhold any amount under Section 1445 of the Code. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Purchaser or the Paying Agent. For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax" (and, with correlative meaning, "Taxes") means any federal, state, local or foreign income, gross receipts, property, sales, use, license, excise, franchise, employment, payroll, premium, withholding, alternative or added minimum, ad valorem, transfer or excise tax, or any other tax, custom, duty, governmental fee or other like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever, together with any interest or penalty or addition thereto, whether disputed or not, imposed by any Governmental Entity.   

 2.1.4. Unclaimed Funds; Transfers. Promptly following the date which is 180 days after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation all cash and other documents in its possession relating to the transactions described in this Agreement, and the Paying Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a certificate formerly representing a Company Common Share may surrender such certificate to the Surviving Corporation and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) receive in consideration therefor the aggregate price relating thereto pursuant to Section 2.1.1, without any interest or dividends thereon. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any Company Common    ##### 

  

    

Share which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, certificates formerly representing Company Common
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, they
shall be surrendered and cancelled in return for the payment of the aggregate
price relating thereto, as provided in Section 2.1.1.   

 2.1.5. Lost Certificates. If any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the applicable Merger consideration with respect thereto.   

 2.1.6. Transfer Taxes. If payment of the Offer Price payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.   

 2.2 Purchaser Common Stock.   

 Each share of Purchaser Common Stock outstanding on the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and be one share of the common stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation.   

 2.3 Dissenting Shares.   

 2.3.1. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each outstanding Company Common Share that is held of record by a holder who has properly exercised dissenters rights with respect thereto under Section 23-1-44 of the Indiana Business Corporation Law shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1.1, but the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive such payment of the fair value of such Company Common Share from the Surviving Corporation as shall be determined pursuant to Section 23-1-44 of the Indiana Business Corporation Law; provided, however, that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall withdraw or lose such holders rights under Section 23-1-44 of the Indiana Business Corporation Law, each such holders Company Common Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, pursuant to Section 2.1.1.   

 2.3.2. The Company shall give Parent (x) prompt notice of any written demands for payment of the fair value of shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments delivered pursuant to Section 23-1-44 of the Indiana Business Corporation Law and (y) the opportunity jointly to participate with the Company in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for payment under Section 23-1-44 of the Indiana Business Corporation Law.    ##### 

  

  

The Company will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands delivered to the Company pursuant to Section 23-1-44 of the Indiana
Business Corporation Law and will not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, settle or offer to settle any such demands or waive any failure to
comply with Section 23-1-44 of the Indiana Business Corporation Law by any
holder of Company Common Shares.    

 2.4 Company Stock Options and Other Stock Plans and Warrants.   

 2.4.1. Each warrant or other right to acquire Company Common Shares, and each option granted under the Companys 1999 Stock Option Plan or under any other plan or agreement of the Company that is outstanding and unexpired immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, with respect to which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share shall, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled in exchange for a single lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such warrant or option and (2) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such option or warrant (subject to any applicable withholding taxes). Each warrant to acquire Company Common Shares, and each option granted under the Companys 1999 Stock Option Plan or under any other plan or agreement of the Company that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exerciseable, with respect to which the Merger Consideration does not exceed the exercise price per share shall, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled and no payments shall be made with respect thereto.   

 2.4.2. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Companys Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee administering Company stock plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as are required to give effect to this Section 2.4 as it relates to options granted under the Companys 1999 Stock Option Plan, as amended. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes or proof of eligibility of exemption therefrom and shall be paid without interest by the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Effective Time. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents of the holders of Company stock options as shall be necessary, if any, to effectuate the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, payment shall, at Parents request, be withheld in respect of any Company stock option until all necessary consents with respect to such Company stock option are obtained.   

 2.4.3. The Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP") shall be treated in accordance with its provisions (including Sections 5.4(c) and 10.5 thereof). As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Companys Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company ESPP) shall take all action necessary to set the Purchase Date (as defined in the Company ESPP) for the Calendar Half (as defined in the Company ESPP) now in progress, which Purchase Date shall be the earlier to occur of June 30, 2004 and the business day which immediately precedes the Effective Time (the "New Purchase Date"). The Company shall give any required notice to participants in the Company ESPP and the accumulated payroll deductions credited to each participants account through the New Purchase Date shall be used to acquire Company Common Shares under the ESPP. From and after the New Purchase Date, no new payroll contributions shall be accepted    ##### 

  

  

by, or made to, the Company ESPP. The Company agrees that, from the date of
this Agreement through the New Purchase Date, the Company ESPP shall
be operated only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with
the previous operation of the Company ESPP.    

 2.4.4. All of the Companys stock option plans and agreements (including any warrants) and the Company ESPP shall terminate as of the Effective Time, and the provisions in any other the Company Benefit Plan providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company shall be deleted as of the Effective Time, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause, following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company stock option or any participant in any Company stock plan, the Company ESPP or other Company benefit plan to have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company or the Surviving Corporation.   

3\. THE OFFER    

 3.1 The Offer to Purchase.   

 3.1.1. The Offer to Purchase. Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article 7 and the Company shall have filed, or shall be prepared to file upon commencement of the Offer (as defined below), the Schedule 14D-9 (as defined below) as contemplated by Section 3.3 below, Purchaser shall as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than six business days following the public announcement of the terms of this Agreement) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") an offer (the "Offer") to purchase for cash all of the outstanding Company Common Shares at a price per share equal to $16.75 (such price, or any other price per share as may be paid in the Offer, the "Offer Price"), net to the seller in cash, subject to the conditions set forth in Exhibit B hereto. Purchaser shall, on the terms and subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Offer, accept for payment and pay for Company Common Shares tendered as soon as practicable after the later of the satisfaction of the conditions to the Offer and the expiration of the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to commence the Offer and to accept for payment and to pay for any Company Common Shares validly tendered shall be subject only to the conditions set forth in Exhibit B hereto. The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") containing the terms set forth in this Agreement and the conditions set forth in Exhibit B hereto. Unless extended in accordance with Section 3.1.2 and/or Section 3.1.3 below, the Offer shall expire 20 business days after the date of its commencement (such date, as may be extended in accordance with Section 3.1.2 and/or Section 3.1.3 below, the "Expiration Date").   

 3.1.2. Purchaser reserves the right to modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) decrease the aggregate number of Company Common Shares sought, (iii) change the form of consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer, (iv) modify any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Exhibit B hereto, (v) impose conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Exhibit B hereto, (vi) except as provided in the proviso set forth below in this paragraph, extend the Offer, or (vii) amend any other term or condition of the Offer in any manner which is adverse to the holders of Company Common Shares, it being agreed that a waiver by Purchaser of any condition in its discretion shall not be deemed to be adverse to the holders of Company Common    ##### 

  

  

Shares; provided that, if on any scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as
it may be extended in accordance with the terms hereof), all conditions
to the Offer shall not have been satisfied or waived, Purchaser may, without
the consent of the Company, but shall, at the request of the Company, (x)
from time to time, extend the Offer in increments of not more than ten
business days each if any of the conditions set forth in clauses (i),
(ii)(a), (d) and (e) of the conditions set forth in Exhibit B hereto have not
been satisfied or waived, until such time as the conditions are satisfied or
waived and (y) extend the Offer for any period required by any regulation,
interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; provided, however, that
the Expiration Date may not be so extended beyond December 31, 2004.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on any scheduled expiration date of the
Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with the terms hereof), all
conditions to the Offer shall not have been  satisfied or waived, Purchaser
may, without the consent of the Company, from time to time, extend the Offer
in increments of not more than ten business days each if any of the
conditions set forth in clauses (ii)(b), (c) and (g) of the conditions set
forth in Exhibit B hereto have not been satisfied or waived, until such time
as the conditions are satisfied or waived provided, however, that the
Expiration Date may not be so extended beyond December 31, 2004.    

 3.1.3. If, on the Expiration Date, the Minimum Condition has been satisfied or, with the consent of the Company, waived, and all other conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or waived but less than 90% of the Company Common Shares then issued and outstanding on a Fully-Diluted Basis, together with Company Common Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser and their subsidiaries, have been validly tendered and not withdrawn, Purchaser may extend the Offer for a further period of time, after it has accepted and paid for (in accordance with the first sentence of this Section) all of the Company Common Shares tendered in the initial offer period, by means of a subsequent offering period (a "Subsequent Offering Period") of at least 3 but no more than 20 business days in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act to meet the objective (which is not a condition to the Offer) that there be tendered prior to the Expiration Date (as so extended) and not withdrawn a number of Company Common Shares which, together with Company Common Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser and their subsidiaries, represents at least 90% of the then issued and outstanding Company Common Shares on a Fully-Diluted Basis.

 (ii) Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other agents to, cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any possible Takeover Proposal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Board of Directors determines in good faith by a majority vote, based on the advice of its outside legal counsel, that there is a reasonable basis for its determination that such action is required for it to comply with its fiduciary duties with respect to a Favorable Third Party Proposal, then the Board of Directors of the Company may (1) withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the Merger or the adoption and approval of the matters to be considered at the Special Shareholders Meeting, (2) approve or recommend the Favorable Third Party Proposal and/or (3) after the third business day following the Companys written notice to Parent that specifies the material terms and conditions of the Favorable Third Party Proposal, terminate this Agreement (and concurrently with such termination, if it so chooses, cause the Company to enter into any Acquisition Agreement with respect to the Favorable Third Party Proposal).

As used in this Agreement, "Favorable Third Party Proposal" means a written proposal from a    ##### 

  

 

credible third party relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of 50% or more of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or 50% or more of any class or series of equity securities
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 50% or
more of the combined voting power of Company Common Shares, or any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its subsidiaries in which the other party thereto or its shareholders will
own 50% or more of the combined voting power of the parent entity resulting
from any such transaction, and otherwise on terms which the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment (based on the
advice of the Company Financial Advisor or another financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and considering any modifications to this
Agreement proposed by Parent), taking into account legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal deemed appropriate by the Board
of Directors of the Company, to be at a higher price or financial value per
Company Common Share, than the Merger (taking into account any amendments to
this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to the receipt by Parent of the
proposal) to the Companys shareholders.

 (ii) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, at its election, either (A) cause the Surviving Corporation to use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in effect, if available, directors and officers liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms no less favorable to those currently applicable to the directors and officers of the Company or (B) obtain, or permit the Company to obtain, a six year "tail" insurance policy that provides coverage no less favorable than the coverage currently provided under the Companys directors and officers liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms no less favorable to those applicable to the directors and officers of the Company.

 5.2.2. Employee Benefit Plans.   

 (i) For a period of one year after the Closing, Parent shall either (A) cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to sponsor and maintain the Company Benefit Plans, or (B) provide benefits to the employees of the Company who continue to be employed by the Surviving Corporation (the "Company Employees") and their eligible dependents under employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements that in the aggregate are no less favorable than those benefits provided to the Company Employees and their eligible dependents by the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date.

Company Employees or their eligible dependents under a group health plan that
is not a Company Benefit Plan that was in effect on the Closing Date, Parent
shall (x) waive any pre-existing condition exclusion under such group health
plan to the extent coverage existed for such condition under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan covering such Company Employee or eligible
dependent on the Closing Date and (y) credit each Company Employee
and eligible dependent with all deductible payments and co-payments paid by
such Company Employee or eligible dependent during the current plan year
under any Company health plan covering such Company Employee or eligible
dependent prior to the Closing Date for purposes of determining the extent to
which any such Company Employee or eligible dependent has satisfied his or
her deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum
under any health plan for such plan year.    

 (ii) For a period of one year after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Company to maintain any severance pay plan, policy or agreement of the Company in effect as of the Closing Date on terms no less favorable to any person employed by the Company on the Closing Date than the terms of such plan on the date of this Agreement.

 (iii) After the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all obligations under all of the employment, severance, consulting and similar agreements of the Company existing on the date hereof.

In addition, the Company and Parent hereby amend the Confidentiality Agreement by replacing (i) the reference in fifth line of Section 8 (the non-solicitation provision) thereof from "one year" to "two years" and (ii) the reference in fifth line of in Section 5 (the no-hire provision) thereof from "one year" to "two years;" provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or otherwise, Section 8 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall not act in any way or manner to prohibit or limit the Parent or its affiliates from responding to any Takeover Proposal or from making an offer to the Board of Directors to improve the terms and conditions of the Offer and/or this Agreement in response to the Companys provision of notice of approval or recommendation of a Favorable Third Party Proposal and provided, further, however, that Section 5 (the no-hire provision) shall terminate and be of no force and effect if the Company    #####

Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(viii) and a third
party acquires a majority of the Companys equity or its a majority of the
assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, except as expressly
set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, as amended or modified hereby,
each provision of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive and continue to
be binding on the parties thereto in accordance with the terms thereof until
June 27, 2005.

EXHIBIT B    

CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER    

 Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") of which this Exhibit B is a part. For purposes of this Exhibit B:   

 "Minimum Condition" means that there shall be validly tendered and not withdrawn a number of Company Common Shares that (including the shares tendered under the Shareholder Tender Agreement) immediately prior to the acceptance for payment of Company Common Shares pursuant to the Offer represents at least a majority of the Fully Diluted Number of Company Shares.   

 "Fully Diluted Number of Company Shares" means the sum of (i) the aggregate number of Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the acceptance of Company Common Shares pursuant to the Offer, plus (ii) the aggregate number of Company Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of any option, warrant, other right to acquire capital stock of the Company or other security exercisable or convertible for Company Common Shares or other capital stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the acceptance of Company Common Shares pursuant to the Offer.   

 A "Triggering Event" shall be deemed to have occurred if (A) the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if applicable, any committee thereof) shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent its approval or recommendation of the Offer or the Merger or the matters to be considered at the Special Shareholders Meeting or failed to reconfirm its recommendation within 15 business days after receiving a written request from Parent to do so, or approved or recommended any Takeover Proposal in respect of the Company or (B) the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have resolved to take any of the foregoing actions; provided that (x) actions taken by the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the proviso to Section 5.1.3(i) of the Agreement shall not be deemed to be a withdrawal or modification of its approval or recommendation of the Offer or the Merger or the matters to be considered at the Special Shareholders Meeting and (y) a "stop-look-and-listen" communication of the nature contemplated in Rules 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act with respect to an unsolicited tender offer or exchange offer, without more, shall not be deemed to be any such withdrawal or modification if, within the period contemplated by Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, the Board of Directors or the Company shall publicly confirm such approval and recommendation and recommends against the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the shareholders of the Company.   

 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or return tendered Company Common Shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, the payment for, any tendered Company Common Shares, and may amend the Offer consistent with the terms of the Agreement or terminate the Offer and not accept for payment any tendered Company Common Shares, if:    ##### 

  

  

 (i) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied at the time of expiration of the Offer, as it may be extended; or   

 (ii) on any scheduled expiration date as the same may be extended of the Offer any of the following events or circumstances shall occur or exist or shall be reasonably determined by Parent or Purchaser to have occurred or exist:   

 (a) any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer and the Merger under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated;   

 (b) (A) with the exception of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.1.15, any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in Section 4.1 of the Agreement (which representations and warranties for purposes of this paragraph (ii)(b)(A) shall be read as though none of them contained any qualifiers such as "Material Adverse Effect," "Aggregate MAE," "in all material respects" or other materiality qualifiers) shall not have been true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of then scheduled expiration date of the Offer with the same force and effect as though made as of the then scheduled expiration date of the Offer (or as of the date when made in the case of any representation and warranty which specifically relates to the date of this Agreement or an earlier date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties in the aggregate, to be true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (B) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 4.1.15 of the Agreement (which representations and warranties for purposes of this paragraph (ii)(b)(B) shall be read as written, including with any qualifiers such as "Material Adverse Effect," "Aggregate MAE," "in all material respects" or other materiality qualifiers) shall not have been true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and the then scheduled expiration date of the Offer (or as of the date when made in the case of any representation and warranty which specifically relates to the date of this Agreement or an earlier date); provided, that any failure of any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in Section 4.1 of the Agreement, including those set forth in Section 4.1.15, to be true and correct cannot be, or has not been, cured in all material respects within 30 days after the giving of written notice to the Company of such failure;   

 (c) the Company shall have breached or failed in any material respect to perform and comply with any of its material obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Agreement and required to be performed or complied with by it;   

 (d) any Governmental Entity shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Order which is in effect and which (i) enjoins, restrains or prohibits consummation of the Offer or the Merger, (ii) enjoins, restrains or prohibits the ownership or operation by the Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries of all or any material portion of the business or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or as a result of the Offer or the Merger requires the Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of their respective business assets, (iii) enjoins, restrains or prohibits Parent or any subsidiary of Parent from exercising effectively full rights of ownership of any Company Common Shares, including the right to vote any shares acquired by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer on all matters properly presented to the Companys shareholders including the approval and adoption of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated    ##### 

  

 

thereby, (iv) requires divestiture by Parent or any affiliate of Parent
of any Company Common Shares; provided however, that notwithstanding the
forgoing, Purchaser may not invoke any condition in clauses (i), (ii), (iii)
and (iv) above if (A) Purchaser shall have failed in any material respect to
use its reasonable best efforts to oppose, contest, resolve, appeal, defend
against or lift, as applicable, such Order, (B) compliance with such Order
would not reasonably be expected to have an Aggregate MAE or (C) violation of
such Order would expose Parent or Purchaser to a maximum monetary fine or
penalty which is less than $15,000,000.00 and would not in the reasonable
judgment of Parent or Purchaser (i) expose Parent or Purchaser or any
officer, director, agent or attorney of Parent or Purchaser to violating any
criminal law or to any criminal sanction (ii) expose any officer, director,
agent or attorney of Parent or Purchaser to any contempt proceeding which
could result in a fine or imprisonment (iii) constitute a matter which an
officer or director would have to disclose in a proxy statement or Annual
Report on Form 10-K under Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K or (iv) constitute a
