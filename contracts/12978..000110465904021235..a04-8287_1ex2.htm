bound by the Allocation for purposes of determining any Taxes, (ii) prepare
and file, and cause their affiliates to prepare and file, their Tax Returns
on a basis consistent with the Allocation, and (iii) take no position, and
cause their affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with the Allocation
on any applicable Tax Return or in any proceeding before any Taxing Authority

4.1.2 The balance of the Timberlands Purchase Price shall be payable in one
or more promissory notes (the "Timber Notes") issued by Timber LLC to each of
Parent and Southern in an amount for Parent equal to the Parent Timberlands
Purchase Price less the portion thereof paid to Parent in cash pursuant
to Section 4.1.1, and an amount for Southern equal to the
Southern Timberlands Purchase Price less the portion thereof paid to Southern
in cash pursuant to Section 4.1.1, and which shall be in form and
substance mutually satisfactory to Parent and Holdings and substantially
consistent with the LC Commitment Letters (as defined below).  Each Timber
Note shall be secured by a standby letter of credit issued by a Credit
Enhancement Bank in an amount not less than the aggregate principal amount of
such Timber Note and for a term which exceeds the maturity of such Timber
Note by at least 95 days. The standby letter of credit and related
documentation shall be fully assignable in connection with any transfer,
sale, assignment or pledge of the Timber Notes and shall otherwise be
substantially consistent with the structure and terms described in the
commitment letters attached hereto as Schedule 4.1(b)

  



  

21      
   



  

(the "LC Commitment Letters") and reasonably acceptable in form and substance
to Parent. The interest rate on the Timber Notes shall be a fixed stated rate
of interest set forth in the Timber Notes, which shall, as described in the
Section entitled "Timber Installment Notes" in Exhibit A to the LC Commitment
Letters, be equal to (x) the interest rate for the "Collateral Notes"
described in the Section entitled "Collateral Notes" in Exhibit A to the LC
Commitment Letters, less (y) the sum of the cost of the letter of credit and
an additional percentage rate intended to cover the cost of administering the
Timber Notes during their term; provided that, at Holdings option, the
Timber Notes may provide for the payment of such interest rate without
reduction for the costs of the letter of credit, and in such case Parent
shall agree in writing with the Credit Enhancement Bank that it will upon
receipt of each such interest payment pay the Credit Enhancement
Bank directly the costs of the letter of credit.

  



  

4.1.3 Any reduction in the Timberlands Purchase Price pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement (including Section 9.3.2.1 or 10.2.1.2 or Article
13) shall operate to reduce the cash portion of the Timberlands Purchase
Price prior to any reduction in the aggregate amount of Timber Notes. Any
such reduction shall be allocated between Parent and Southern in proportion
to the relative amounts of the Parent Timberlands Purchase Price and the
Southern Timberlands Purchase Price prior to such reduction.

  



  

4.2 _Non-Timber Purchase Price_. The Non-Timber Purchase Price shall be paid
in cash to Parent, as agent for Sellers, at Closing by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account designated by Parent. Such
payment shall be made on the basis of Parents good faith estimate of the
Non-Timber Purchase Price (the "Estimated Non-Timber Purchase Price"). Such
estimate shall be made by Parent, and communicated to Holdings not less than
10 business days prior to Closing. Parent shall estimate the closing payment
on the basis of the latest financial data reasonably available (which shall
not be more than 60 days old). Such calculation shall include an estimate of
all adjustments to the Non-Timber Purchase Price required by this Agreement.
During and after its preparation of the Estimated  Non-Timber Purchase
Price, Parent shall give Holdings and its representatives reasonable access
to the information required to calculate, and otherwise being used to
calculate, and the personnel (including outside accountants) involved in
calculating, the Estimated Non-Timber Purchase Price. If Holdings disagrees
with Parents calculation of the Estimated Non-Timber Purchase Price, the
parties will use reasonable best efforts to resolve their respective
differences with regard to the calculation of the Estimated Non-Timber
Purchase Price, but if they cannot resolve their differences prior to Closing
despite such reasonable best efforts, then the Estimated Non-Timber Purchase
Price actually paid at the Closing shall be Parents determination thereof.

  



  

4.2.1 Within 60 days following the Closing, Holdings shall, at its expense
and with reasonable cooperation from Sellers employees, prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and deliver to Parent a consolidatedbalance sheet for the
Operating Units as of immediately prior to (but assuming consummation of) the
Closing (the "Closing Balance Sheet").  The Closing Balance Sheet shall be
prepared from the books and records of the Business in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and as set forth on Schedule D-3. The Closing Balance
Sheet shall be accompanied by a statement derived from the Closing Balance
Sheet (the "Closing Statement") setting forth Holdings calculation
of Closing Net Working Capital and the Non-Timber Purchase Price in
accordance with the terms hereof.

  



  

22      
   



  

4.2.2 Parent and its accountants shall have 30 days after delivery by
Holdings of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement to review
such financial statements. During such 30-day period, Parent and its
representatives shall have full access to all information used by Holdings,
and all personnel (including outside accountants) involved, in preparing the
Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and in calculating the Closing
Net Working Capital and the Non-Timber Purchase Price, including work papers
of Holdings accountants (subject to Sellers executing any waivers or
indemnifications reasonably required by Holdings accountants related
to review of such work papers). If, as a result of such review, Parent
determines that the Closing Balance Sheet, or Closing Net Working Capital or
the Non-Timber Purchase Price, was not prepared in accordance with the
requirements of this Agreement, it shall, prior to the expiration of such 30
day period, provide Holdings with a written statement of its objections (an
"Objection Statement"), setting forth a specific description of the basis of
each objection and the adjustments to the Closing Balance Sheet or the
calculations of Closing Net Working Capital or the Non-Timber Purchase Price
which Parent seeks to have made. Holdings shall then have 30 days to review
and respond to the Objection Statement. In reviewing any Objection
Statement, Holdings and its accountants shall have full access to all
information used by the Sellers, and all personnel (including outside
accountants) involved, in preparing the Objection Statement, including work
papers of Sellers accountants (subject to Holdings executing any necessary
waivers or indemnifications reasonably required by Sellers accountants
related to review of such work papers).

  



  

4.2.3 The parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement with
respect to all disputed items set forth in Parents Objection Statement. All
discussions in connection with such attempts shall be governed by Rule 408 of
the Federal Rules of Evidence or any similar state or local rule of evidence
that may be applicable to any settlement discussions, and all settlement
discussions shall be inadmissible in any proceeding before or submission to
the Independent Accountants resulting pursuant to this Section 4.2. If the
parties are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with respect to any
of such items within 45 days following the delivery of the
Objection Statement, they shall refer their remaining differences to the
Boise office of Deloitte and Touche LLP (the "Independent Accountants"), who
shall, acting as experts and not as arbitrators, determine in accordance with
this Agreement a resolution of the items referred to them. The parties shall
each direct the Independent Accountants to use their best efforts to render
their determination within 30 days after such submission. The Independent
Accountants determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
with respect to the items referred and shall not be subject to appeal except
for manifest error. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accountants
shall be borne equally by Parent and Holdings. The parties shall make readily
available to the Independent Accountants all relevant books and records of
the Business and any work papers generated by the parties (or their
accountants) in their preparation and review of the Closing Balance Sheet,
the Closing Statement and the Objection Statement together with any other
items reasonably requested by the Independent Accountants.

  



  

4.2.4 In the event that no Objection Statement is delivered to Holdings
during the 30 day period provided for in Section 4.2.2 or upon resolution of
all issues raised by such Objection Statement pursuant to the procedures
of Section 4.2.3, the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement shall
be deemed final (with the changes, if any, required by the outcome of
the objection process).

  



  

23      
   



  

4.2.5 Within ten days after the Closing Balance Sheet is deemed final and the
calculations of Closing Net Working Capital and Non-Timber Purchase Price
have been finally determined, (i) in the event that the Estimated Non-Timber
Purchase Price is less than the Non-Timber Purchase Price (as finally
determined), Holdings shall, or shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries
to, make payment to Parent in an amount equal to such shortfall or (ii) in
the event that the Estimated Non-Timber Purchase Price is greater than the
Non-Timber Purchase Price (as finally determined), Parent shall, or shall
cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to, make payment to Holdings in an
amount equal to such excess. Such payment, together with interest
thereon from the date of Closing to the date of payment at the Interest Rate,
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank
account of the party to receive the payment designated by such party.

but only to the extent of the dollar amount reflected therein;

  



  

5.1.2 All liabilities and obligations of Sellers arising from and after the
Closing under the Contracts, Leases and Governmental Authorizations that are
identified, or by the express terms of this Agreement not required to be
identified, in Parents Disclosure Memorandum (other than any Contracts,
Leases and Governmental Authorizations that are listed or described on
Schedule 5.3 as a Retained Liability), but only to the extent such Contracts,
Leases and Governmental Authorizations are assigned to Holdings or a
Permitted Affiliate Purchaser and excluding any liability or obligation

or other regulatory requirements under Environmental Laws immediately after

to, execute any instrument reasonably requested by Parent to reflect such

5.2 **[** Reserved. **]**

  



  

5.3 _Nonassumption of Other Liabilities_. Except as set forth in Section 5.1
of this Agreement, Holdings and its Subsidiaries do not, and will not be
obligated to, assume any other debt, obligation, liability, commitment or
duty of any of Sellers or of any of their respective Subsidiaries of any form
or nature, absolute or contingent, known or unknown (the "Retained
Liabilities"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.1, neither Holdings nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall assume or become liable for any of the Retained
Liabilities set forth on Schedule 5.3. At Closing, Parent shall and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to execute any instrument reasonably requested by
Holdings to reflect Parents continued retention of the Retained Liabilities.

  



  

5.4 _Consents to Assignment_. Parent shall use its best efforts to obtain
any required consent to the assignment of the Contracts, Leases, and
Governmental Authorizations prior to the Closing; provided that Parent shall
not be obligated or permitted (without Holdings written consent) to agree to
any change in the terms of the transferred arrangement which is material in
the context of the particular item being transferred. Holdings shall
reasonably cooperate with Parent to obtain such consents, but shall not be
obligated to make any payment to obtain any consent to assignment.  With
respect to the specific Contracts, Leases and Governmental Authorizations,
other than the Required Consents, if Parent is unable to obtain consent to
the assignment prior to Closing, the Contract, Lease or
Governmental Authorization in question shall be deemed a Retained Asset and
any obligation or liability arising therefrom shall be excluded from the
Assumed Liabilities. The parties shall use their best efforts to arrange and
enter into mirror image purchase and sale arrangements, subleases,
sublicenses, service agreements and other work-around arrangements in respect
of any Contract or Lease so excluded; _provided_  that to the extent, despite
the exercise of best efforts, such arrangements cannot be entered into or
would not place Holdings and its Subsidiaries in substantially the same
economic position as if such Contract, Lease or Governmental Authorization
were able to be assigned, Parent will indemnify Holdings and its Subsidiaries
for the aggregate amount of any costs, expenses, losses, or diminution or
loss of value resulting from the exclusion of any such Contract, Lease or
Governmental Authorization.

the Business.

  



  

7.8 _Taxes_. Except as Disclosed on Schedule 7.8 of Parents Disclosure
Memorandum:

  



  

7.8.1 Sellers and each of their Affiliates (including each of the Transferred

7.8.7 No claim has ever been made by a Tax Authority in a jurisdiction where
any of the Sellers or the Transferred Subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns
that such Seller or Transferred Subsidiary is or may be subject to Taxes
assessed by such jurisdiction.

  



  

7.8.8 None of the Transferred Subsidiaries will be required (A) as a result
of a change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior
to the Closing Date, to include any adjustment in taxable income for any
taxable period (or any portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date, (B) as
a result of any "closing agreement," as described in Section 7121 of the Code
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law), to
include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable
income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing
Date, or (C) as a result of any payment received prior to the Closing or any
installment sale prior to the Closing to include any item of income in any

7.8.9 None of the Transferred Subsidiaries has distributed stock of another
Person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person, in a transaction
that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part by Section

7.9 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

  



  

7.9.1 All of the Employees based in the United States are employed by Parent
except for 42 Employees who are employed by Minnesota, Dakota and Western
Railway Company. None of the Transferred Subsidiaries have Employees except
for Minnesota, Dakota and Western Railway Company, Boise Cascade do Brasil
LTDA, Boise Alljoist Ltd., and Boise Building Products Limited, and none of
the Retained Subsidiaries have any Employees. Upon Holdings request, Parent
will promptly provide a list of each Employee who is on disability leave as
of any date after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing
Date and also as of the Closing Date.

  



  

7.9.2 Schedule 7.9.2(a) of Parents Disclosure Memorandum lists each Parent
Plan, complete and accurate copies of which have been provided (or made
available in the dataroom) to Holdings; _provided_ , however, with respect to
Parent Plans providing benefits to employees outside the United States, if a
complete and accurate copy of such plans has not been

  



  

31      
   



  

provided to Holdings, then summaries of all material terms (including,
without limitation, whether any unfunded liabilities with respect to such
plan exist) have been provided to Buyer. Except as set forth on Schedule
7.9.2(b) of Parents Disclosure Memorandum, no Parent Plan provides for post-
employment welfare benefits to any Employee other than as required under
Section 4980B of the Code.  Except as Disclosed on Schedule 7.9.2(c) of
Parents Disclosure Memorandum, each Parent Plan has been and is being
maintained in substantial compliance with all applicable laws, including
ERISA and the Code, and each plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has received a determination
of such qualification from the Internal Revenue Service. Except as Disclosed
on Schedule 7.9.2(d) of Parents Disclosure Memorandum, no Employee is
covered by a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA
or has been covered by such a plan during the past five years. Except as
provided in Section 11.8 with respect to Holdings General Severance Policy
and the 2004 Severance Agreement, none of the Parent Plans will obligate
Holdings or any Permitted Affiliate Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries or
any Transferred Subsidiary to pay separation, severance, termination or
similar-type benefits in whole or in part as a result of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or as a result of a "change in control" (as
such term is defined in Section 280G of the Code) arising from the execution
and performance of this Agreement. No liability to the PBGC (except for
routine payment of premiums), Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor,
or otherwise has been or is expected to be incurred with respect to any
"employee benefit plan" (as such term is defined under Section 3(3) of ERISA)
that is subject to Title IV of ERISA which could result in a liability to
Holdings or any Permitted Affiliate Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries or
any Transferred Subsidiary. No "change in control" as defined under any
employment or retention agreements of Sellers or their Subsidiaries
applicable to any Employee will occur, and no rights or obligations under any
similar agreement will arise, in whole or in part as a result of the
transactions contemplated herein.

  



  

7.10 _Compliance with Laws; Governmental Authorizations_.  Except as
Disclosed on Schedule 7.10 of Parents Disclosure Memorandum, the Business is
being conducted in substantial compliance with all laws applicable to the
Business, and Sellers and the Transferred Subsidiaries have all material
Governmental Authorizations required for the ongoing conduct of the Business
where and as it is currently being conducted. Parent has no Knowledge of any
intention or commencement of any process by or before any Governmental
Authority to suspend, revoke, materially modify (other than modifications
made in connection with a normal renewal of an expiring Governmental
Authorization) or cancel any such Governmental Authorization, or any claims
by or before any Governmental Authority alleging or investigating any
violation of law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed
by the parties that nothing in this representation is intended to address any
compliance issue that is the subject of the representations and warranties
set forth in Sections 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, 7.11, 7.12, or 7.13 hereof, and that
Sellers make no representations as to the transferability or assignability of
any such Governmental Authorization.

  



  

7.11 _Environmental Matters_. Except as Disclosed on Schedule 7.11 of
Parents Disclosure Memorandum:

  



  

7.11.1 Sellers and the Transferred Subsidiaries have complied at all times
during the past five years with, and are currently in compliance with, all
applicable Environmental Laws

  



  

32      
   



  

applicable to the Business, and there are no liabilities under any
Environmental Law with respect to the Business;

7.11.4 None of Sellers nor any of the Transferred Subsidiaries nor the
Business has any material or potentially material liability with respect to

presence of asbestos or silica in any product or item in, on or beneath any
property, facility or structure (including, without limitation, the
Facilities or the Timberlands) and no damaged and friable asbestos-containing
material is currently present at the Facilities or the Timberlands; and

  



  

7.11.5 Sellers and the Transferred Subsidiaries have made available to
Holdings true and correct copies of all environmental audit reports, action
plans and updated action plans and Environmental Assessments covering the

preceding the date of this Agreement.

  



  

7.12 _Intellectual Property_.

  



  

7.12.1 Schedule 7.12.1 of Parents Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a list
and description (including the country of registration) of all registered
Parent Intellectual Property currently (or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
within the last 12 months) used in the Business. Except as Disclosed,
no third party has rights in or otherwise has the right to restrict Parents
use of such Parent Intellectual Property, and, to Parents Knowledge (without
any inquiry), no third party has rights in, or otherwise has the right to
restrict Holdings and its Subsidiaries use of such Parent Intellectual
Property and the Boise Marks as of and following the Closing.

  



  

7.12.2 To the Knowledge of Parent, no product (or component thereof) or
process currently used, sold, or manufactured by the Business infringes on,
misappropriates, or otherwise violates a valid and enforceable intellectual
property right of any other Person. Any pending or threatened claim of such
infringement Known to Parent is set forth on Schedule 7.12.2 of Parents
Disclosure Memorandum.

  



  

7.12.3 There are no actions or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened, challenging, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no person
is infringing or otherwise violating, the Parent Intellectual Property,
except for challenges, infringements or violations which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

33      
   



  

7.12.4 All of the Parent Intellectual Property used in the Business and all
of Parents and its Subsidiaries interest in the Boise Marks will be
transferred to Holdings at Closing, and such transferred Parent Intellectual
Property and the Boise Marks will be available to Holdings after Closing on
the same terms and conditions under which it was available to Parent and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. The Boise Marks will remain available for
use by Parent in its Boise Office Solutions business for the period and to
the extent permitted in Section 10.6.

  



  

7.13 _Labor Matters_. Except as Disclosed on Schedule 7.13 of Parents
Disclosure Memorandum:

  



  

7.13.1 None of Sellers nor any Transferred Subsidiary is a party to any labor
or collective bargaining agreement with respect to Employees, no Employees
are represented by any labor organization and, to the Knowledge of Parent,
there are no organizing or decertification activities (including any demand
for recognition or certification proceedings pending or threatened to be
brought or filed with the National Labor Relations Board or other labor
relations tribunal) involving any of the Employees;

  



  

7.13.2 There are no strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts, or unfair
labor practice charges pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
against or involving the employees of the Business;

  



  

7.13.3 There are no complaints, charges, claims or grievances against Sellers
or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened to be brought or filed with any governmental authority,
arbitrator or court based on or arising out of the employment of any Employee
by Sellers or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, where the aggregate
potential liability to Sellers or the Transferred Subsidiaries from such
matter if adversely determined is at least $75,000; and

  



  

7.13.4 Each Seller and each Transferred Subsidiary are in substantial
compliance with all laws relating to the employment of labor, including all
such laws relating to wages, hours, collective bargaining, discrimination,
civil rights, safety and health, immigration, workers compensation, layoffs,
and the collection and payment of withholding and/or Social Security Taxes
and similar Taxes except where such noncompliance would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

  



  

7.14 _Contracts_. Schedule 7.14(a) Parents Disclosure Memorandum contains a
list of (a) each Contract which has a remaining unexpired term of at least
one year and requires payments by or to the Business of more than $1,000,000
in any year; (b) all Contracts which require payment (other than for the
provision of goods or services in the ordinary course of business) by or to
the Business of more than $1,000,000; (c) any Contract that contains a non-
compete covenant or similar provision that could restrict Holdings in
its conduct of the Business following Closing, (d) any consulting,
retention, severance, bonus, compensation, or similar agreement with any
Employee, other than the Parent Plans, and any employment agreement with any
Employee (other than temporary employment contracts that are terminable
without penalty at any time at the will of the employer with a term of less
than one year and at an annual compensation rate of less than $75,000 and
that provide for no payments of severance), (e) all

  



  

34      
   



  

collective bargaining agreements affecting any of the Employees, (f) any
Contract between any of Sellers or any Retained Subsidiary on one hand and
any of Sellers, any Retained Subsidiary, or any Transferred Subsidiary on the
other hand, which is related to the Business, other than purchase orders
entered into in the ordinary course of business and included in Trade
Intercompany Accounts, and (g) any other Contract that is material to the
Business or the Assets. Each Contract required to be disclosed on Schedule
7.14(a) of Parents Disclosure Memorandum is a valid and binding agreement of
Sellers or a Transferred Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of Parent, is in
full force and effect.  Except as Disclosed on Schedule 7.14(b) of Parents
Disclosure Memorandum, none of the Sellers or any Transferred Subsidiary is
in, and, to Parents Knowledge, no other party thereto is in, default in any
material respect under any Contract required to be disclosed in such
Schedule. Parents Disclosures made pursuant to this Section 7.14 include all
Contracts that are material to the Business. Solely for purposes of this
Section, the term Contract is deemed to also include any such instrument
which is held by a Transferred Subsidiary rather than one of Sellers.
Schedule 7.14(c) of Parents Disclosure Memorandum also identifies which of
the Contracts listed thereon may not be transferred to Holdings and its
Subsidiaries (including indirectly by transfer of the stock of the
Transferred Subsidiaries) without the consent of the counterparty thereto or
for which rights or obligations of any party thereto will (with or without
the passage of time), without the consent of the other party(ies) thereto,
terminate, accelerate, be modified or otherwise become due.

  



  

7.15 _Leases_. Schedule 7.15(a) of Parents Disclosure Memorandum sets forth
a list of: (i) each Timberlands Lease; (ii) each Equipment Lease with a
remaining term of more than one month and rental payments in excess of
$1,000,000 in the aggregate for such lease or which covers equipment with an
original purchase cost in excess of $5,000,000; and (iii) each Facilities
Lease, together with, for each such Timberlands Lease, the general location
and approximate acreage, and for each such Facilities Lease, the address of
each parcel of real property subject to such Lease. Sellers have delivered to
Holdings true and correct copies of each such Lease, other than the following
Leases, true and correct copies of which will be delivered within ten working
days after the date hereof: (i) resource management agreements marked with
an asterisk on Schedule 7.15, each of which is substantially similar to the
form of resource management agreement previously delivered to Holdings, and
which are not (individually or in the aggregate) materially adverse to
Holdings and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) timber cutting contracts marked with
an asterisk on Schedule 7.15, as to each of which Schedule 7.15 describes the
acreage covered thereby and the unexpired term thereof, and which are not
(individually or in the aggregate) materially adverse to Holdings and its
Subsidiaries.  Each of the Leases is a valid and binding agreement of Parent
or Southern, as the case may be, and is in full force and effect. There are
no defaults under any leases which defaults have not been cured or waived
and which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. None of the Transferred Subsidiaries holds any Timberlands
Leases or any Equipment Lease or Facilities Lease which would meet the
threshold for disclosure on such Schedule. Parents Disclosures made pursuant
to this Section 7.15 include all Leases that are material to the Business.
Solely for purposes of this Section 7.15, the terms Timberlands Lease,
Equipment Lease, and Facilities Lease are deemed to also include any such
instrument which is held by a Transferred Subsidiary rather than one of
Sellers. Schedule 7.15(b) of Parents Disclosure Memorandum also identifies
which of the Leases listed thereon may not be transferred to Holdings and its
Subsidiaries without the consent of the counter-party thereto or for which
rights or obligations of any party thereto will

  



  

35      
   



  

(with or without the passage of time), without the consent of the other
party(ies) thereto, terminate, accelerate, be modified or otherwise become
due.

  



  

7.16 _Entire Business; Title to Property; Capital Structure of Transferred
Subsidiaries_.

  



  

7.16.1 Except as Disclosed on Schedule 7.16.1 of Parents Disclosure
Memorandum, the Assets (including the Timberlands, Facilities, and Fixtures
and Equipment held pursuant to the Leases, and Intellectual Property covered
by the IP Licenses) together with the assets held by the Transferred
Subsidiaries, and the rights specifically provided or made available to
Holdings and its Subsidiaries under the Ancillary Agreements, include all of
the buildings, machinery, equipment and other assets (whether tangible or
intangible) necessary and adequate for Holdings and its Subsidiaries
immediately after Closing to conduct in all material respects the Business as
conducted as of the date hereof and since March 31, 2004. None of the
Assets is held by, and no aspect of the Business is conducted by, and (except
with respect to the balance sheet and profit and loss statements of the
corporate staff operations) the Historical Financial Statements do not
include any of the financial condition or results of operations of, any of
the Retained Subsidiaries or any other Person other than the Sellers and the
Transferred Subsidiaries. Schedule 7.16.1 sets forth a description of any
and all assets (whether tangible or intangible, real or personal) used in the
conduct of the Business, but which do not fall within the definition of
"Assets".  Schedule D-13 lists the county and approximate acreage of
the Timberlands. Except for the Timberlands and the Retained HBU Lands, none
of Sellers or any of the Retained Subsidiaries owns or leases any real
property for the purpose of growing or harvesting timber. The letters of
credit and performance bonds to be assumed by Holdings and its Subsidiaries
at the Closing are substantially as set forth on Schedule 7.16.1 of Parents
Disclosure Memorandum, and in any event the aggregate amount thereof shall
not exceed $110 million.

  



  

7.16.2 Except as Disclosed on Schedule 7.16.2 of Parents Disclosure
Memorandum, Sellers and the Transferred Subsidiaries have good (and, in the
case of the Realty and the Timberlands (as applicable), marketable) title to
the Assets, free and clear of all Financial Encumbrances and all other
Encumbrances except (i) liens for Taxes (which are not related to income,
sales, or withholding Taxes), assessments and other governmental charges not
yet due and payable or due but not delinquent as of the Closing Date or being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings; (ii) mechanics,
workmens, repairmens, warehousemens, carriers, or other like liens arising
or incurred in the ordinary course of business for amounts which are not
delinquent and which will not individually or in the aggregate materially
impair the operation of the Business, original purchase price conditional
sales contracts and equipment leases with third parties entered into in the
ordinary course of business; (iii) with respect to the Realty and
Timberlands, (A) easements, quasi-easements, licenses, covenants, rights-of-
way and other similar restrictions, including any other agreements,
conditions, restrictions, or other matters which would be shown by a current
title report or other similar report or listing, (B) any conditions that may
be shown by a current survey (other than, for purposes of Section 15.1.12,
Surveys delivered pursuant to Section 9.1.3), title report or physical
inspection, and (C) zoning, building and other similar restrictions, none of
which Encumbrances in (A) through (C) materially impairs the uses of the
Realty or Timberlands as currently used in the Business or materially
detracts from the value thereof as currently used in the Business; (iv) with
respect to the Timberlands, such encroachments, boundary line disputes,
access restrictions or absence of

  



  

36      
   



  

access, adverse possession claims, and other Encumbrances (other than
Financial Encumbrances) which are common to commercial timberlands and will
not individually or in the aggregate materially impair the operation of the
Timberlands or materially detract from the value of the Timberlands; and (v)
Encumbrances not described in items (i) - (iv) immediately preceding which
are not Financial Encumbrances and which, individually or in the aggregate,
would not materially impair the operation of the Business or materially
detract from the value of the Business (all items included in (i) through
(v), including any matter Disclosed on Schedule 7.16.2 of Parents Disclosure
Memorandum, are referred to collectively herein as the "Permitted
Encumbrances"); provided, however, that as of the Closing Date and for any
periods of time thereafter (including for purposes of Section 2.1 and Article
IX), "Permitted Encumbrances" shall not include any Financial Encumbrances.
 Solely for purposes of this Section 7.16.2, each reference to the Assets
and each subcategory thereof is intended to include any such asset held by a
Transferred Subsidiary.

  



  

7.16.3 Parent owns, directly or indirectly, all of the shares of issued and
outstanding stock or other equity interests of the Transferred Subsidiaries,
and no shares of stock or other equity interests of any indirectly owned
Transferred Subsidiary are held by any Retained Subsidiary. All shares of
stock or other equity interests of the Transferred Subsidiaries are validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable.  Except as Disclosed on Schedule
7.16.3(a) of Parents Disclosure Memorandum, (i) there are no options,
warrants, or similar rights to purchase any of the shares of any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries, and no obligations binding upon any Transferred
Subsidiary to issue, sell, redeem, purchase or exchange any of its capital
stock or any right relating thereto, and (ii) there are no shareholders
agreements, voting agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or rights of
third parties with respect to or affecting any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries or any of their shares of stock.

  



  

7.16.4 The Assets and the assets of the Transferred Subsidiaries are in
operating condition and repair (subject to normal wear and tear) and are in a
condition to allow the continued conduct after the Closing by Holdings of the
Business as it is currently conducted in all material respects. With respect
to the Assets and the assets of the Transferred Subsidiaries, Parent has not
failed to make or deferred or postponed any maintenance, repair, capital
improvement, or capital expenditure in anticipation of a potential sale of
all or part of the Business, including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Except as set forth in this
paragraph and otherwise set forth in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements, all of the Assets will be sold AS IS and WHERE IS as to the
Sellers.

  



  

7.16.5 Except as set forth on Schedule 7.16.5 of Parents Disclosure
Memorandum, none of the Sellers or their Retained Subsidiaries or any officer
or director thereof, or any individual related by blood, marriage or adoption
to any such individual or any entity in which any such Person or individual
owns any beneficial interest, is a party to any Contract with any of Sellers
or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or has any interest in any property,
asset, or right used by Sellers or any Transferred Subsidiary or necessary
for the Business. Schedule 7.16.5 of Parents Disclosure Memorandum describes
all services provided to or for the benefit of the Business by any portion of
Sellers not included in the Business and any of the Retained Subsidiaries.

  



  

37      
   



  

7.16.6 Since March 31, 2004, Sellers and their Subsidiaries have operated
the Timberlands in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, including (a) conducting their on-going timber harvest operations
on the Timberlands substantially in accordance with the species composition,
timber products, volume levels, and timing detailed in Parents Harvest Plan,
and (b) performing necessary and prudent maintenance of roads, drainage
systems, fire protection and prevention as well as appropriate stand
establishment activities.

  



  

7.17 _Finders  Fees_. Except for the fees of Goldman Sachs and Co., whose
fees will be paid by Parent, there is no investment banker, broker or finder
which has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Parent who
might be entitled to any fee or commission from Holdings or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

7.18 _Insurance_. Except as Disclosed on Schedule 7.18 of Parents Disclosure
Memorandum, Schedule D-14 hereto identifies each of the insurance policies
currently carried by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which cover risks
associated with or arising out of the Business. The column marked "status"
indicates for each policy whether it will be retained by Sellers (those
policies labeled as "excluded"); fully assigned to Holdings (those policies
labeled as "assigned"); or divided between the parties in accordance with
Section 10.1.1 (those policies labeled as "divided"). In addition, the
status column indicates which of the assigned or divided policies will name
Parent and the Retained Subsidiaries as additional insureds. The policies
listed in Schedule D-14 as "excluded" will be retained by Sellers and shall
constitute Retained Assets. The policies listed in Schedule D-14 as
"assigned" shall be included in the Assets to be transferred hereunder. The
policies listed in Schedule D-14 as "divided" shall be included as Assets to
be transferred hereunder to the extent of the contemplated assignment and as
a Retained Asset to the extent of the carved out retained coverages. For
each of the Insurance Policies listed thereon, Schedule D-14 sets forth (a)
the name of the insurer, the name of the policyholder, and the name of each
covered insured, (b) the scope, period and amount of coverage, and (c) a
description of any retroactive premium adjustments or other loss sharing
arrangements (including any self-insured retention, deductible or similar
self-insurance or co-insurance in respect of each such insurance policy).
Parent has paid all premiums or other amounts due and owing to such insurers
in respect of each policy listed on Schedule D-14 and is not otherwise in
default under any such policy.

  



  

7.19 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. No Seller nor any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries has any material obligations or liabilities (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent, unliquidated or otherwise, whether or not known to
Parent, whether due or to become due and regardless of when asserted) arising
out of transactions entered into at or prior to the Closing or any action or
inaction at or prior to the Closing or any state of facts existing at or
prior to the Closing other than: (i) liabilities recorded or disclosed on the
December 31, 2003 balance sheet included in the Historical Financial
Statements (including any notes thereto, if any); (ii) liabilities and
obligations arising from or in connection with matters Disclosed pursuant to
Parents representations and warranties in this Agreement or in the
Disclosure Memorandum (none of which, except as Disclosed pursuant to Section
7.7, is a liability resulting from a breach of contract,

  



  

38      
   



  

breach of warranty, tort, infringement claim or lawsuit); (iii) liabilities
and obligations which have arisen after December 31, 2003, in the ordinary
course of business (none of which, except as Disclosed pursuant to Section
7.7, is a liability resulting from a breach of contract, breach of warranty,
tort, infringement claim or lawsuit); (iv) its long term indebtedness and
other long term liabilities which are carried on its books at the corporate
level and are not Assumed Liabilities; and (v) any Retained Liabilities.

  



  

7.20 _No Other Representations or Warranties_.  Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article 7, neither Parent
nor any other Person makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty on behalf of any of Sellers. ANY WARRANTY IMPLIED BY LAW
INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.

  



  

7.21 _Closing Date_. The representations and warranties of Sellers contained
in this Article 7 and elsewhere in this Agreement and all information
contained in any exhibit, schedule or attachment hereto or in any certificate
or other writing delivered by, or on behalf of, any of Sellers to Holdings
pursuant to this Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects on the
Closing Date as though then made, except as affected by the transactions
expressly contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall have the right, at any
time prior to the fifth business day prior to the Closing Date to update the
portion of the Parent Disclosure Memorandum prepared in respect of the
representations and warranties of Sellers in this Article VII to reflect
changes in the Business between the date hereof and the Closing Date that are
actions taken by Parent permitted under Section 10.2 without Holdings prior
consent or were actions not permitted thereby which were taken with Holdings
consent.

  



  

In the event any litigation or claim against any of the Sellers or their
Subsidiaries relating to the Business (other than the Transferred
Litigation), or any action, complaint, charge, claim, grievance, or other
labor matter of the type described in Section 7.13, arises after the date
hereof and prior the Closing, then (a) Parent will promptly deliver written
notice to Holdings of the nature of such matter and will provide to Holdings
all information concerning such matter as Holdings reasonably requests; (b)
Holdings may elect to assume such matter by delivering written notice of such
assumption to Parent, in which case a reserve will be established for such
matter (which reserve will be determined in accordance with Parents
historical practices and methods for establishing and adjusting book reserves
relating to litigation and other claims liabilities and will be reasonably
acceptable to Holdings), and such reserve will be added to Schedule D-6 and
included in the Litigation and Claims Reserve; and (c) if Holdings elects not
to, or does not, assume such matter in writing as described in clause (b)
above, then such matter will be treated as Retained Litigation, and all

 ** _Article 9_** ** _ Realty_**

  



  

9.1 _Title Reports_.

  



  

9.1.1 Parent has ordered from First American Title Company ("Title Company")
preliminary title reports on (i) all of the Timberlands (including the
timberlands held pursuant to long term leases and those held in the form of
perpetual cutting rights); (ii) all of the Realty (including realty owned by
Transferred Subsidiaries (other than Boise Cascade do Brasil LTDA

  



  

41      
   



  

and Compania Industrial Puerto Montt, S.A.); and (iii) the Facility Leases
covering the Jackson, Alabama Facility (collectively, the "Titled Property").
Parent will provide such preliminary title reports to Holdings as they are
received.  Parent shall provide reasonable cooperation with Holdings and
Title Company in the review and examination of the title to the Realty and
the Timberlands. Such cooperation shall include providing access to Parents
Realty and Timberlands records and including available maps and surveys.

  



  

9.1.2 Parent and Holdings shall cooperate with the Title Company and use
commercially reasonable efforts so that Holdings shall have obtained (a) no
later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing, a commitment from the Title
Company for an ALTA Owners Title Insurance Policy, 1992 Form (or other form
of policy acceptable to Purchaser), together with a copy of all documents
referenced therein (the "Title Commitments"), and (b) at Closing, title
insurance policies from the Title Company (which may be in the form of a
mark-up of a pro forma of the Title Commitments) in accordance with the Title
Commitments, insuring Purchasers fee simple title to each owned Titled
Property or Holdings legal, valid, binding and enforceable leasehold
interest in each leased Titled Property (as the case may be) (in each case,
excluding the Timberlands except to the extent required by Holdings or its
Affiliates lenders) as of the Closing Date (including all recorded
appurtenant easements necessary for access to Titled Property and insured as
separate legal parcels) with gap coverage from Parent through the date of
recording and extended coverage over the general exceptions, subject only to
Permitted Encumbrances, in such amount as Holdings reasonably determines to
be the value of the Titled Property insured thereunder (the "Title
Policies").  Sellers shall execute any affidavits, indemnities and other
agreements or assurances reasonably required by the Title Company to issue
the Title Policies. The fees, costs and expenses with respect to the Title
Commitments and Title Policies, including ALTA extended coverage, shall be
borne equally by Parent and Holdings; provided that 100% of the premium or
fee for deletion of the creditors rights exception will be borne by Holdings.

  



  

9.1.3 Holdings shall have obtained no later than ten (10) days prior to the
Closing, a survey for each property set forth on Schedule 9.1.3 dated no
earlier than the date of this Agreement, prepared by a licensed surveyor
reasonably satisfactory to Holdings, and conforming to 1997 ALTA/ACSM Minimum
Detail Requirements for Land Title Surveys, including Table A Items Nos. 1,
2, 3, 4, 6, 7(a), 7(b)(1), 7(c), 8, 9, 10, 11(b), 13, 14 15 and 16, or such
lesser standards as the Title Company requires as a condition to the removal
of any survey exceptions from the Title Policies in respect of such
properties, and certified to Holdings, Holdings lender and the Title
Company, in a form satisfactory to each of such parties (the "Surveys"). The
fees, costs and expenses with respect to the Surveys shall be borne equally
by Parent and Holdings.

  



  

9.2 _Conveyancing_. At Closing, Sellers will convey the Realty to Holdings or
its designated Permitted Affiliate Purchasers and the Timberlands to Timber
Co. or its designee, in each case by special limited warranty deeds (the
"Deeds") in a form customary and suitable for recordation in each applicable
jurisdiction and sufficient to convey fee simple title to the Realty and
Timberlands, subject only to Permitted Encumbrances, and otherwise in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Holdings. For the avoidance of
doubt, when used in this paragraph the term "special limited warranty deed"
shall be interpreted to mean a customary form of deed in which the warranties
of Sellers relate only to the period during which the Sellers had title, and
in

  



  

42      
   



  

which Sellers represent that they have no knowledge that such warranties are
untrue for any period prior thereto.

  



  

9.3 _Environmental Assessments_. Parent has delivered or will deliver to
Purchasers within 45 days after the date hereof environmental assessments
(each an "Environmental Assessment") prepared in accordance with ASTM 1527-00
for each Facility (including Facilities owned by Transferred Subsidiaries),
other than (i) Facilities and properties owned by Compania Industrial Puerto
Montt, S.A.; (ii) Facilities leased by Boise Building Products Limited; and
(iii) Facilities which are leased commercial office space. In addition,
Parent will deliver within 60 days after the date hereof Environmental
Assessments prepared in accordance with a modified version of ASTM 1528-00
covering all of the Timberlands and the eucalyptus plantations owned by Boise
Cascade do Brasil LTDA. If any of such Environmental Assessments report (or
disclose any environmental issue that Holdings reasonably determines could
constitute) a Recognized Environmental Condition, as defined in the above-
referenced ASTM standards (a "REC"), the following procedure shall be
utilized by the parties to address the issue presented by such REC:

  



  

9.3.1 Parent and Holdings shall review each Environmental Assessment as it is
made available by Parent. Within 10 days after receipt of each such
Environmental Assessment (or within 10 days after the date hereof in the case
of Environmental Assessments received prior to execution of this Agreement)
either party may request that further investigation of the REC be conducted
by a contractor designated by the requesting party or if it is requested by
both parties by a contractor agreed upon by the parties, with the expense of
the further investigation to be shared equally by the parties. In either case,
the results of the additional investigation shall be made available to both
parties and the scope of the investigation and technical details shall be
consented to by both parties, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

9.3.2 Following the receipt of such additional investigation or if neither
party requests any investigation Holdings may at its option either: (i)
delete the affected Facility or Timberlands parcel or the affected portion of
the Facility or Timberlands parcel from the transaction (and such deleted
parcel or portion thereof shall be a Retained Asset and shall not be included
in the definition of Facility or Timberlands); or (ii) take no action in
which case the affected Facility or Timberlands parcel shall remain a portion
of the Assets. If Holdings takes no action within ten days after expiration
of the 10 day period provided for in Section 9.3.1 without a request by
either party for additional investigation or within 10 days after receipt of
any final report resulting from additional investigation, it shall be deemed
to have elected option (ii) under the preceding sentence.

  



  

9.3.2.1 In the event that Holdings elects to delete the affected Facility or
Timberlands parcel (or the affected portion thereof), the Timberlands
Purchase Price or the Non-Timber Purchase Price, as appropriate, shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect the value of the Asset so deleted; and

  



  

9.3.2.2 In the event that Holdings elects not to delete the affected Facility
or Timberlands Parcel or affected portion thereof, the transaction shall be
completed without adjustment of either the Non-Timber Purchase Price or the
Timberlands Purchase Price and any liability incurred by Holdings or its
subsidiaries in respect of the conditions in such REC

  



  

43      
   



  

shall be a Retained Environmental Liability ( _provided_ that Holdings shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy as promptly as practicable
after Closing such condition with the proceeds of indemnification therefor).

  



  

9.3.3 Holdings shall have no obligation to attend and carry out the actions
required of it at the Closing, as set forth in Section 15.1.8, if the matters
identified in the Environmental Assessments could reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

 ** _Article 10_** ** _ Covenants of the Parties_**

  



  

10.1 _Access_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers and the Transferred Subsidiaries
will permit Holdings and the Permitted Affiliate Purchasers and their
respective financing sources and representatives to have full access, during

consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), other advisors), subject to
reasonable rules and regulations of Parent concerning visitors to its
Facilities, and shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Holdings any
financial and operating data and other information that is available with
respect to the Business, the Assets, or the Assumed Liabilities as Holdings
shall from time to time reasonably request. Holdings shall abide by the terms

information furnished to it or its representatives pursuant to this Section
10.1. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Holdings shall not be
permitted to perform any invasive testing of any of the Realty without
specific additional authorization from Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), or to perform any testing which would cause a breach
of any Lease to which Parent is a party, provided that, upon request from
Holdings, Parent shall use reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary consent
to permit such testing.

  



  

10.2 _Conduct of Business_. During the period from the date hereof to the
Closing, except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or as Holdings

the foregoing, Parent may sell the Retained HBU Lands (and any proceeds
therefrom will be retained by Parent) and may sell not more than 500
additional acres of Timberlands in the aggregate transferred in the ordinary
course. The Timberlands Purchase Price shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by
the amount of the proceeds (net of transaction costs) from all such ordinary
course sales (other than sales of the Retained HBU Lands) pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, and such proceeds shall not be included as a
Current Asset in the determination of Closing Net Working Capital nor as cash
that increases the purchase price pursuant to Section 3.2.4. Notwithstanding
and in addition to the foregoing, Parent may pledge Accounts Receivable

partial liquidation of such program, so long as such pledge is released at

lease or other accounting or engage in any activity which would accelerate

Inventory (including raw material, packaging, work-in-process, or finished
goods) on hand; or reduce or otherwise change any book reserves relating to
workers compensation, litigation, and other claims liabilities other than as
set forth in the definitions of Workers Compensation Reserve and Litigation

whether or not engaged in a business similar to the Business; provided that
nothing in this Section 10.2.1.5 shall preclude any acquisition by Boise

office products distribution business, so long as such transaction would have
no effect on the Business, the Assets, the Transferred Subsidiaries, or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

10.2.1.6 sell, transfer, or grant licenses of Intellectual Property to any
Person or allow registered Intellectual Property to lapse, expire, or become

accomplishing the transfers contemplated

  



  

45      
   



  

under Sections 11.4 and 11.5; and provided further that nothing in the
foregoing shall preclude Boise from entering into the 2004 Severance
Agreements with its executive officers as set forth on Schedule D-19, or from
adopting the 2004 Retention Bonus Plan for key employees as set forth on
Schedule D-18;

and shall cause its Subsidiaries to:

  



  

10.2.2.1 use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) preserve intact the

maintain satisfactory relationships with its material suppliers and customers
and other Persons having business relationships with it, and (iv) maintain

Assets in accordance with its normal and customary maintenance practices and

business in an aggregate amount consistent with the 2004 Capital Spending
Authorizations for the Business; provided that, so long as Parent and its
Subsidiaries have exercised reasonable commercial efforts as required by the
preceding phrase, the foregoing shall not constitute an absolute guaranty
that all planned capital expenditures will be completed as scheduled in such
authorizations;

  



  

46   

     

  



  

#### 10.2.2.3 promptly, but in any event within two (2) business days after

## 10.3 _Efforts to Achieve Closing_. Each of Parent and Holdings will use
commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill the conditions precedent to the
others respective obligations hereunder and to secure all Consents required
to be obtained by it in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
and Parent and Holdings will cooperate in all reasonable requests to fulfill
the conditions precedent to their and the other partys obligations described

not later than the Outside Date. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing,

  



  

### 10.3.1 Parent and Holdings will file within 10 Business Days of the date
hereof the required notice (including all documentary materials) under the

and Holdings.

  



  

### 10.3.2 Holdings shall, and shall cause each of its respective
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable efforts to satisfy all conditions precedent
to be satisfied by Holdings or its Affiliates in the Commitment Letters and
to otherwise obtain, on behalf of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, the proceeds

Letters; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 10.3.2 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall require (i) the payment by Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries of any material amount of cash other than as required by the
Debt Commitment Letters or any fee letters executed in connection with the
Debt Commitment Letters, (ii) the agreement by Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries to any material economic terms other than those contemplated by
either the Debt Commitment Letters

  



  

47      
   



  

or the Equity Commitment Letter or to other terms that are not commercially
reasonable, or (iii) Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries to seek to obtain
any alternative financing in the event that any portion of the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or the Equity Commitment Letter
is unavailable.

  



  

### 10.3.3 Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to cooperate with Holdings
in connection with the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters,
including using (and causing its Subsidiaries to use) reasonable efforts to
satisfy all conditions precedent to be satisfied by Parent and its
Subsidiaries in the Commitment Letters, providing information to and
permitting the financing sources and their representatives access to the

causing the present and former independent accountants for Parent to
participate in drafting sessions related to the offering materials for the

papers available to Holdings and its Subsidiaries, the underwriters for the
debt financing and their respective representatives; provided that Holdings
shall endeavor to minimize the interference with the ability of such senior
management members to carry out their normal responsibilities for ongoing
management of the Business resulting from such participation in drafting
sessions and the road show. Out of pocket costs incurred by Parent
for participation by its external accountants, outside counsel, and other
outside advisors and consultants in the foregoing shall be paid by Holdings;
provided that the fees of KPMG for preparation of the Regulation S-X
Financial Statements shall be shared equally by Parent and Holdings.

cause its Subsidiaries to:

  

## 

  

### 10.4.1 cause all inter-company indebtedness owed by any Transferred
Subsidiary to Parent or a Retained Subsidiary or by Parent or a Retained
Subsidiary to a Transferred Subsidiary, to be eliminated so that at Closing
there will be no inter-company indebtedness between Parent (or its Retained
Subsidiaries) and any Transferred Subsidiaries, except for Trade Intercompany
Accounts; and

  

### 

  

### 10.4.2 cause each Transferred Subsidiary which holds any assets which are
not related to the Business to transfer such assets to Parent or a Retained
Subsidiary; and cause each Transferred Subsidiary which has any obligations
constituting Retained Liabilities to assign such obligations to Parent, and
Parent will assume such Retained Liabilities.

  

### 

  

### 10.4.3 Parent shall indemnify Holdings and each Transferred Subsidiary
for any loss, liability or Tax incurred by Holdings or such Transferred
Subsidiary in connection with the actions referred to in Section 10.4.1 and

48      
   



  

## or its respective obligations hereunder or obtain the benefits
contemplated hereby and to confirm to third parties the transfer of Assets
and the Assumed Liabilities provided for herein. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Holdings agrees that if any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries are found to own assets that are not related to the
Business, or if any Retained Assets are inadvertently transferred to
Holdings, Holdings, or its applicable Permitted Affiliate Purchaser, shall
transfer or cause the Transferred Subsidiary to transfer such assets to
Parent, or as Parent shall direct, at Parents expense (including any Tax
incurred by Holdings or its Subsidiaries) but without consideration.
Similarly, if, after the Closing, Parent or Holdings identifies any assets
that should have been transferred to Holdings as part of the Assets, but were
not, Parent shall transfer such assets to Holdings, or a designated Permitted
Affiliate Purchaser at Parents expense and without further consideration. A
similar process shall be followed with Assumed Liabilities and Retained
Liabilities which are not properly transferred or retained.

  

## 

  

## 10.6 _Use of Boise Marks_. As soon as commercially practicable after
Closing, Parent and its Retained Subsidiaries shall discontinue the use of
the Boise Marks.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following specific
limitations shall be observed by Parent:

  

## 

  

### 10.6.1 Parent and its Retained Subsidiary, Boise Cascade Office Products
Corporation, shall change their names to a variant of OfficeMax or other name
not including the words "Boise" nor "Cascade" within five business days after
Closing and the legal names of Parents remaining Retained Subsidiaries shall
be changed to eliminate the words "Boise" and "Cascade" within three months
after Closing.

  

### 

  

### 10.6.2 Within 60 days after Closing, Parent shall change its New York
Stock Exchange Trading Symbol from BCC to OMX.

  

### 

  

### 10.6.3 Existing stocks of printed stationary, including letterhead,
invoices, acknowledgements and checkstock (for bank accounts not included in
the Assets) may continue to be used for up to three months. Where possible
without unreasonable effort or expense, such stationary shall be stamped or
overprinted before use to disclose the correct identity of the user.

  

### 

  

### 10.6.4 Signage on facilities and rolling stock shall be changed over
within three years and five years, respectively; and

  

### 

  

### 10.6.5 Parents office products catalogs and other marketing materials
shall not utilize the Boise Marks in the 2006 catalog cycle or thereafter.

  

### 

  

Nothing in the foregoing shall preclude Parent from using appropriate Boise
Marks associated with paper products supplied to it by Holdings after Closing
in the remarketing of any such products through its office
products distribution business so long as such use is limited to, and clearly
identified with, such Holdings products and is otherwise consistent with any
terms that Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries imposes on the use of the
Boise Marks with its customers. In no event shall Parent or any of the
Retained Subsidiaries use the Boise Marks in any manner not used by them in
the 12 month period prior to the date hereof or in connection with goods or
services of a different character or quality than those offered by them prior
to the date hereof.

  



  

49      
   



  

Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to clarify any confusion
concerning their respective identities which arises after Closing. Parent
shall indemnify Holdings against third party claims asserted against Holdings
arising from any use by Parent or its Retained Subsidiaries of the Boise
Marks after the Closing.

  



  

## 10.7 _Certain Matters Related To Retained and Assumed Liabilities_.

  

## 

  

### 10.7.1 With respect to all Retained Liabilities, Holdings Indemnified
Parties shall reasonably cooperate with Parent, provide Parent as promptly as
possible with notices and other information received by such parties as well
as all relevant materials, information and data requested by Parent and shall
grant Parent, without charge, such reasonable access to employees of the
Business and to the Assets as may be reasonably necessary for Parent to
defend against, settle, and discharge the Retained Liabilities.

  

### 

  

### 10.7.2 With respect to all Assumed Liabilities, Parent Indemnified
Parties shall reasonably cooperate with Holdings, provide Holdings as
promptly as possible with notices and other information received by such
parties as well as all relevant materials, information and data requested by
Holdings and shall grant Holdings, without charge, such reasonable access to
employees of Parent as may be reasonably necessary for Holdings to defend
against, settle, and discharge the Assumed Liabilities.

  

### 

  

## 10.8 _Inter-company Agreements_.

  

## 

  

### 10.8.1 Parent (on the one hand) and Boise Office Solutions (on the other
hand) shall, during the period between the date hereof and Closing, perform
in the ordinary course and refrain from amending the BOS Paper Sales
Agreement (except as set forth in Section 18.2) and shall not grant to either
party any material waiver of the provisions of such contract which will have
any effect after Closing. Parent shall take such actions as may be necessary
to cause Boise Office Solutions to comply with the foregoing covenant.

  

### 

  

### 10.8.2 All other inter-company agreements between Parent and any of its
Affiliates which relate to the conduct of the Business or between any
Transferred Subsidiary and Parent or a Retained Subsidiary shall be
terminated prior to Closing and all liabilities and obligations arising
thereunder and any other intercompany accounts, indebtedness, liabilities, or
obligations shall be fully discharged prior to Closing, except for any Trade
Intercompany Accounts.

  

### 

  

### 10.8.3 Parent shall indemnify Holdings and each Transferred Subsidiary
for any loss, liability or Tax incurred by Holdings or such Transferred
Subsidiary in connection with the actions referred to in Section 10.8.1 and
Section 10.8.2.

  

### 

  

## 10.9 _Records and Retention and Access_. Holdings shall keep and preserve
in an organized and retrievable manner the Retained Records in its possession
at Closing and the Transferred Records for the lesser of (i) seven years from
the Closing Date or (ii) the retention period for such records under the
longer of Holdings or Parents records retention schedules applicable to
such records. Upon expiration of such period for any specific Transferred
Record or Retained Record, Holdings shall notify Parent that it intends to
destroy such records unless

  



  

50      
   



  

## Parent takes possession of them within 60 days following such notice and
upon expiration of such period may promptly destroy any such record not taken
by Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may take possession of the
Retained Records at any time on 30 days notice to Holdings. While such
Retained Records and Transferred Records remain in existence, each party
shall allow the other party, its representatives, attorneys and accountants,
at the requesting partys expense, access to the Books and Records upon
reasonable request and advance notice and during normal business hours,
subject to the confidentiality provisions set forth in Section 19.18.
 Holdings obligations with respect to such records shall
include maintaining, for at least the retention period specified above,
computer systems permitting access to any of such records which are stored in
electronic form in a fashion which is not less efficient than current access
methods.

  

## 

  

## 10.10 _Insurance_.

  

## 

  

### 10.10.1 Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for
assignment of each policy which under the terms of Schedule D-14 is indicated
to be an "assigned" policy. For those policies which are required by
Schedule D-14 to be divided, Sellers shall, in consultation with Holdings,
use commercially reasonable efforts to either arrange a carve out of an
appropriate portion of the coverage for the benefit of Holdings (or
Sellers if the policy is to be transferred to Holdings) or arrange for the
cancellation and reissue of the divided policy as two policies of like
coverage, limits, deductible, and other material terms for the respective
benefit of Sellers and Holdings. The assigned policies and the portions of
the partially assigned policies to be assigned and any replacement policies
issued to Holdings as a result of a policy which is divided shall be the
"Transferred Insurance Policies".  Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be
additional insureds on the Transferred Insurance Policies to the extent
indicated in Schedule D-14; _provided_  that notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall not have any obligations
to process claims on behalf of Parent and its Subsidiaries except to the
extent provided under the Mutual Administrative Services Agreement.

  

### 

  

### 10.10.2 Sellers covenant and agree that (i) each Seller shall, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates to, continue to maintain, without amendment or
modification, the Transferred Insurance Policies (or if such policies are
terminated, substantially equivalent policies) for the benefit of the
Business, with respect to occurrences prior to the Closing Date, regardless
of whether claims are brought prior to or after the Closing Date; (ii) prior
to Closing, Sellers shall give notice to the insurers under the Transferred
Insurance Policies and other policies of each claim then pending or
threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any of
the Assets or the Business which they reasonably expect to exceed 50% of the
applicable deductible or other loss retention feature of the applicable
Transferred Insurance Policies; (iii) Holdings and its Subsidiaries will,
with respect to the Assets and the Business, be provided full coverage under
the Transferred Insurance Policies after the Closing (subject only to
deductibles, self-insured retentions and policy limits set forth on Schedule
D-14), with respect to occurrences prior to and/or after the Closing,
regardless of whether claims are brought prior to or after the Closing; (iv)
after Closing, Holdings and its Subsidiaries will have the right to bring
claims (whenever brought) as a direct insured party under the Transferred
Insurance Policies for all occurrences that relate to actions, events,
conditions and/or operations of the Assets and the Business prior to and/or
after the Closing Date within the scope of the Transferred
Insurance Policies; and (v) Sellers shall cause Holdings and its Subsidiaries
to be "additional insureds"

  



  

51      
   



  

### under each insurance policy that affected any portion of the Assets or
the Business which is not a Transferred Insurance Policy and shall ensure
that Holdings and its Subsidiaries will, in such capacity, have the same
coverage under such insurance after the Closing as existed for the Business
and the Assets prior to Closing. Holdings and its Subsidiaries will be
responsible for satisfying any deductibles, self-insured portions, retentions
and other retained amounts on insurance coverage with respect to losses
arising under claims made under the Transferred Policies to the
extent relating to Assumed Liabilities and Sellers shall be responsible for
any such deductibles, self-insured portions, retentions and other retained
amounts on insurance coverage with respect to any such losses arising under
the Transferred Policies to the extent relating to Retained Liabilities and
under all policies that are Retained Assets.

  

### 

  

## 10.11 _Exclusivity_. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates will, nor
will they permit or cause their respective officers, directors, agents or
employees to, solicit, initiate, encourage, discuss, negotiate or enter into
any arrangements relating to, any possible sale or other disposition of all
or any material part of the Assets or of the Business other than the sale of
Inventory in the ordinary course of business or other sales or dispositions
permitted by this Agreement (whether by merger,
reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) with any party other than
Holdings and its Affiliates (a "Company Takeover Proposal"), or provide any
information to any other party regarding the Business other than information
which is traditionally provided in the regular course of its business
operations to third parties where Parent and its officers, directors,
employees, and agents have no reason to believe that such information may be
utilized to evaluate a Company Takeover Proposal. Parent and its officers,
directors, employees, agents and Affiliates (i) do not have any agreement,
arrangement, or understanding with any third party with respect to any
Company Takeover Proposal (other than confidentiality agreements), (ii) will
cease and cause to be terminated any and all discussions with third parties
regarding any Company Takeover Proposal, and (iii) will promptly
notify Holdings if any Company Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or contact
with or by any Person or entity with respect thereto, is made (including the
identity of the proposing Person and the terms of such proposal).

  

## 

  

If within 30 days after the date hereof Parent receives, without
any solicitation thereof which is made after the date hereof, a Company
Takeover Proposal that constitutes a Company Superior Proposal (as defined
below), then in such event Parent shall notify Holdings that it has received
a Company Superior Proposal that Parents Board of Directors is prepared to
accept and shall provide Holdings with a description of all material terms of
the Company Takeover Proposal and the identity of the party making such
offer. Holdings may, at any time during the five business days after delivery
of such notice, at its option, submit a counter-proposal providing for the
delivery of aggregate consideration for the Business (valuing Timber Notes
for such purpose at their face value) that is at least equal to the aggregate
consideration to be paid for the Business under the Company Superior Proposal
(as reduced to take into account the effect of the break-up fee that would be
payable under Section 14.3.1 hereof) (a "Matching Offer"). If Parent delivers
such a notice of a Company Superior Proposal and after five business days
from delivery of such notice Holdings has not submitted a Matching Offer to
Parent, then either Parent or Holdings may terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 14.2.5 hereof with the effect specified therein and in Section
14.3.1 hereof. A "Company Superior Proposal" means a Company Takeover
Proposal that provides for cash consideration to be paid at closing for the
Business that is at least $250,000,000 higher than the aggregate
consideration (without reduction

  



  

52      
   



  

for the amount of the Reinvestment or the break-up fee payable under Section
14.3.1 hereof, and valuing Timber Notes for such purpose at their face value)
to be paid for the Business under this Agreement, and contains terms
and conditions that Parents Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and taking into account all relevant material terms of
such Company Takeover Proposal and this Agreement, are more favorable to the
shareholders of Parent than the transactions provided for herein, and as to
which Parents Board of Directors reasonably determines that rejection of
such Company Takeover Proposal would constitute a violation by the Board of
Directors of its fiduciary duties as directors of Parent under applicable
laws.

  



  

## 10.12 _Noncompetition_ From and after the Closing:

  



  

### 10.12.1 _Noncompetition_. In consideration of the mutual covenants
provided for herein, during the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Noncompete
Period"), Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly
or indirectly (i) engage in any business that competes with all or any
portion of the Business (as conducted as of Closing), anywhere within the
United States, or (ii) induce or attempt to induce any customer or other
business relation of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate or
reduce such relationship with Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries; provided
that Parent and its Affiliates shall not be deemed to be competing
in violation of this Section 10.12 by virtue of its or their (w) equity
interest relating to the Reinvestment, (x) ownership of less than 5% of the
outstanding stock of any publicly-traded corporation, (y) acquisition of any
Person (whether by asset purchase, stock purchase, merger or otherwise)
engaged in a business that competes with the Business if such businesses are
not such target Persons primary business and, on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to such acquisition, the aggregate sales attributable to the
business(es) competitive with the Business represent less than 3% of
aggregate consolidated pro forma revenues of Parent, its Subsidiaries and
such Person, or (z) ordinary course business operation of Boise Office
Solutions substantially in the manner operated as of the date of this
Agreement. This Section 10.12 shall not apply to any entity which might
acquire Parent or any assets or division of Parent, subject to the terms of
the Shareholder Agreements.

  

### 

  

### 10.12.2 _Severability_. The parties hereto agree that the covenant set
forth in Section 10.12.1 is reasonable with respect to its duration,
geographical area and scope. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of Section 10.12.1 is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to
reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as
so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be
appealed.

  

###

Sellers hereby consent to such transfer so long as it conforms to the
following terms and conditions (and, in such case, Parent and Southern will
absolutely, unconditionally, and irrevocably release Timber Co. from the
Purchaser Payment Performance Obligations):

  

## 

  

### 10.15.1 Such assignment shall be in writing and a copy thereof shall have
been provided to Parent prior to Closing. It shall provide that Timber LLC
shall assume and agree to the due and punctual performance of the terms and
conditions, undertakings, covenants and obligations of Timber Co. hereunder

### 

  

### 10.15.2 Subsequent to the assignment provided for in Section 10.15.1 and
at or before Closing: (i) Timber LLC will direct Parent and Southern to
convey the Timberlands to Timber Co. upon Closing; and (ii) Timber Co. will
absolutely, unconditionally, and irrevocably assume the due and punctual
performance of the terms, conditions, undertakings, covenants,
and obligations assumed and to be performed or observed by Timber LLC under
this Agreement and under applicable law in respect of the sale of the
Timberlands (and will assume all rights and benefits relating to the
Timberlands under this Agreement and any other agreements and under
applicable laws), excepting only Timber LLCs obligations under the Timber
Notes and the other documents provided for in the LC Commitment Letters, or
any other liability with respect to the payment of the Timberlands Purchase
Price (such excepted obligations of performance by Timber LLC hereinafter
referred to as "Purchaser Payment Performance Obligations"). At
Closing, Parent and Southern will convey the Timberlands to Timber Co. in
accordance with Timber LLCs direction, and Parent and Southern will
absolutely, unconditionally, and irrevocably release Timber LLC from all of
the terms, conditions, understandings, comments and obligations under this
Agreement and under applicable law other than the Purchaser Payment
Performance Obligations.

  

### 

  

### 10.15.3 Timber Co. and Timber LLC shall covenant in the assignment
document and for the express benefit of Sellers that during the term of the
Timber Notes:

  

### 

  

#### 10.15.3.1 without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent, in
the case of amendments that would not have an adverse effect on Sellers will
not be unreasonably withheld, and otherwise may be withheld by Seller in its
sole discretion), neither Timber Co. nor the manager of the Timber LLC shall
make any modification or amendment to, or grant any waiver under, Timber
LLCs operating agreement or cause or permit any interest in Timber LLC to be
issued to any person other than Timber Co.;

  



  

#### 10.15.3.2 without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), Timber Co.
shall not sell, assign or transfer all or any portion of its interest in
Timber LLC to any Person nor shall the manager of the Timber LLC resign;

  



  

#### 10.15.3.3 without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent may
be withheld by Parent in its sole discretion), neither Timber Co. nor the
manager of Timber LLC

  



  

56      
   



  

shall make any election that would cause Timber LLC to be treated as an
association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes; and

  

#### 

  

#### 10.15.3.4 without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent may
be withheld by Parent in its sole discretion) neither Timber Co. nor the
manager of the Timber LLC shall cause or permit Timber LLC to engage in any
activities prohibited by the terms of Timber LLCs operating agreement, or
cause or permit Timber LLC to engage in any activities inconsistent with the
purposes of Timber LLC as provided in Timber LLCs operating agreement;

  

#### 

  

 _provided_ , however, that the foregoing shall only be applicable to Timber
Co. prior to the transfer of Timber Co.s interest in Timber LLC and to the
manager of the Timber LLC prior to resignation of the manager of Timber LLC,
in each case in compliance with the provisions of this Subsection 10.15.3.
Timber Co.s right to transfer its membership interest in Timber LLC and the
managers right to resign (if the member to which Timber Co. transfers its
interest determines to replace the manager) shall be subject to the
additional condition that Timber Co. has obtained agreement of its transferee
and of the replacement manager (if there shall be one) (in each case,
expressly stated to be for the benefit of and enforceable by Parent) to be
bound by the provisions of the assignment of Timber Co.s Interest as if such
transferee were Timber Co. and the replacement manager were the manager named
therein (including the specific restrictions contained in Sections 10.15.3.1
through 10.15.3.4 above).

  



  

## 10.16 _Cooperation Concerning Timber Notes_. Holdings and Timber Co.
acknowledge that Parent and Southern desire to obtain installment sale
treatment for federal and state income Tax purposes on the sale of the
Timberlands (to the extent of the Timber Notes) and obtain the credit
enhancement of the Timber Notes provided for in the arrangements called for
in the LC Commitment Letters. The parties agree to work cooperatively to
complete the arrangements described in the LC Commitment Letters on a basis
which is reasonably acceptable to both parties in an effort to satisfy the
objectives of Parent and Southern described in the preceding sentence.

  



  

# ** _Article 11_** **_Employees_**

  



  

## 11.1 _Termination of Employees_. As of 11:59 p.m., Mountain standard
time, on the day immediately preceding Closing, Parent shall terminate its
employment of all of the Employees except for Employees employed by the
Transferred Subsidiaries. With respect to each Employee terminated by Parent,
Parent shall be responsible for payment when due of all salaries, wages,
commissions and bonuses and other incentive compensation (including without
limitation, a pro-rata payment under each incentive plan (determined in good
faith) with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date) and any amounts due
or to become due under the 2004 Retention Bonus Plan. Parent shall reimburse
the Employees for all travel expenses and other business-related expenses

employment as of the Closing Date unless such Employee declines such offer.
Such offer shall be at a wage rate and on other terms and conditions which
(i) in respect of Employees whose employment is governed by a collective
bargaining agreement, is in accordance with the requirements of such
agreement, and (ii) in respect of all other Employees, provides for base
salaries, base wages and commission, and cash bonus opportunity, which in the
aggregate are substantially comparable to those in effect for each such
Employee under its employment with Parent immediately prior to the Closing
Date. Holdings will provide incentive compensation for management via equity-
based awards and/or equity investment opportunities.  Holdings shall not be
obligated to pay severance to any Employee who rejects Holdings offer of
employment.  All Employees who accept employment with Holdings on the Closing
Date shall commence such employment as of immediately after their termination
by Parent so that there is no gap in their employment or in their health
and welfare benefit plan coverage. All Employees who accept employment with
Holdings pursuant to this Section 11.2 shall be referred to herein as
"Transferred Employees." The parties acknowledge that Holdings may cause one
or more of its Subsidiaries to satisfy its obligations under this Article 11,
including the obligation to offer employment to and hire the Transferred
Employees.

  

## 

  

## Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in connection with
any offer of employment to an Employee who is party to a 2004 Severance
Agreement, Holdings may include as part of such offer that such Employee will
enter into a severance agreement or arrangement with terms and conditions
(other than with respect to the aggregate amount of severance benefits)
different than the 2004 Severance Agreement, so long as Holdings offers such
Employee an alternative offer (which may contain lesser compensation and
benefits) that includes the 2004 Severance Agreement. With respect to any
Transferred Employee who is party to a 2004 Severance Agreement,
Parent agrees at Holdings request to take all such actions and enter into
such agreements as may be necessary for Parent to assign to Holdings all of
the rights and benefits applicable to Parent (including covenants from
such Transferred Employee) under such 2004 Severance Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 11.3 _Health and Welfare Benefit Plans_.

  

## 

  

### 11.3.1 Parent shall remain solely responsible in accordance with its
employee health and welfare benefit plans, programs, and policies for the
satisfaction of all claims regardless of when filed (subject to claim filing
requirements of such plans) for (i) medical, dental and vision benefits
claims which relate to services provided to Employees (and their covered
dependents) prior to Closing, and (ii) life insurance, accident or disability
benefits (other than workers compensation benefits) claims which relate to
events or injuries incurred prior to Closing.

  

### 

  

### 11.3.2 Except as otherwise provided under the Mutual Administrative
Services Agreement, Holdings shall establish, effective as of the Closing
Date, health and welfare benefit plans for the Transferred Employees which
(i) in respect of unionized Transferred Employees, meet the requirements of
applicable collective bargaining agreements, and (ii) in respect of all other
Transferred Employees, provide health and welfare benefits which in the
aggregate are substantially comparable (taking into account premium
participation, co-payment, deductibles,

  



  

58      
   



  

### amount of coverage and other material terms) to the benefits currently
provided by Parent which are listed on Schedule 7.9.2(a) of Parents
Disclosure Memorandum. Transferred Employees shall be enrolled in such plans
as of the beginning of their employment by Holdings without waiting period or
other initial limitation of coverage (except as applied under Parent Plans).
Holdings shall not terminate or make materially adverse reductions in
coverage or Employee increases in cost of participation for a period of two
years after Closing. Holdings new health and welfare benefits shall include
transition provisions coordinating the transfer of Transferred Employees from
Parents benefits to Holdings benefits without duplication of
annual deductibles and other yearly calculations.  Employees (and covered
dependents) who are hospitalized as of the Closing will remain on Parents
medical coverage until discharged from the hospital, at which time they will
be eligible to enroll under Holdings medical plan. Employees who are on
long-term disability as of the Closing, and Employees who first become
eligible for long-term disability benefits after the Closing because they
remain disabled from the Closing Date through the end of an applicable
elimination or waiting period, will remain on Parents long-term disability
coverages unless they return to active employment with Holdings.  Parent
shall transfer to Holdings its contract with the service provider for its
flexible spending accounts for Transferred Employees (or provide
a replacement contract on the same terms limited in scope to the
Transferred Employees) and assets equal to Transferred Employees account
balances as of the date of transfer, and Holdings shall maintain
substantially comparable flexible spending plans for at least two years after
the date of Closing. Holdings flexible spending account plan shall reimburse
Transferred Employees for eligible medical and dependent care expenses
incurred by such Transferred Employees (and their covered dependents) in 2004
(other than expenses that have been reimbursed prior to such transfer).

  

### 

  

### 11.3.3 Parent will provide eligibility for coverage and will be solely
responsible for complying with all employer responsibilities under provisions
of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ("COBRA") to Employees
(and their covered dependents) in respect of its termination of their
employment with Parent. Holdings will be solely responsible for complying
with all employer responsibilities under COBRA on and after the Closing Date
with respect to all Transferred Employees (and their covered dependents).

  

### 

  

## 11.4 _Pension Plans_.

  

## 

  

### 11.4.1 On or after July 31, 2004, but no later than the Closing Date,
Parent shall spin off (within the meaning of Section 1.414(l)-1(n) of the
Treasury Regulations) from each of the Pension Plans that portion of each
plan attributable to Employees who shall be identified as of the date of the
spinoff (collectively, the "Spunoff Pension Plans"). Each of the Spunoff
Pension Plans will be a mirror plan of each respective Pension Plan in all
material respects and Parent will not amend the Spunoff Pension Plans except
as required under applicable law or as necessary to accomplish the spinoff
and transfer under this Section 11.4.  Assets assigned to the Spunoff Pension
Plans shall be in the form of cash or marketable securities that are
acceptable to Holdings, provided that such acceptance shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

### 

  

### 11.4.2 Parent agrees to transfer to Holding on the Closing Date Spunoff
Pension Plans that are each fully funded on an Accumulated Benefit Obligation
basis as described below.

  



  

59      
   



  

#### 11.4.2.1 On the Closing Date, Parent shall make a contribution to each
Spunoff Pension Plan. The amount of the contribution shall be determined as
follows: Parent will provide data to Parents actuary that is complete and
accurate upon which Parents actuarys calculations will be based.  Parent
shall cause Parents actuary to calculate the Accumulated Benefit Obligation
for each Spunoff Pension Plan (determined as of the Closing Date
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) using
a discount rate equal to 6.25%, and all other actuarial assumptions,
procedures, processes and methods (disregarding changes in procedures and
processes under Parents actuarys valuation software that also apply on a
consistent basis to Parents actuarys other clients) used in the preparation
of the January 1, 2003 Milliman USA Actuarial Valuation Report for each
respective Pension Plan and participant data as of the date of the spinoff
(recognizing service, age, salary and benefit multipliers for benefit accrual
purposes through the Closing Date (but not taking into account new hires,
deaths, disabilities, terminations or other such changes in participant data
that occur after the date of the spinoff and on or prior to the Closing Date)
if the spinoff happens prior to Closing) (the "ABO"). The market value of
plan assets shall be determined as of the day prior to the Closing Date
for each respective Spunoff Pension Plan and subtracted from the ABO for each
respective Spunoff Pension Plan, and Parent shall contribute the resulting
amount to each respective Spunoff Pension Plan. The contribution shall be
made in the form of cash or marketable securities that are acceptable to
Holdings, provided that such acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

#### 

  

#### 11.4.2.2 Immediately after the contributions determined under Section
11.4.2.1 are made, Parent shall assign to Holdings, and Holdings shall assume
from Parent, the sponsorship of the Spunoff Pension Plans. Parent shall take
all actions necessary to satisfy requests of the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation with respect to such spinoff and transfer, including without
limitation, the posting of bonds or collateral.

  

#### 

  

#### 11.4.2.3 Parent shall cause Parents actuary to determine and certify in
writing to Holdings in form and substance satisfactory to Parent and
Holdings, on or prior to the Closing Date, that (i) the spinoff under Section
11.4.2.1 complies with Code Section 414(l), (ii) that the ABO that was
calculated for each respective Spunoff Pension Plan under Section 11.4.2.1
was calculated in accordance with Section 11.4.2.1 and (iii) each
participants accrued benefit used in the determination of the ABO was
calculated in accordance with the terms of each respective Spunoff Pension
Plan based on the participant data provided to such actuary by Parent. Not
later than 30 days prior to Closing, Parent (or Parents actuary) shall
provide to Holdings actuary all information necessary to calculate the
accrued benefit for each Employee included in the calculation and all
demographic information pertaining to the calculation. Not later than
15 days prior to Closing, Parent (or Parents actuary) shall provide to
Holdings actuary all information necessary to verify such calculations,
including without limitation, the accrued benefit and ABO for each Employee
included in the calculation and all demographic information pertaining to the
calculation.

  

#### 

  

### 11.4.3 At Closing Parent shall fully vest and freeze the benefits accrued
to date by participating Transferred Employees under the Boise Cascade
Corporation Supplemental Pension Plan and it shall pay such frozen benefits
to affected Transferred Employees when and as they may become due under such
plan. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall amend the Boise Cascade Corporation
Supplemental Early Retirement Plan for Executive Officers to provide (i)

  



  

60      
   



  

### for the recognition of service for Transferred Employees with Holdings
and its Affiliates after the Closing Date for the purpose of meeting vesting
and eligibility requirements and (ii) that to the extent that any
Transferred Employee participating under such plan as of the Closing Date
retires from Holdings and its Affiliates after reaching age 55 with 10 or
more years of service and 5 or more years of service as an executive officer
(taking into account service with Parent and its Affiliates prior to the
Closing Date and service with Holdings and its Affiliates on and after the
Closing Date), such plan will provide a benefit to such Transferred Employee
as if he or she had met all applicable age and service requirements as of the
Closing. Holdings shall create plans that in the aggregate are substantially
comparable to the Unfunded Pension Plans for the affected Employees, which
shall be maintained without material change at least two years after Closing.
Holdings shall provide participants in the Unfunded Pension Plans with a past
service credit reflecting their past service with Parent and it shall be
entitled to an offset for benefits earned under such plans equal to the
participating Transferred Employees frozen benefit under Parents plan.

  



  

### 11.4.4 Holdings will maintain the Spunoff Pension Plans and Holdings
replacement unfunded pension plans without any material and adverse (to the
Transferred Employees) change for two years after Closing.

  



  

## 11.5 _Defined Contribution Retirement Plans_.

  



  

### 11.5.1 Effective as of the Closing Date or as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter, Holdings shall establish one or more defined
contribution retirement plans (collectively, the "Holdings DC Plans") which
will provide each of the Transferred Employees for a period of at least two
years matching contribution percentages that in the aggregate are
substantially comparable to that available to such Transferred Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date under the Defined Contribution Plans,
provided that Holdings shall not be required to establish an Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (an "ESOP") and provided further that Holdings shall not be
required to maintain a Parent common stock account. Except as not permitted
by a trustee or recordkeeper of any Holdings DC Plan, Holdings will
provide Transferred Employees with an opportunity to transfer any Parent
common stock they hold in the Defined Contribution Plans (not relating to the
ESOP accounts) into a qualified plan account that accepts such Parent common
stock.

  

### 

  

### 11.5.2 Each of the Transferred Employees shall receive credit for
eligibility and vesting purposes under the Holdings DC Plans for all service
credited under the Defined Contribution Plans.

  

### 

  

### 11.5.3 As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event
later than 60 days after the Closing Date, all assets and liabilities of the
Defined Contribution Plans attributable to the Transferred Employees vested
and non-vested account balances shall be transferred (within the meaning of
Section 1.414(l)-1(o) of the Treasury Regulations) in the form of cash or
other marketable securities reasonably acceptable to Holdings, Parent common
stock not relating to the ESOP accounts (except as not permitted under
Section 11.5.1) and notes associated with plan loans to the Holdings DC
Plans. Parent agrees not to place any Transferred Employees plan loan into
default on or after the Closing Date and prior to the transfer of account
balances under this paragraph.

  



  

61      
   



  

## 11.6 _Incentive Compensation and Deferred Compensation Plans_. Holdings
will not be obligated to assume Parents deferred compensation and incentive
compensation plans.  Parent will discharge its obligations to Employees under
such plans in accordance with their terms and Section 11.1 hereof.

  

## 

  

## 11.7 _Vacation_. Holdings shall establish a vacation policy or policies
that in the aggregate are substantially comparable to Parents current
vacation policies in effect immediately prior to the date hereof
for Transferred Employees and are in compliance with applicable
collective bargaining agreements. Such policies shall recognize service
credit for all past service recognized for Transferred Employees under
Parents policies in effect on the date hereof. Except insofar as Parent is
required by applicable state law to compensate Transferred Employees in cash
upon termination of employment for earned and unused vacation, Holdings shall
assume the liability for such accrued and unused vacation to the extent
accrued as a Current Liability in the computation of Closing Net Working
Capital and discharge such liability in accordance with the terms of
Holdings established policies, provided that such policies shall not
unreasonably restrict the use of such accrued and unused vacation. To the
extent such a liability transfer is not permitted by applicable state law, no
liability assumption shall occur and Parent shall pay affected
Transferred Employees in cash for earned and unused vacation when and as
required by applicable state law.

  

## 

  

## 11.8 _Severance and Retention Obligations_. Parent will retain all
severance, change of control, retention and other similar obligations that
arise prior to the Closing or with respect to terminations of employment that
occur prior to the Closing Date or with respect to resignations by
Transferred Employees (whether prior to or after the Closing Date) for
"good reason" (within the meaning of the 2004 Severance Agreements) where
events forming the basis for the claim of "good reason" occurred prior to the
Closing Date (unless the event forming the basis for such claim of "good
reason" consists of the terms of employment offered by Holdings). Parent also
will retain (i) all employment, change of control, retention and similar
agreements (and obligations thereunder) other than temporary employment
contracts that are terminable without penalty at any time at the will of the
employer with a term of less than one year and at an annual compensation rate
of less than $75,000 and that provide for no payments of severance, (ii) all
payments, bonuses or other obligations to provide compensation or benefits as
a result of the occurrence of the transaction and (iii) all obligations to
provide retention payments to Employees, including officer and non-officer
Transferred Employees, pursuant to retention plans, policies or agreements in
existence as of the Closing Date (including, without limitation, the 2004
Retention Bonus Plan) regardless of whether such obligations are or become
payable prior to, on or after the Closing Date. After Closing, Holdings will
adopt a general severance policy that will be in the aggregate substantially
comparable to Section VII.A. of the Parents Termination of Employment
Corporate Policy Number 10.2, dated July 26, 2004 (which is attached hereto
as Schedule 11.8 in its currently applicable form and the form applicable on
and after such date) ("Holdings General Severance Policy"). Holdings will be
responsible for all severance costs under the Holdings General Severance
Policy with respect to Transferred Employees who are terminated by Holdings
after Closing and under the 2004 Severance Agreements `for any Transferred
Employees who are officers immediately prior to Closing and who are
terminated by Holdings after Closing. During the two year period after
Closing, for all terminations of Transferred Employees who are not officers
as of the Closing Date, Holdings shall provide severance benefits at a rate
no lower than the maximum severance rate (within the

  



  

62      
   



  

applicable severance range) which would have been applicable to such Employee
at the time of Closing under Section VII.A. of the Parents Termination of
Employment Corporate Policy Number 10.2, dated July 26, 2004.

  

## 

  

## 11.9 _Workers  Compensation_. Holdings shall assume all liabilities
arising from workers compensation claims, whether characterized as medical or
indemnity, or arising under any other similar government-mandated programs
which are based on injuries incurred by Employees or former employees in
connection with the Business, without regard to the date of occurrence of the
injury or injuries giving rise to the workers compensation claim. Holdings
shall have the right to submit claims under relevant workers compensation
insurance policies and related agreements maintained by Parent and its
affiliates prior to the Closing Date (each, a "Pre-Closing Workers
Compensation Policy") for claims brought by any current or former employee of
the Business arising out of an event occurring prior to the Closing Date to
the full limits of such Pre-Closing Workers Compensation Policy to the
extent covered by such Pre-Closing Workers Compensation Policy. With respect
to each Pre-Closing Workers Compensation Policy other than those which
are assigned to Holdings, Parent and its Affiliates shall (i) ensure such
policies are in full force and effect as of the Closing Date; (ii) not take
any action or inaction to amend or terminate such policies after the Closing
Date with respect to coverage for Holdings; and (iii) maintain any letter-of-
credit or security bonds needed to maintain any such policy. Holdings and
Parent shall cooperate fully with the relevant insurer in the defense of any
claim brought under any insurance policies pursuant to this Section 11.9.

  

## 

  

## 11.10 _Retiree Benefits_. Parent shall be liable for all liabilities and
obligations to provide coverage in connection with claims for benefits
brought by or in respect of former and retired employees of the Business (and
their covered dependents) who had terminated employment or retired prior to
Closing (including Employees who are eligible to retire as of the day prior
to Closing whose employment is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1) under any
of Parents retirement welfare benefit plans, including, but not limited to,
such liabilities with respect to medical, dental, life insurance, health,
accident or disability benefits, but excluding any claims for or relating to
workers compensation benefits for which Holdings is responsible under
Section 11.9 hereof.  Holdings will assume the obligation to provide retiree
welfare benefits to (i) active union Transferred Employees after their post-
Closing retirements (in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining
agreements), (ii) active non-union hourly Transferred Employees in Parents
Boise Building Solutions, Manufacturing Division after their post-Closing
retirements (with a 40% employer subsidy that may be reduced or eliminated in
the future)and (iii) active salaried Transferred Employees after their post-
Closing retirements (with the entire cost paid by such employees); provided,
however, that Holdings shall have the right (subject to applicable collective
bargaining agreements) to modify or terminate such benefits in the future.

  

## 

  

## 11.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiary_. This Agreement is being entered into
solely for the benefit of the parties hereto, and the parties do not intend
that any Employee or any other Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of
the covenants by either Parent or Holdings contained in this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 11.12 _Workers Adjustment and Retraining Act ("WARN")_.  Holdings shall
indemnify and hold Parent harmless from and against any and all liabilities,
claims and losses (including attorneys fees, court costs, and other
litigation expenses) arising under the Worker Adjustment

  



  

63      
   



  

and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 or any similar state or local law,
regulation or ordinance (collectively, the "WARN Act") by reason of Holdings
shutdown of any Facility or layoff of Employees which occurs after the
Closing. Parent shall indemnify and hold Holdings harmless from and against
any and all liabilities, claims and losses (including attorneys fees, court
costs, and other litigation expenses) arising under the WARN Act by reason of
the shutdown of any Facility or layoff of Employees which occurs or has
occurred prior to the Closing.

  

## 

  

## 11.13 _Non-solicitation of Employees_. For a period of two years
following the Closing, Parent and its Affiliates shall not directly
or indirectly solicit any Transferred Employee for employment without the
prior consent of Holdings. The foregoing shall not prohibit Parent from (i)
soliciting any Transferred Employee who has terminated his or her employment
with Holdings prior to such solicitation, or (ii) offering employment to any
Employee who approaches Parent without prior solicitation by Parent, whether
in response to a general advertisement by Parent, or otherwise.

  

## 

  

## 11.14 _Modifications to Benefits_. Subject to the two-year restrictions
on modification of compensation and benefits set forth in this Article 11 and
any other applicable restrictions under collective bargaining agreements,
Holdings may modify or terminate its compensation and benefit plans at any
time in its discretion; provided, however, that notwithstanding the various
two-year restrictions on modification of compensation and benefits set forth
in this Article 11, Holdings may initially adopt compensation and benefit
plans different from those provided by Sellers and may modify its
compensation and benefit plans during such two-year period following the
Closing, in either case so long as its compensation and benefit
plans (including equity arrangements), in the aggregate, are substantially
comparable to that provided to Transferred Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date or as otherwise consistent with changes under collective
bargaining agreements.

  



  

# ** _Article 12_** **_Tax Matters_**

  

# 

  

## 12.1 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

  

## 

  

### 12.1.1 (i) At Holdings option, Parent and Holdings (and/or its
designated Permitted Affiliate Purchaser(s)) shall jointly make Elections
(and any comparable election under state or local tax law) with regard to
each of the Transferred Subsidiaries for which such an election may be made;

  



  

(ii) Parent and Holdings shall, as promptly as practicable following the
Closing Date, cooperate with each other to take all actions necessary
and appropriate (including filing such forms, returns, elections, schedules
and other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve timely
Elections in accordance with the provisions of Treasury regulations
promulgated under Section 338 of the Code (or any comparable provisions of
state or local tax law) or any successor provisions;

  



  

(iii) Parent and Holdings shall report the purchase by Holdings of
the Transferred Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement consistent with
the Elections (and any comparable elections under state or local tax laws)
and shall take no position inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return, any
proceeding before any taxing authority or otherwise; and

  



  

64      
   



  

(iv) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Holdings or its Affiliates from
making an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to
the acquisition (or deemed acquisition) of the equity of each
Transferred Subsidiary organized under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction.

  



  

### 12.1.2 In connection with each Election, Holdings shall prepare, and
Parent shall agree to (which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld),
the determination of the "Aggregate Deemed Sales Price" (as defined under
Treasury regulation Section 1.338-4) and the allocation of each such
"Aggregate Deemed Sales Price" among the assets of each respective
Transferred Subsidiary, which shall be consistent with the Allocation
contemplated by Section 3.4 hereof. The determination of the amount of each
such "Aggregate Deemed Sales Price" and the allocation thereof shall be made
in accordance with Section 338(b) of the Code and applicable
Treasury regulations. Parent and Holdings shall (i) be bound by such
determination and such allocation for purposes of determining any Taxes, (ii)
prepare and file, and cause their affiliates to prepare and file, Tax Returns
on a basis consistent with each such determination of the "Aggregate Deemed
Sales Price" and each such allocation, and (iii) take no position, and cause
their affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with any such
determination or allocation on any applicable Tax Return in any proceeding
before any taxing authority or otherwise. In the event that any such
allocation and/or determination is disputed by any Tax Authority, the party
receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other party hereto
concerning resolution of the dispute.

  



  

## 12.2 _Tax Return Filing and Payment of Taxes Responsibility_.

  



  

### 12.2.1 Parent shall (i) prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, on a timely basis (in each case, at its sole cost and expense) all Tax
Returns with respect to the Transferred Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to
the Assets or the Business for all Tax Periods ending on or before the
Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Returns"), and (ii) pay, or cause to be paid,
all Taxes shown to be due on such Pre-Closing Returns.

  

### 

  

### 12.2.2 Holdings shall (i) prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, on a timely basis (in each case, at its sole cost and expense) all
other Tax Returns for all taxable periods ending after the Closing Date with
respect to the Transferred Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to the Assets
or to the Business, including Straddle Period Returns, and (ii) pay, or cause
to be paid, all Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns.

  



  

### 12.2.3 In connection with any Straddle Period Return, Parent shall be
liable for and shall pay, or cause to be paid, any Taxes for which Parent has
agreed to indemnify Holdings pursuant to Section 12.4 hereof. Holdings shall

(20) days prior to the due date thereof (giving effect to any extensions
thereto), accompanied by a statement calculating in reasonable detail the
Parent indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 12.4 hereof (the "Tax
Indemnification Obligation"). Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Holdings the amount of the Tax Indemnification Obligation within ten (10)
days of receiving copies of the Straddle Period Returns (the "Parent
Preliminary Tax Payment"). If Parent objects to the determination of the Tax
Indemnification Obligation, Holdings and Parent shall use reasonable efforts
to resolve such dispute, but if a __ final resolution is not obtained within
fifteen (15) days, the dispute shall be

  



  

65      
   



  

submitted to the Independent Accountants with instructions that such
Independent Accountants render a determination with respect to the dispute
within thirty (30) days. The determination of the Independent Accountants
shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties in the manner and to the
same effect as a binding arbitration award. All costs and expenses incurred
relating to the engagement of the Independent Accountants shall be shared
equally by Parent and Holdings. If the Tax Indemnification Obligation,
as finally determined, exceeds the amount of the Parent Preliminary Tax
Payment, Parent shall promptly pay, or cause to be paid, the amount of such
excess to Holdings. If the Tax Indemnification Obligation, as finally
determined, is less than the amount of the Parent Preliminary Tax Payment,
Holdings shall promptly refund the amount of such deficiency to Parent.

  

### 

  

### 12.2.4 Parent and Holdings shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause
their respective affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives to reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns (including amended returns and claims for refund), including the
issuance of a power of attorney and maintaining and making available to each
other all records necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving all
disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes.

  

### 

  

## 12.3 _Transfer and Similar Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, all fees, sales (including, without
limitation, bulk sales), use, transfer, gains, stamp, duties, value-added,
recording and similar Taxes ("Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne equally by
Holdings and/or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent and its
Retained Subsidiaries, on the other hand.  The party charged by law with the
duty of making the necessary filings and returns with respect to such
Transfer Taxes shall do so in accordance with applicable law, and shall be
entitled to reimbursement from the other party to the extent that such party,
in connection with such filings, pays an amount in excess of what it is
required to pay hereunder.

  

## 

  

## 12.4 _Tax Indemnification_.

  

## 

  

### 12.4.1 Parent shall indemnify Holdings and its Affiliates and hold them
harmless from and against (i) any Taxes of Sellers and its Affiliates (other
than Taxes described in Section 12.4.2), (ii) any liability for Taxes of the
Transferred Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to the Assets or Business for
all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and for the Pre-
Closing Period, (iii) any liability for Taxes which result from (A) the
deemed sale of assets pursuant to the Elections or any election under Section
338(g) of the Code, and (B) the deemed sale of assets pursuant to any
comparable elections under state or local tax laws, (iv) any liability for
Taxes imposed upon any of the Transferred Subsidiaries pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or similar provision under any state, local or
foreign Tax law) as a result of being a member of an affiliated group, within
the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code (or similar provision under any
state, local or foreign Tax law), prior to the Closing, and any liability for
Taxes imposed on any of the Transferred Subsidiaries as a transferee or
successor (where such Transferred Subsidiary became a transferee or successor
before the Closing) or by contract (where such contract was entered into
prior to the Closing), and (v) any Loss attributable to any breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 7.8.

  



  

66      
   



  

### 12.4.2 Holdings shall indemnify Parent and its affiliates and hold them
harmless from and against (i) any liability for Taxes of the Transferred
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to the Assets or Business for any taxable
period ending after the Closing Date (except to the extent such taxable
period began before the Closing Date, in which case Holdings indemnity will
cover only that portion of any such Taxes that is not attributable to the
Pre-Closing Period), and (ii) any liability for sales and use Taxes, value
added Taxes, and real and personal property Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing

Parent within five (5) business days after Holdings, any of its Affiliates or
either of the Transferred Subsidiaries receives such refund or utilizes such
credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be entitled to the

from, against and in respect and to the extent of any damages, claims,

facts or conditions or transactions (or series of facts, conditions or
transactions) existing at or prior to the Closing related to the Business,
other than the Assumed Liabilities specified in items 5.1.1 through 5.1.6 of
Section 5.1.

  



  

## 17.3 _Sellers Liability Limits_.

  



  

### 17.3.1 Sellers shall not be liable to the Holdings Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Section 17.2.1 for any Losses arising as a result of any breach
of any representation or warranty except to the extent (and then only to the
extent) the aggregate of such Losses (when added to the aggregate Losses
under Section 17.2.4, whether or not in excess of the Environmental
Deductible) exceeds the Deductible, and then only for all such Losses in
excess thereof up to an aggregate amount (when added to the aggregate Losses
under Section 17.2.4, whether or not in excess of the Environmental
Deductible) equal to the Cap; _provided_ that neither the Cap nor the
Deductible shall apply to any breach of any representation or warranty of
Sellers made in any of _Sections 7.1_ through _7.5_  hereof, _Section 7.16.1_
, _Section 7.16.2,_ _Section 7.16.3_ , _Section 7.16.5_ , _Section 7.16.6_ ,
or _Section 7.17_.

  



  

### 17.3.2 Sellers shall not be liable to the Holdings Indemnified Parties

added to the aggregate Losses under Section 17.2.1) equal to the Cap.

  



  

### 17.3.3 The Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to Losses suffered by
the Holdings Indemnified Parties from a breach by Sellers or any of their
Subsidiaries of any of its covenants hereunder, its obligations hereunder in
respect of the Retained Liabilities, or its obligations under Section 17.2.5.
Claims made by any Holdings Indemnified Party against any of the Sellers for
breach of any representation or warranty contained in any Deed given pursuant
to this Agreement shall likewise not be subject to the operation of the
Deductible and the Cap.

  

### 

  

## 17.4 _Holdings Indemnity_. Holdings shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Parent and each of its Retained Subsidiaries and their respective
directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members, agents and employees
and their heirs, successors and assigns (the "Parent Indemnified Parties")

indirectly caused by or relating to (i) any breach by Holdings of any of

Liabilities.

  



  

77      
   



  

## 17.6 _Indemnification Procedures_.

  



  

### 17.6.1 Any Person making a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
17.2 or 17.4 above (an "Indemnified Party") must give the party from whom
indemnification is sought (an "Indemnifying Party") written notice of such
claim describing such claim with reasonable particularity and the nature and
amount of such Loss to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss is
known at such time) (an "Indemnification Claim Notice") promptly after the
Indemnified Party receives any written notice of any action, lawsuit,
proceeding, investigation or other claim (a "Proceeding") against or
involving the Indemnified Party by a Governmental Authority or other third
party or otherwise discovers the liability, obligations or facts giving rise
to such claim for indemnification; provided that, the failure to notify or
delay in notifying an Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations pursuant to Section 17.2 or 17.4, as applicable,
except to the extent that (and only to the extent that) such failure shall
have caused the damages for which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to be
greater than such damages would have been had the Indemnified Party given the
Indemnifying Party prompt notice hereunder.

  

### 

  

### 17.6.2 The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from the personal
delivery or mailing of the Indemnification Claim Notice (the "Notice Period")
to notify the Indemnified Party (i) whether or not the Indemnifying Party
disputes the liability of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
hereunder with respect to such claim or demand, and (ii) whether or not it
desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand.

  

### 

  

### 17.6.3 If (i) the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to be responsible
for the full amount of such Loss, and (ii) the claim for indemnification does
not relate to a matter (A) that, if determined adversely, could reasonably be
expected to expose the Indemnified Party to criminal prosecution or
penalties, (B) that, if determined adversely, could reasonably be expected to
result in the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree which would
restrict the activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any Affiliate
thereof, or (C) for which the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably
concluded, in good faith, after consultation with the Indemnifying Party,
that such representation is likely to result in a conflict of interest or
materially jeopardize the viability of such defense, then the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate
proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense.
If any Indemnified Party desires to participate in any such defense, it may
do so at its sole cost and expense.

  

### 

  

The Indemnifying Party in no event shall have any right to control
(as opposed to participate in pursuant to Section 17.6.4 hereof) the defense
of any claim and shall pay the expenses of the Indemnified Partys defense of
such claim if:

  



  

#### 17.6.3.1 the Indemnifying Party does not agree in writing to be
responsible for the full amount of any claim;

  



  

#### 17.6.3.2 the claim for indemnification relates to a matter (A) that, if
determined adversely, could reasonably be expected to expose the Indemnified
Party to criminal prosecution or penalties, (B) that, if determined
adversely, could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of a
consent order, injunction or decree which would restrict the activity or
conduct of the Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof, or (C) for which
the Indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded, in good faith, after
consultation with the Indemnifying Party,

  



  

78      
   



  

that such representation is likely to result in a conflict of interest or
materially jeopardize the viability of such defense; or

  



  

#### 17.6.3.3 a court determines that the Indemnifying Party is not
vigorously defending the claim.

  



  

### 17.6.4 If the claim relates to a matter for which both the Indemnifying
Party and any Indemnified Party could be liable or responsible hereunder,
such as a Loss for which both parties could be partially liable due to the
Cap and Deductible, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties shall
cooperate in good faith in the defense of such action. No party shall settle
any claim without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that an Indemnified Party
shall not be required to consent to any settlement if the proposed settlement
(i) does not provide for a full release of all claims against such
Indemnified Party, (ii) is on a basis which would result in the imposition of
a consent order, injunction or decree or any other restriction on the
activity or conduct of such Indemnified Party, or (iii) is on a basis
which could, in such Indemnified Partys judgment, expose such Indemnified
Party to criminal liability or require an admission of wrongdoing by such
Indemnified Party; provided further that, the foregoing notwithstanding, an
Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim without the prior
consent of the Indemnifying Party if under Section 17.6.3 the Indemnifying
Party had no right to control the defense of such claim.  If an Indemnified
Party does not consent to a definitive settlement proposed by the
Indemnifying Party (with respect to which a settlement agreement has been
agreed to by all parties other than the Indemnified Party) which settlement
satisfies the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) or if the Indemnifying
Party does not consent to a settlement proposed by an Indemnified Party, then
the party declining such settlement shall thereafter have full control of the
defense of such claim, and the maximum liability of the party that proposed
such settlement shall be determined as though such matter had settled on the
terms so proposed, and, if applicable, the amount of the proposed settlement,
together with all legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with such
matter through and including the proposed settlement date, shall be deemed
the amount of the Loss of the Indemnified Party for purposes of determining
whether the Cap and Deductible have been met. If both parties agree to the
settlement, the relative liabilities of the parties for such Losses shall be
determined as provided in the other provisions of this Article 17.

  



  

### 17.6.5 All costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in
defending a claim or demand under Section 17.6.3, and all costs and expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending a claim or demand which the
Indemnifying Party has elected not to defend (including by virtue of its
failure to give timely notice to the Indemnified Party) or is not permitted
to defend under Section 17.6.3 shall be a liability of, and shall be paid by,
the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

### 17.6.6 To the extent the Indemnifying Party shall direct, control or
participate in the defense or settlement of any third-party claim or demand,
the Indemnified Party will give the Indemnifying Party and its counsel access
to, during normal business hours, the relevant business records and other
documents, and shall permit them to consult with the employees and counsel of
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Parties shall
use their best efforts in the defense of all such claims.

  



  

79      
   



  

## 17.7 _Acknowledgement Regarding Liabilities_. Holdings and Sellers
acknowledge the allocation of relative responsibility for liabilities under
this Agreement is a material term of this Agreement, and that they have taken
such matters into consideration in determining the financial and other terms
of this transaction. Accordingly, the parties agree that a party shall be
entitled to the indemnification or other remedies provided in this Agreement
by reason of any breach of any such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement by another party notwithstanding whether such party or any
employee, representative or agent of such party seeking to enforce a remedy
knew or had reason to know of such breach. Furthermore, for all purposes of
indemnification under this Article 17, determinations of whether
a representation or warranty has been breached and of the amount of
Losses arising from any such breach shall be made without giving effect to
any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or Knowledge qualifications
contained in such representation or warranty.

  

## 

  

## 17.8 _Computation of Losses Subject to Indemnification_.  The amount of
any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article 17 shall be
computed net of any insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified
Party in connection with such Loss. Indemnification for any Loss shall be
determined and paid without reduction for any Tax Benefits not yet realized
by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will pay to the Indemnifying
Party the amount of any Tax Benefits attributable to the Loss actually
realized by the Indemnified Party promptly after such Tax Benefits
are realized; provided, however, that in the event such Tax Benefits are
realized prior to the indemnification payment hereunder, such indemnification
payment shall be reduced by Tax Benefits previously realized in lieu of a
separate payment to the Indemnifying Party. The amount of any Tax Benefit
shall be determined (i) by comparing the liability of the Indemnified Party
for Taxes, determined without the Loss and any corresponding indemnification
payments, to the liability of the Indemnified Party for Taxes, taking into
account the Loss and any corresponding indemnification payments, and (ii) by
treating any items attributable to the Loss as the last items claimed by the
Indemnified Party in any given Tax Period. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this Article 17 shall exclude consequential
damages (it being understood that a reduction in the value of the Business or
the Assets shall not be considered consequential damages) and punitive
damages by an Indemnified Party; provided that, any consequential damages and
punitive damages of a third party for which an Indemnified Party is liable
shall be included in computing such Indemnified Partys Loss.

  

## 

  

## 17.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Each party acknowledges that, except as set
forth in Article 12 and Section 19.16, from and after the Closing this
Article 17 constitutes the sole remedy of any party with respect to any
matter arising hereunder (other than with respect to claims based on fraud),
including any Losses or liability under any Environmental Law or with respect
to any Hazardous Substances (including claims under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
("CERCLA")) and expressly waives any other rights or causes of action,
including under any Environmental Law (including CERCLA) or with respect to
any claim involving the presence of or exposure to any Hazardous Substances.

  

## 

  

## 17.10 _Tax Indemnities Separate_. The Tax indemnifications extended by
the parties pursuant to Article 12 hereof shall be independent of the
indemnifications provided for in this Article 17, and no claim for Loss shall
be asserted under this Article 17 which is a matter which is governed by the
Tax indemnifications provided for in Article 12. Payments to be made

  



  

80      
   



  

pursuant to Article 12 shall not be subject to the Deductible and Cap
limitations contained in this Article 17 and shall not affect the calculation
of the satisfaction of such limits.

  



  

## 17.11 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. Indemnity payments made pursuant
to Article 17 or Article 12 shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment
to the Non-Timber Purchase Price or the Timberlands Purchase Price, as
applicable.

  



  

# ** _Article 18_** **_Transition Services; Amended Paper Sales Agreement_**

  

# 

  

## 18.1 At Closing, Parent and Holdings shall enter into a Mutual
Administrative Services Agreement in form and substance substantially similar
to the form attached as Schedule 18.1 (the "Mutual Administrative Services
Agreement").

  



  

## 18.2 At Closing Parent shall, and shall cause Boise Office Solutions to,
enter into an Amended Paper Sales Agreement in form and substance
substantially similar to the form attached as Schedule 18.2 (the "Amended
Paper Sales Agreement"), which agreement will amend and supersede the BOS
Paper Sales Agreement, and which agreement will be assigned to Holdings at
the Closing.

  



  

# ** _Article 19_** **_Notices_**

  

# 

  

## 19.1 _Notices_. All notices, demands and other communications given or

## 19.2 _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended
or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed,
in the case of an amendment, by Parent, on behalf of all Sellers, and
Holdings, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is
to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right,
power, or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege.  The rights
and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights or remedies provided by law.

  

## 

  

## 19.3 _Assignment_. Except as otherwise provided herein, no party to this
Agreement may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other party hereto (not to be
unreasonably withheld), except that a party may, without the consent of
any other party hereto, (a) collaterally assign its rights and obligations
under this Agreement to a lender as security for a loan to Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries, (b) Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries may assign its
rights, but not its obligations, hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates,
and (c) Holdings and its Subsidiaries may assign their rights under this
Agreement to one (but not more than one) purchaser in connection with any
sale of all or substantially all of the Business.

  

## 

  

## 19.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with all Schedules
hereto, and the parties respective Disclosure Memoranda, and the Ancillary
Agreements contain the entire agreement between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters, except for the
obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement and the
obligations of Madison Dearborn Partners, Inc., set forth in that certain
letter dated January 21, 2004, to Goldman, Sachs and Co. on behalf of Parent,
which obligations will remain in full force and effect; _provided_  that

  



  

82      
   



  

the obligations of Holdings and each of its Affiliates under the
Confidentiality Agreement and such letter shall terminate as of the Closing.

  

## 

  

## 19.5 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any party to any
other party under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, which
obligation is performed satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such party,
shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied, or fulfilled by such
party. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party agrees
that Holdings may cause performance of any of its obligations hereunder by
any one or more of its Subsidiaries and, to the extent that performance by
such Subsidiary(ies) satisfies the obligations of Holdings hereunder,
Holdings shall be deemed to have fully performed such obligation.

  

## 

  

## 19.6 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.  Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Person other than Sellers, Holdings, the
Permitted Affiliate Purchasers, the Indemnified Parties and their respective
successors or permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 19.7 _Public Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, except as may be required to comply with the requirement of any
applicable laws and the rules and regulations of each stock exchange upon
which the securities of one of the parties (or its Affiliate) is listed, no
press release or similar public announcement or communication shall, prior to
the Closing, be made or caused to be made concerning the execution
or performance of this Agreement unless specifically approved in advance by
all parties hereto. Holdings understands and acknowledges that Parent has
concluded that upon signing of this Agreement it will be legally obligated to
make a public disclosure of such fact and of the material terms of the
transaction and that it has reviewed and approved Parents proposed external
and internal information releases.

  

## 

  

## 19.8 _Expenses_ Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the
party incurring such expenses ; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of Holdings or one or more of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and Parent or one or more of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall
each pay 50% of the fees for filings required to be made with Governmental
Authorities, as described in Section 10.3.1.

  

## 

  

## 19.9 _Schedules_. The disclosure of any matter in any Schedule shall not
be deemed to constitute an admission by Parent or Holdings or otherwise imply
that any such matter is material for the purposes of this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 19.10 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Holdings acknowledges that Parent has not
taken, and does not intend to take, any action required to comply with any
applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer laws or similar laws; provided that,
Parent shall indemnify Holdings for any Losses arising from such non-
compliance. Such indemnification shall not be subject to the Deductible and
Cap provisions of Article 17.

  



  

83      
   



  

## 19.11 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum_.
This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the state of Delaware. Each party hereto agrees that it shall
bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the transaction contained in or contemplated by
this Agreement, whether in tort or contract or at law or in equity,
exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware
or any state court located in Delaware (the "Chosen Courts") and (i)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii)
waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the
Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an
inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party hereto, and
(iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or
proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section
19.1 of this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 19.12 _Counterparts_. This agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile), each of which shall be deemed
an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 19.13 _Headings_. The heading references herein are for convenience
purposes only, do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.

  

## 

  

## 19.14 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (i) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision; and (ii) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Person or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity unenforceability.

  

## 

  

## 19.15 _Business Day_. Any reference herein to a business day shall be any
day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any United States federal holiday.

  

## 

  

## 19.16 _Specific Performance_. The Sellers acknowledge that the Business
is unique and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by any of the Sellers, money damages may be inadequate and Holdings
and the Permitted Affiliate Purchasers may have no adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, the Sellers agree that Holdings shall have the right, in
addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to enforce
its rights and the obligations of the Sellers hereunder not only by an action
or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief. If any such action is
brought by Holdings or any of its Affiliates to enforce this Agreement, the
Sellers hereby waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law.

  

## 

  

## 19.17 _Independent Significance_. The parties intend that each
representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein shall
have independent significance. If any party has breached any representation,
warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there
exists another representation, warranty, or covenant relating to the same
subject matter

  



  

84      
   



  

(regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the party has not
breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the party is in
breach of the first representation, warranty, or covenant.

Agreements or disclosing such Confidential Information to any Person (other
than Holdings and its Affiliates), and (except as otherwise provided herein)
deliver promptly to Holdings, at the request and option of Holdings, all
tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the Confidential Information
which are in its or their possession or under its or their control. In the
event that Parent or any of its Affiliates is requested or required (by oral

disclosing Person shall use its best efforts to obtain an order or other
assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such portion of
the Confidential Information required to be disclosed as Holdings shall
designate.
