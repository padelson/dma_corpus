to, and will not, rely on, any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to the Boyd Parties, the Companies or any of their
respective businesses or operations or any other matter, including with
respect to the accuracy or completeness of any information provided, disclosed
or delivered to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to the extent such
information is not covered by an Express Representation in connection with the
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. In connection with the due diligence investigation of the
Transferred Interest and the Companies by Purchaser, Purchaser may receive
from the Boyd Parties or the Companies, to the extent provided to Purchaser,
certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as certain business plan and cost-related plan
information, regarding the Companies and their respective businesses and
operations. Purchaser hereby acknowledges that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and
other forward-looking information, with which Purchaser is familiar, that
Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as such business plans and cost-related
plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions



underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information, business plans or cost-related plans), and that Purchaser will
not have any claim against the Boyd Parties, the Companies or any of their
respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors,
agents or representatives, or any other Person, with respect thereto.
Accordingly, Purchaser hereby acknowledges that, except for the Express
Representations, neither the Boyd Parties nor any of the Companies, nor any of
their respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
advisors, agents or representatives, nor any other Person, has made or is
making, and that Purchaser has not relied on, and that Purchaser will not rely
on or be entitled to rely on, any representation or warranty with respect to
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements, business
plans or cost-related plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information, business plans or cost-related plans). Except for the Express
Representations and Purchaser's indemnification rights in respect thereof,
neither the Boyd Parties nor any of their respective stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any
other Person, will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification
obligation to Purchaser or any other Person resulting from the delivery,
dissemination or any other distribution to Purchaser or any other Person, or
the use by Purchaser or any other Person, of any such information provided or
made available to them by the Boyd Parties, the Companies or any of their
respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors,
agents or representatives, or any other Person, including any information,
documents, estimates, projections, forecasts or other forward-looking
information, business plans, cost-related plans or other material provided or
made available to Purchaser or any other Person in certain "data rooms,"
confidential information memoranda, management presentations or due diligence
discussions in anticipation or contemplation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section 5.8 shall limit or affect Purchaser's rights or remedies otherwise
expressly provided by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.



Section 5.9 Licensability. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (a) has
been found by a Gaming Authority not to have good moral character, (b) has
been convicted of any offense that would disqualify or otherwise prevent
Purchaser and such Persons from holding an Existing Purchaser Gaming Approval
in any state or other jurisdiction, or (c) has ever been denied or had
suspended or revoked an Existing Purchaser Gaming Approval by a Gaming
Authority. Purchaser and each of its Affiliates which is licensed or holds any
Existing Purchaser Gaming Approval pursuant to applicable Gaming Laws
(collectively, the "Licensed Parties") is in good standing in each of the
jurisdictions in which such Licensed Party owns, operates or manages gaming
facilities (if applicable). To Purchaser's Knowledge, there are no on-going
material investigations outside of the ordinary course with respect to any
Existing Purchaser Gaming Approval held by Purchaser or any such Person and
there are no facts not known to an applicable Gaming Authority or that are not
publicly known which, if known to such applicable Gaming Authority, would be
reasonably likely to (i) result in the denial, revocation, limitation or
suspension of an Existing Purchaser Gaming Approval of any of the Licensed
Parties issued by such Gaming Authority or (ii) result in a negative outcome
to any finding of suitability proceedings of any of the Licensed Parties
currently pending, or under the suitability proceedings necessary for the
consummation of the sale and purchase of the Transferred Interest and the
Redeemed Interest.



Section 5.10 Compliance with Gaming Laws. Each of Purchaser and MGM Member
and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, each of the directors, officers and key
employees of each of Purchaser and MGM Member (and other Persons performing
management functions similar to such individuals) hold all permits,
registrations, licenses, exemptions, certifications, orders, approvals and
authorizations (including the Existing Purchaser Gaming Approvals) necessary
to conduct the business and material operations of Purchaser and MGM Member
with respect to gaming activities (the "Purchaser Governmental Approvals"),
each of which is in full force and effect in all material respects, and to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, no event has occurred (whose occurrence is not known
to the applicable Governmental Body or not publicly known)



which permits, or upon the giving of notice or passage of time or both would
permit, revocation, non-renewal, modification, suspension, limitation or
termination of any Purchaser Governmental Approval that currently is in
effect, the loss of which is, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of
Purchaser to consummate the sale and purchase of the Transferred Interest and
the Redeemed Interest and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Purchaser and MGM Member and, to the knowledge of the
Purchaser, each of the directors, officers and key employees of each of
Purchaser and MGM Member (and other Persons performing management functions
similar to such individuals) are in material compliance with the terms of the
Purchaser Governmental Approvals. Purchaser has not received a written notice
of any investigation or review outside of the ordinary course by any
Governmental Body that is pending, and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, no such
investigation or review by any Governmental Body is threatened, nor has any
Governmental Body indicated any intention to conduct the same, other than
those the outcome of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
ability of Purchaser to consummate the sale and purchase of the Transferred
Interest and the Redeemed Interest and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



Section 5.11 Financing. Purchaser's current cash availability or available
borrowings under its existing credit facilities are sufficient to enable
Purchaser to make payment in full, in cash, of (a) the Closing Payment and (b)
any amounts payable in connection with the post-Closing adjustment
contemplated by Section 2.5. Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that the
receipt by Purchaser of any financing from any Person is not a condition to
Purchaser's obligation to purchase the Transferred Interest at the Closing
under this Agreement.

this Section 6.1 and any Ordinary Course carveouts in clauses (a) through (s)

parties. Seller shall cause each Company to comply in all material respects
with all applicable Laws and regulations, and to comply in all material
respects with all applicable Gaming Laws, wherever their businesses are

Section 6.2 No Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to give Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to

and nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Seller or any
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Purchaser's or
any of its Subsidiaries' operations, in each case, in a manner prohibited by
applicable Law (including Gaming Laws and antitrust Laws). Similarly, except
as provided in Section 6.1, nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to
modify or restrict the exercise of any rights or remedies of any party under
the JV Operating Agreement.



Section 6.3 Seller Cooperation.



(a)Prior to the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement,
Seller shall, and shall cause the Companies to, and shall cause its and their
respective employees, directors, officers, agents and other representatives
(collectively, "Representatives") to use commercially reasonable efforts to,
reasonably promptly provide, at the sole cost and expense of Purchaser,
reasonable cooperation that is reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection
with Purchaser's or its Affiliates' or subsidiaries' reporting obligations
under applicable Laws, including, but not limited to, pursuant to Rule 3-05 of
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, or that is reasonably requested by
Purchaser and any potential lenders or other financing sources in connection
with arranging and consummating financing for the purpose of funding the
payment of the Estimated Closing Payment and consummating any transactions
contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior
to the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement, Seller
shall, and shall cause the Companies to, and shall cause the Representatives
of Seller and the Companies to use commercially reasonable efforts to, among
other things, (a) reasonably promptly furnish Purchaser, its Affiliates and
subsidiaries and any potential lenders or other financing sources with any
financial, marketing and other information and materials relating to the
Companies reasonably requested by Purchaser, its Affiliates or subsidiaries or
such potential lenders or other financing sources or ratings agencies,
including, without limitation, audited and unaudited financial statements of
the Companies and all customary and reasonable documentation and other
information required by regulatory authorities or other Governmental Bodies
with respect to the Companies under applicable "know your customer" and anti-
money laundering



rules and regulations; (b) reasonably cooperate with the marketing efforts of

subsidiaries in obtaining any waivers, consents, estoppels, lien releases, or
approvals necessary or advisable in connection with the consummating of the
financing contemplated by this Agreement; and (f) to the extent the Companies
are to be a party to such financing after the Closing, cause the Companies to
obtain customary legal opinions and execute and deliver customary closing
certificates and documents at or prior to the Closing as may be reasonably
requested by Purchaser, its Affiliates or subsidiaries in connection
therewith. The Boyd Parties shall continue to cooperate with Purchaser, at
Purchaser's sole cost and expense, in the manner set forth in this Section 6.3
from and after the Closing if Purchaser determines in good faith that such
cooperation is necessary in order for Purchaser, its Affiliates or
subsidiaries to comply with their respective reporting obligations under
applicable Law or exchange rules, including reporting obligations, or other
applicable contractual requirements of any of the Companies that existed as of
the Closing Date.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Seller, Parent nor any Company shall be
required to take or permit the taking of any action pursuant to this Section
6.3 that would (i) contravene any applicable Law, (ii) cause any covenant,
representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by Seller or
Parent, (iii) cause any director, officer or employee or stockholder of
Seller, Parent or any Company to incur any personal liability, or (v) require
any Company or any Persons who are directors of any Company to pass
resolutions or consents on behalf of any Company to approve or authorize the
execution of the financing contemplated by this Section 6.3, or execute or
deliver any certificate, document, instrument or agreement (or agree to any
change or modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or
agreement) that are effective before the Closing.



(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary to this Agreement,



(i)no liability or obligation (including any liability or obligation to pay
any commitment or other similar fee) of any Company under any certificate,
document or instrument related to such financing shall be effective until the
Closing, and neither any Boyd Party nor any Company shall be required to take
any action that is not contingent upon consummation of the Closing or that
would otherwise be effective prior to the Closing;



(ii)Purchaser shall, reasonably promptly upon request, reimburse Seller,
Parent, any Company and their respective Affiliates for all documented, out-
of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and
expenses) incurred by any of them in connection with performing its
obligations under this Section 6.3;



(iii)the Company Board shall not be required to approve any financing or any
arrangement related thereto if such approval would become effective prior to
the Closing; and



(iv)Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, Parent, any
Company and their respective Affiliates and Representatives from and against
any and all liabilities, losses,



damages, claims, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with any financing contemplated by this Section 6.3 and any
information utilized (other than information provided by Seller, Parent, any
Company and their respective Affiliates and Representatives) or any assistance
or activities provided in connection therewith, except to the extent such
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties as a direct result of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Seller or Parent.



Section 6.4 Termination or Amendment of Agreements. Seller shall, and shall
cause each of the applicable Companies to, terminate or amend (as noted on
Section 6.4 of the Seller Disclosure Letter), effective prior to or as of the
Closing, each of the agreements listed on Section 6.4 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. With respect to any
agreements listed thereon that are to be terminated, any and all Liabilities
of the Companies thereunder shall be fully satisfied, discharged, or released
on or prior to the Closing.



Section 6.5 Notifications. Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller, of (a) any Actions commenced or, to
the knowledge of such party, threatened, against such party, any Company or
any of their respective Affiliates or directors, managers, members, officers,
directors, employees or agents in their capacity as such, to the extent that
such Actions relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or event
that, in either case, would be reasonably likely to cause (i) any inaccuracy
in or breach of any representation or warranty by such party set forth in
Article III, Article IV, Article V, as the case may be, or (ii) any condition
to the other party's obligations hereunder set forth in Article VII or Article
VIII not to be satisfied; provided, however, that any failure to so notify the
other parties shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.5, except
to the extent that such failure to so notify actually and materially
prejudices the other parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
notification, nor the obligation to, or the failure to, make such
notification, shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
indemnification obligations of any party or the conditions to the obligations
of any party, or cure any inaccuracy, breach, or failure to perform by any
party of this Agreement, or limit or otherwise affect the termination rights,
indemnification rights or other remedies available under this Agreement to the
party receiving such notice, except as provided by Section 6.6. Without
limiting Seller's deliveries to MGM Member under the JV Operating Agreement,
but without duplication thereunder, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser (x) an
unaudited statement of income for the one month period then ended and a trial
balance sheet as of the end of such calendar month, promptly after they become
available and in any case within ten (10) days after the end of each calendar
month and (y) an unaudited cash flow statement of the JV Entity for the one
month period then ended promptly after it becomes available and in any case
within twenty (20) days after the end of each calendar month. Such statement
of income, cash flow statement, and trial balance sheets shall be in the form
currently prepared in the Ordinary Course consistent with the JV Entity's past
practice for management's use.



Section 6.6 Disclosure Supplements. From time to time prior to the Closing,
and solely with respect to the non-Fundamental Representations of the Boyd
Parties contained herein, the Boyd Parties may supplement or amend the Seller
Disclosure Letter with respect to (a) any event, condition, fact or
circumstance occurring after the Effective Date (i) which, if existing or
occurring on or prior to the Effective Date, would have been required to be
set forth or described in the Seller Disclosure Letter in order to make the
representations and warranties in this Agreement true, accurate and complete
or (ii) that is necessary to revise, amend or correct any information in the
Seller Disclosure Letter which has been rendered inaccurate by such event,
condition, fact or circumstance or (b) solely with respect to any non-
Fundamental Representation of the Boyd Parties that is qualified by Knowledge,
any event, condition, fact or circumstance occurring on or prior to the
Effective Date to the extent that Seller first acquired Knowledge of such
event,



condition, fact or circumstance after the Effective Date, and such event,
condition, fact or circumstance would have been required to be set forth or
described in the Seller Disclosure Letter if Seller had Knowledge of such
event, condition, fact or circumstance as of the Effective Date; provided,
however, in the case of the foregoing clauses (a) or (b), that such event,
condition, fact or circumstance does not arise out of or relate to a breach by
the Boyd Parties of this Agreement. The Boyd Parties shall promptly notify
Purchaser in writing of the supplement or amendment of the Seller Disclosure
Letter. Any such updates shall be treated as included in the Seller Disclose
Letter for all purposes of this Agreement, including for the purpose of
determining whether an indemnification obligation exists under Article IX;
provided, however, that such updates will not be treated as though they had
been included in the Seller Disclosure Letter for the determination of whether
the condition set forth in Section 7.3 has been satisfied.



Section 6.7 No Alternative Transactions. The parties agree that from the
Effective Date through the earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of
this Agreement, Seller shall not, and shall cause the Companies not to, and
Seller shall, and shall cause the Companies to, require their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and attorneys not to, directly or
indirectly, (a) initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate any
inquiry, proposal, offer or discussion with any party (other than Purchaser)
concerning any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization,
business combination, liquidation, dissolution, share exchange, sale of stock,
sale or license of a majority of assets or similar business transaction
involving any of the Companies or a sale of any portion of the Transferred and
Redeemed Interest, (b) furnish any non-public information concerning the
business, properties or assets of any of the Companies to any party (other
than Purchaser or its directors, officers, employees, agents and attorneys) in
connection with any such transaction, or (c) engage in discussions or
negotiations with any party (other than with Purchaser or any of its
directors, officers, employees, agents and attorneys) with respect to, or
consummate, any such transaction, or (d) enter into, approve, agree to,
recommend or consummate any such transaction. If any of Seller, the Companies
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
attorneys receives any bona fide proposal of the nature described in this
Section 6.7, Seller shall, within three (3) Business Day after such receipt,
notify Purchaser in writing of such proposal, including the identity of the
other party and the material terms of such proposal.



Section 6.8 Publicity. Any press release or release of other information to
the press or any other Person by any Boyd Party or by Purchaser or MGM Member
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and/or the other
Transaction Documents shall be mutually approved by Purchaser and Seller,
except as may be required by any Gaming Law or other applicable Law; provided,
that, the disclosing party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide prior notice to and consult with the non-disclosing party.



Section 6.9 Government Filings. Prior to the Closing Date, each of the parties
shall, and Seller shall cause the JV Entity to, cooperate with the other
parties in determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or
Consents and Gaming Approvals required to be obtained from, or fees or
expenses required to be paid to, any third party or Governmental Body
(including but not limited to any Gaming Authority) prior to the Closing Date
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other
parties in making any such filings promptly and in seeking to obtain timely
any such Consents and, subject to the other parties' prior written approval
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), paying any such fees or
expenses (at Purchaser's sole cost and expense). Each of the Boyd Parties and
Purchaser shall promptly provide the other party(ies) with copies of all other
filings made by such parties (or in the case of the Boyd Parties, a Company)
with any state or Governmental Body (including but not limited to any Gaming
Authority) in connection with this Agreement or the other transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, that no party shall be obligated to make
available to any other party confidential or proprietary information in any
filings required under Gaming Laws.





Section 6.10 Governmental Approvals.



(a)Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties shall cooperate with each other and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (and, with respect to Gaming Laws and antitrust Laws, if
applicable, shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
respective members, stockholders, directors, managers and officers to)
promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all
applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
practicable all Governmental Approvals, including Gaming Approvals, and to
comply (and, with respect to the Gaming Laws, to cause their respective
members, stockholders, directors, managers and officers to comply) with the
terms and conditions of all such Governmental Approvals (provided, however,
that neither Seller nor the Companies shall be required to incur any
liabilities or pay more than a nominal sum to obtain any such Governmental
Approvals or Gaming Approvals). The parties and their respective Affiliates,
directors, managers and officers shall (i) file as soon as reasonably
practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days after the date of this
Agreement, or such longer period as may be reasonably agreed upon by the
parties, all required initial applications and documents in connection with
obtaining the Gaming Approvals, (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable after
the date hereof, file all required initial applications and documents in

additional requests and comments in connection therewith and pursue all such
Governmental Approvals as promptly as possible. The parties acknowledge that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are subject to the
review and approval of the applicable Gaming Authorities. Each of the Boyd
Parties and Purchaser shall have the right to consult with the other on, in
each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information

(b)Each of the Boyd Parties and Purchaser shall promptly notify the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Body whose consent or

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, appealing as promptly as
possible any such order and having any such order vacated or reversed
(provided, however, that none of Seller, Parent and the Companies shall be
required



to incur any liabilities or pay more than a nominal sum to defend any Action,
or obtain any such consents, registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations). Each of the Boyd Parties and Purchaser shall promptly notify
the other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Body that
such Governmental Body has brought or initiated or plans to bring or initiate
any Action (including but not limited to any investigation or inquiry) that
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on any party's
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or by the other
Transaction Documents. The parties shall cooperate with each other and with
the applicable Governmental Body with respect to any such initiated or planned
Action described in the preceding sentence.



(d)Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, no

its assets, properties, products, operations or businesses, or conduct
remedies or other mitigation in respect of such assets, properties, products,
operations or businesses, or propose, negotiate, agree to do or permit to be
done any of the foregoing in the future, in connection with seeking any
Governmental Approval.



(e)Any fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with obtaining Gaming
Approvals will be borne by Purchaser.



Section 6.11 Government Licenses and Rights. Purchaser agrees that, prior to
the Closing Date, it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
as promptly as practicable all Governmental Licenses and Rights (including all
Gaming Approvals and other authorizations under Gaming Laws) that it is
required to obtain in order for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to be consummated, subject in
all respects to Section 6.10(d).



Section 6.12 Estoppels. Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall, and shall
cause each of the Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
(at sole cost and expense of Purchaser) and deliver to Purchaser executed
Tenant Estoppels by all tenants under the Tenant Leases, and estoppel
certificates from landlords (other than Purchaser or its Affiliates) under all
Leases, in forms reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser (it being understood
that satisfaction of the covenant set forth in this Section 6.12 shall not be
deemed to constitute the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section
7.6).



Section 6.13 Customer Database. From and after the date hereof, the Boyd
Parties shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates (other than the
Companies) and respective Representatives not to, access or otherwise use the
Customer Database for any purpose (except that the Boyd Parties shall have
access to the Customer Database solely in connection with providing email
marketing services for the Companies pursuant to the eCommerce Shared Services
Agreement between Parent and MDDC dated January 1, 2011), and the Boyd Parties
shall not direct, authorize or cause the Companies to use the Customer
Database for the benefit of any Person other than the Companies. At the
Closing, the Boyd Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Companies to ensure that the Customer Database is accessible and
usable for the purposes for which it is used in the Ordinary Course in all
material respects to the extent as at the date hereof. As of and after the
Closing, if the Boyd Parties determine that a copy of the Customer Database
(or any portion thereof) resides on or has become integrated with the
information technology systems of any of the Boyd Parties or their Affiliates,
the Boyd Parties or their Affiliates shall promptly delete such copy (or
portion thereof).





Section 6.14 Certain Employee Matters. Nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall be deemed to constitute an amendment or other
modification under any Plan or Purchaser Plan (including any group health
plan), or shall limit the right of the Companies or Purchaser or its
Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any of its employee benefit
plans, as applicable, following the Closing Date. If (i) a Person other than
the parties makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in
this Agreement as an amendment to any Plan or Purchaser Plan and (ii) such
provision is deemed to be an amendment to such employee benefit plan even
though not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then, solely with
respect to that employee benefit plan at issue, such provision shall lapse
retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect with respect thereto.



Section 6.15 Further Assurances and Actions. Subject to the terms and
conditions herein, each party agrees to use, and Seller agrees to cause the JV
Entity to use, prior to the Closing, their commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Laws (including applicable Gaming Laws) to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, to
fulfill all conditions precedent applicable to such party pursuant to this
Agreement and to execute, acknowledge and deliver in proper form any further
documents, certificates, agreements and other writings, and take such other
action as the other parties may reasonably require, in order to effectively
carry out the intent of this Agreement, subject in all respects to Section
6.10(d).

with respect to the Companies for any Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date. Seller shall make substantially complete drafts of such Tax
Returns available at least 10 Business Days prior to the date such Tax Returns
would be delinquent for review by Purchaser to provide Purchaser with an
opportunity to comment on and approve such Tax Returns before filing (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned). In the
event that any of such Tax Returns are completed by Seller after the Closing
Date, Purchaser agrees to timely file such Tax Returns (or to cause such Tax
Returns to be timely filed) in the form in which they have been agreed with
Seller.



(ii)Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.16(b)(i), Purchaser shall
prepare or cause to be prepared any Tax Returns with respect to the Companies
for any Straddle Period. Purchaser shall make substantially complete drafts of
the Tax Returns described in the preceding sentence available at least 10
Business Days prior to the date such Tax Returns would be delinquent for
review by Seller to provide Seller with an opportunity to comment on and
approve such Tax Returns before filing (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned) to the extent Seller is
expected to be liable for any material Taxes on or attributable to allocations
of income with respect to such Tax Returns.



(iii)Seller and Purchaser shall work in good faith to resolve any disputes
regarding approval of any Tax Return filed pursuant to this Section 6.16. If
Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve any such dispute, such dispute
shall be resolved promptly by the Accounting Firm, the costs of which shall be
borne equally by Purchaser and Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
party responsible for the preparation of such Tax Return pursuant to this
Section 6.16, shall be permitted to file such Tax Return when due; provided,
that the parties agree to timely amend any such Tax Return to reflect the
resolution of any such dispute.





(iv)The Companies shall, at Purchaser's election, cause a Section 754 election
to be made with respect to the Tax period that includes the Closing Date.



(v)Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that (a) for purposes of Section

of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Companies arising on the
Closing Date shall be treated as "extraordinary items" under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.706-4(e) and (c) to the extent any such items arise on
the Closing Date after the Effective Time, such items shall be allocated to
the parties in accordance with their interests in the Companies following the
sale of the Transferred Interest and the redemption of the Redeemed Interest.
Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax
returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the foregoing principles;
provided, that in the event of a required departure from such principles, the
parties shall make such adjustment to the Purchase Price as may be reasonably
required in order to reflect the intended economic arrangement of the parties
with respect to the Tax consequences otherwise arising out of such principles.



(b)AC Tax Refund.



(i)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.16,
(A) prior to the Closing, Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, any
Tax Returns or settlement agreement with respect to the Companies regarding
the AC Tax Refund (subject to Purchaser's reasonable review and consent, such

the Closing, Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared any Tax Returns
or settlement agreement with respect to the Companies regarding the AC Tax
Refund.



(ii)Prior to Closing, at Seller's reasonable request, Purchaser will cooperate
with Seller and the Companies in obtaining any amounts of the AC Tax Refund
owed to the Companies, including through the filing and prosecution of real
property Tax appeal Actions, amended Tax Returns or refund claims. After the
Closing, at Purchaser's reasonable request, Seller will cooperate with
Purchaser and the Companies in obtaining any amounts of the AC Tax Refund owed
to the Companies, including through the filing and prosecution of real
property Tax appeal Actions, amended Tax Returns or refund claims. After the
Closing, within ten (10) Business Days after any amount of the AC Tax Refund
is actually (i) received by Purchaser or the Companies in cash, or (ii)
applied or utilized by Purchaser or the Companies (or any of their Affiliates)
to offset, or in reduction of, any Tax or any other payment, Purchaser shall
cause the JV Entity to remit in cash to Seller fifty percent (50%) of any such
amount received, or so applied or utilized, net of fifty percent (50%) of any
reasonable out of pocket cost to Purchaser and its Affiliates attributable to
obtaining such refund, including, but not limited to any reasonable legal,
financial advisor and accounting fees and expenses and any reasonable out of
pocket costs relating to the collection of the AC Tax Refund or out of pocket
costs associated with enforcing the Companies' rights to the AC Tax Refund. To
the extent that payments are made to Seller on account of any such refund,
application or utilization, and any such refund, application or utilization is
subsequently disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable Tax
authority, Seller agrees to promptly repay the amount of such refund, together
with any allocable interest, penalties, or additional amounts imposed by such
Tax authority, to Purchaser.

inquiries, claims, assessments, administrative or judicial proceedings, audits
or similar events with respect to Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or for which such other party may be liable hereunder (any such inquiry,
claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a "Tax Matter"). Any failure to so
notify the other party of any Tax Matter shall not relieve such other party of
any liability with respect to such Tax Matters except to the extent such party
was actually prejudiced as a result thereof. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

Subject to Section 6.1(o), prior to the Closing, Seller shall continue to have
sole control of the conduct of all Tax Matters (including the AC Tax Refund),

member of the JV Entity, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in the JV Operating Agreement; provided, however, that (A) Seller shall not
effect any such settlement or compromise if the consent of the MGM Member

without obtaining Purchaser's prior written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (B) Purchaser shall have
the right to have a representative designated by the MGM Member present at,

contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for additional Taxes,
notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, the
income, assets or operations of the Companies for all Tax periods, including,
without limitation, relating to the AC Tax Refund; provided, however, that
Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably informed of the progress of any Action
relating to the AC Tax Refund; provided, further, that Purchaser shall not
have the right to settle or compromise the AC Tax Refund without Seller's
prior written consent unless such settlement or compromise (A) does not
prejudice the Boyd Parties in any way in comparison to Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (provided 

 

that the Boyd Parties shall not be deemed prejudiced solely by the fact that
they are not party to such settlement or compromise, and nothing in this
clause (A) shall require that the Boyd Parties be granted third party
beneficiary rights thereunder); and (B) is (1) comprised solely of cash
consideration, or (2) if any or all of such settlement or compromise consists
of any non-cash consideration, then such non-cash consideration must be (x)
currently utilizable by the Boyd Parties, and the Boyd Parties must benefit
from such non-cash consideration to the same extent as Purchaser (together
with any of its Affiliates and any of the Companies), or (y) payable to the
Boyd Parties in immediately available cash funds in an amount equal to such
non-cash consideration to the extent applied or utilized from time to time by
Purchaser and in each case within ten (10) days of such application,
utilization, or receipt (in the case of cash); and (C) the settlement or
compromise in which the Boyd Parties and Purchaser (together with any of its
Affiliates and any of the Companies) participate is the only agreement or
arrangement entered into by Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or any of the
Companies granting any of them any direct or indirect benefits in connection
with such settlement or compromise.

relating to Taxes with respect to the Companies and (ii) retain and provide
the other party with reasonable access to all records or information that are
directly relevant to such Tax Return, audit, examination or proceeding;
provided, however, that (x) the foregoing shall be done at the expense of the

shall be deemed an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, except
as otherwise required by applicable Law.



Section 6.18 Existing Company Indebtedness. At the request of Purchaser,
Seller shall, and shall cause the Companies to, cooperate with Purchaser and
the Companies' lenders in connection with any repayment, refinancing or

at the Closing; provided, however, that any consent fee, change of control
premium, termination fee, prepayment penalty, make-whole payment, "breakage"
cost or similar payment or related cost associated with any such repayment,
refinancing or rollover shall be borne by Purchaser (except that any breakage
or unwinding of any commodity swap agreements, commodity cap agreements,

connection with this Agreement, as of the Effective Date or

the Closing Date, and the amount of other Taxes of the Companies for a
Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to
be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in such Straddle Period.

Section 9.3 Indemnification by Purchaser. If the Closing occurs, Purchaser
shall, indemnify, defend, reimburse, and hold harmless any Seller Group Member

specified earlier date), or (b) a breach of or failure to perform any covenant
or agreement made or to be performed by Purchaser, including all covenants and
agreements with respect to Taxes set forth in Section 6.16 or elsewhere in
this Agreement.



Section 9.4 Limitations on Indemnification.



(a)For the purpose of measuring Damages of the Purchaser Group Members under
this Article IX, except for (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental
Representation made by Seller or Parent that relates solely to the Boyd
Parties or the Transferred Interest and/or the Redeemed Interest, (ii) fraud
or intentional misrepresentation, or (iii) any breach of or failure to perform
any covenant or agreement made or to be performed, the Purchaser Group Members
shall only be entitled to indemnification for Damages suffered or incurred on
account of the ownership of 50% of the JV Entity and its Subsidiaries.



(b)Purchaser Group Members shall not be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to
Section 9.2(a) unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages suffered or
incurred by Purchaser Group Members



exceeds the Basket, whereupon Purchaser Group Members shall be indemnified for
the amount of such Damages in excess of the Basket, and the aggregate amount
of all such Damages for which the Purchaser Group Members shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall not exceed the Cap.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this Section
9.4(b) shall not apply with respect to (i) any fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by Seller or Parent with respect to any representations or
warranties by any Boyd Party made in this Agreement, (ii) any inaccuracy in or
breach of any Fundamental Representation made by Seller or Parent, or (iii)
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller
in Section 4.3, but only to the extent that (x) such inaccuracy or breach
resulted in an inaccurate calculation of Closing Indebtedness or Closing
Working Capital, (y) such inaccuracy was not otherwise addressed in the post-
Closing adjustment process set forth in Section 2.5, and (z) Purchaser did not
have actual knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach and the effect thereof on
the calculation of Closing Indebtedness or Closing Working Capital at the time
it submitted its Post-Closing Statement pursuant to Section 2.5; provided,
however, that the aggregate amount of Damages for which the Purchaser Group
Members shall be entitled to be indemnified and held harmless pursuant to
Section 9.2(a) with respect to the matters described in the foregoing clauses
(i) through (iii) shall not exceed the Closing Payment. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Boyd Parties' aggregate liability for any
liabilities under this Agreement shall not, in the aggregate, exceed an amount
equal to the Closing Payment.



(c)Seller Group Members shall not be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to
Section 9.3(a) unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages suffered or
incurred by Seller Group Members exceeds the Basket, whereupon Seller Group
Members shall be indemnified for the amount of such Damages in excess of the
Basket, and the aggregate amount of all such Damages for which the Seller
Group Members shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.3(a)
shall not exceed the Cap. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set
forth in this Section 9.4(c) shall not apply with respect to (i) any fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by Purchaser with respect to any representations
or warranties by Purchaser made in this Agreement or (ii) any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty made in Section 5.1 or 5.2 by
Purchaser; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of Damages for which
the Seller Group Members shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.3(a) with respect to (i) any fraud or intentional misrepresentation
by Purchaser or (ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of representation or warranty
made in Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 by Purchaser, shall not exceed the Closing
Payment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser's
aggregate liability for liabilities under this Agreement shall not, in the
aggregate, exceed an amount equal to the Closing Payment.



(d)The parties acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing, the
indemnification provisions contained in Section 9.2 and Section 9.3 shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy for Damages arising out of or caused by any
inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties or the
breach of or failure to perform any of the covenants or agreements of the
parties contained in this Agreement (except for any remedies that may be
available under the other Transaction Documents) or, without duplication of
the remedies available under this Agreement, the JV Operating Agreement or
otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement; provided that this
Section 9.4(d) shall have no impact on the calculation of the Purchase Price
(and the components thereof), including for purposes of Section 2.5.



(e)In calculating the amount of any Damages payable to an Indemnitee
hereunder, the amount of the Damages (i) shall not be duplicative of any
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Article II, and (ii) shall not
be duplicative of any other Damages for which an indemnification payment has
been made under this Agreement.



(f)The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement, or on the performance of or compliance
with any covenant, obligation or agreement



set forth in this Agreement, shall not affect the right to indemnification or
other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations
and agreements.



(g)In determining Damages in respect of the failure of any representation or
warranty to be true and correct as of any particular date, any "materiality",
"in all material respects", "Material Adverse Effect" or other similar
standard or qualification contained in such representation or warranty shall
be disregarded for purposes of calculating the amount of any Damages, but not
for purposes of determining whether any breach has occurred.



Section 9.5 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments.

Subject to the allocations set forth in the proviso in Section 2.3, all
indemnification payments under this Agreement shall be treated as adjustments
to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, except as required by applicable Law.



Section 9.6 Notice and Payment of Claims.



(a)Any Purchaser Group Member or Seller Group Member seeking indemnification
hereunder (an "Indemnitee") for any matter (whether or not involving a Third-
Party Claim) shall, prior to the end of the survival period of the applicable
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, as provided in the first
sentence of Section 9.1(a), give to the party or parties obligated to provide
indemnification to such Indemnitee (an "Indemnitor") a notice ("Claim Notice")
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for
indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then
known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim,
and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other agreement,
document or instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which
such claim is based. Any Claim Notice shall be given by the Indemnitee to the
Indemnitor promptly after the Indemnitee becomes aware of the claim; provided,
however, that, so long as such notice is delivered prior to the end of the
survival period for the applicable representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation, as provided in the first sentence of Section 9.1(a), the
Indemnitee shall not be foreclosed from seeking indemnification pursuant to
this Article IX by any failure to provide timely notice of the existence of an
claim to the Indemnitor except and only to the extent that the Indemnitor has
been materially damaged or prejudiced as a result of such delay.



(b)With respect to any claim for indemnification for any matter (whether or
not involving a Third-Party Claim), the Indemnitor shall, upon the
presentation of invoices or other documentation evidencing any indemnifiable
amounts, promptly reimburse the Indemnitee for all Damages reflected therein
in connection with any such claim.



Section 9.7 Third Party Claims.



(a)Except as specifically provided for in this Section 9.7, the Indemnitee
shall be entitled to conduct and control the defense of any claim brought or
initiated by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement for which such
Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article IX (a "Third
Party Claim"). The Indemnitee shall permit the Indemnitor to participate in
the defense of such Third Party Claim through counsel chosen by the
Indemnitor, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnitor.



(b)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 9.7, the
Indemnitor may elect to conduct and control the defense of any Third Party
Claim. The Indemnitor shall have 20 Business Days after receipt of a Claim
Notice to notify the Indemnitee that it is electing to conduct and control the



defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnitor does not give the
foregoing notice, the Indemnitee shall have the right to conduct and control
the defense of the Third Party Claim in the same manner and on the same basis
as set forth in Section 9.7(a) (without prejudice to the Indemnitee's right to
seek indemnification pursuant to this Article IX). If the Indemnitor gives the
foregoing notice:



| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

The Indemnitor shall have the right, at its sole expense, to conduct and
control the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate with the
Indemnitor in connection therewith and make reasonably available to the
Indemnitor all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnitee's direct or indirect possession or under the Indemnified Party's
control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

The Indemnitor shall permit the Indemnitee to participate in such conduct or
settlement of such Third Party Claim through counsel chosen by the Indemnitee,
and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

The Indemnitor shall not compromise or settle any such Third Party Claim
without the consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

If the Indemnitor does not diligently conduct the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnitee may elect to re-assume the conduct and control of the
defense of such Third Party Claim at the expense of the Indemnitor; provided,
however, that the Indemnitee shall not compromise or settle any such Third
Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

 

(c)Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnitor is a Boyd Party, the
Indemnitor shall have no right to conduct and control the defense of any Third
Party Claim that (i) seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnitee, (ii) involves criminal allegations against a Purchaser Group
Member, (iii) involves monetary liability exceeding the Cap, or (iv) would
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the business or
reputation of Purchaser. In any Third Party Claim described in the foregoing
sentence, Indemnitee shall conduct and control the defense of such Third Party
Claim in the same manner and on the same basis as set forth in Section 9.7(a)
(without prejudice to the Indemnitee's right to seek indemnification pursuant
to this Article IX).



(d)The parties shall act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with each
other in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with
all Third Party Claims for which indemnification is sought, notwithstanding
any dispute as to liability under this Article IX.



Section 9.8 Effect of Insurance; Other Recoveries; Mitigation. The Indemnitee
will, and will cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable efforts, but shall not
be obligated to incur any material expense, to mitigate any Damages for which
such Indemnitee seeks indemnification under this Agreement. The amount of any
Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Article IX will be
reduced only by (i) any amounts that are actually recovered by the Indemnitee
or any of its Affiliates from any third party, and (ii) any insurance proceeds
or other cash receipts or source of reimbursement that are actually received
by the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, in each case, less (so that the
Indemnitee shall be made whole for) Damages



suffered by the Indemnitee in procuring such recovery or undertaking such
mitigation, which offsetting Damages shall include the costs, if any,
resulting from premium adjustments with respect to such insurance policy. In
the event that an Indemnitor indemnifies an Indemnitee on any claim hereunder,
the Indemnitor shall be subrogated to all rights that the Indemnitee may have
against any third party with respect to the subject matter of such
indemnification, and, if the Indemnitee is not pursuing such claim, the
Indemnitee will assign to the Indemnitor, to the fullest extent allowable, its
rights and causes of action with respect to such claim, or in the event that
assignment is not permissible, the Indemnitor will be allowed, at its option
and in its sole discretion, to pursue such claim in the name of the Indemnitee
or its Affiliate, at the Indemnitor's expense. If an Indemnitee receives any
payment from an Indemnitor in respect of Damages and the Indemnitee could have
recovered all or a part of such Damages from a third party based on the
underlying claim or demand asserted against such Indemnitor, then such
Indemnitee will transfer such of its rights to proceed against such third
party as are necessary to permit such Indemnitor to recover from such third
party the amount of such payment.



ARTICLE X

Action is final and nonappealable, and



(iii)Purchaser is not in violation or breach in a material respect of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement

representation, warranty, covenant or obligation made under this Agreement by
such party results in the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII or
Article VIII to be fulfilled or satisfied on or before such date;



(e)by Seller, upon written notice to Purchaser, if (i) one or more of the
conditions specified in Article VIII has not been satisfied at the time at
which the Closing would otherwise occur; or (ii) there has been an inaccuracy
in or breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser or a breach
of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by

right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(f) if such
party's (or, in the event the terminating party is Seller, if Seller's or
Parent's) violation or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made under this Agreement by such party results in such Gaming
Authority determination that Gaming Approvals will not be granted.

(a)In the event of a termination of this Agreement, all further obligations of
the parties under this Agreement, except for the obligations under Article XI,
this Section 10.2 or Section 6.3(b), shall terminate and, except as set forth
in Article XI, this Section 10.2 and Section 6.3(b), no party shall have any
right under this Agreement against any other party; provided, however, that
termination under Section 10.1 shall not relieve any party of liability for
any failure to perform or comply with this Agreement prior to the date of
termination, or constitute a waiver of any claim with respect thereto and
shall not affect the rights and obligations of the parties under the other
Transaction Documents.

Section 11.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the exhibits, schedules and
appendices to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, including
without limitation the Redemption Agreement, contain every obligation and
understanding between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
merge all prior discussions, negotiations and agreements, if any, between
them, and none of the parties shall be bound by any representations,
warranties, covenants, or other understandings, other than as expressly
provided or referred to herein.



Section 11.3 No Amendment to JV Operating Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, except for the restriction on distributions set forth
in Section 6.1(i), nothing in this Agreement shall amend or modify the JV
Operating Agreement or Parent's, Seller's, Purchaser's and MGM Member's
respective rights and obligations thereunder, which shall continue in full
force and effect unless and until the Closing occurs.



Section 11.4 Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party
without the written consent of the other parties; provided, however, that this
Agreement may be assigned by Purchaser to an Affiliate thereof, but only if
such assignment does not and would not reasonably be expected to make the
satisfaction or performance of any term or condition of this Agreement more
difficult or less likely and Purchaser remains liable for all of its
obligations hereunder; provided, further, that unless otherwise agreed upon by
the other party in writing, the assigning party shall remain jointly and
severally liable with the assignee for its obligations hereunder. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.



Section 11.5 Waiver and Amendment. Any representation, warranty, covenant,
term or condition of this Agreement which may legally be waived, may be
waived, or the time of performance thereof extended, at any time by the party
entitled to the benefit thereof, and any term, condition or covenant hereof
may be amended by the unanimous written consent of the parties hereto at any
time. Any such waiver, extension or amendment shall be evidenced by an
instrument in writing executed on behalf of the appropriate party by a person
who has been authorized by such party to execute waivers, extensions or
amendments on its behalf. No waiver by any party hereto, whether express or
implied, of its rights under any provision of this Agreement shall constitute
a waiver of such party's rights under such provisions at any other time or a
waiver of such party's rights under any other provision of this Agreement. No
failure by any party hereto to take any action with respect to any breach of
this Agreement or default by another party shall constitute a waiver of the
former party's right to enforce any provision of this Agreement or to take
action with respect to such breach or default or any subsequent breach or
default by such other party.



Section 11.6 Access to Information. Prior to the earlier of the Closing Date
and the termination of this Agreement, and without limiting MGM Member's
rights under the JV Operating Agreement or applicable law, Seller shall afford
and shall cause the Companies to afford to Purchaser, through the Companies'
officers, attorneys, accountants and authorized Representatives, reasonable
access to the



offices, properties, books and records of each Company on reasonable notice
during normal business hours in order to permit Purchaser to make such
investigation of the business, properties and operations of each Company as
Purchaser may deem necessary or desirable to the extent legally permissible
and as would not be reasonably likely to violate the terms of any existing
agreement with any third party or to threaten the treatment with respect to
the continued effectiveness of any attorney-client privilege (taking into
account any common interest privilege or any other available privilege or
defense). Purchaser shall coordinate communications with the employees of the
Companies through Representatives of Seller. Without limitation of the
foregoing and MGM Member's rights under the JV Operating Agreement, prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the JV Entity to make the persons
identified in Section 11.6 of the Seller Disclosure Letter (or other
reasonably acceptable Company Representatives) reasonably available during
normal business hours to confer with Purchaser concerning the business and
operations of the Companies.



Section 11.7 Confidentiality; Publicity. The parties acknowledge that they
continue to be bound by the confidentiality provisions set forth in Section
8.2 of the JV Operating Agreement with respect to the information governed
thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that information is
required to be disclosed by securities or other applicable Law or if the
disclosing party receives a request to disclose all or any part of the
confidential information under the terms of a valid and effective subpoena or
order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or a Governmental Body, the
disclosing party may comply with such requirement of Law and in connection
therewith agrees (i) to promptly notify the other party of the existence,
terms and circumstances surrounding such disclosure requirement or request,
(ii) to consult with the other party, and at its own expense, cooperate with
the other party to take legally available steps to resist or narrow such
disclosure or request, and (iii) if disclosure of such information is
required, to exercise reasonable efforts to obtain an order or other reliable
assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such portion of the
disclosed information which the other party so designates.



Section 11.8 Books and Records. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall,
and shall cause Purchaser Group Members (and after the Closing the JV Entity
and the other Companies) to, and Seller shall, and shall cause Seller Group
Members to, provide the other party with such information as may be reasonably
requested for all periods prior to and after the Closing Date to enable Seller
or Purchaser, as applicable, to prepare Tax Returns and financial and other
reports with respect to the Companies, and each of Seller and Purchaser shall,
on reasonable notice to the other party, have access during usual business
hours to the books and records relevant to such Tax Returns and financial and
other reports, and may make copies and extracts from such books and records,
for all reasonable business and Tax purposes. Each of Purchaser Group Members
and Seller Group Members agrees to retain books and records relevant to the
Companies for all periods prior to the Closing Date for at least ten (10)
years after the Closing Date.



Section 11.9 No Third Party Beneficiary. Except as set forth in Article IX or
the Redemption Agreement, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is
intended, or shall be construed, to confer upon or give (i) any Person other
than the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns any
rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement or (ii) any Person who
is an employee of the Company or ERISA Affiliate, any other service provider
of the Companies or Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Companies or Purchaser,
any beneficiary or dependent of the foregoing, or any collective bargaining
representative thereof (if any), any right to employment, and/or the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any such Person (including any employee of the Company or ERISA
Affiliate) by the Companies or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or under
any Plan.



Section 11.10 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement
shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such provision shall be interpreted so



as to comply with the ruling of such court and such holding shall in no way
affect, invalidate, or render unenforceable any other provision hereof.



Section 11.11 Expenses. Purchaser agrees to pay, without right of
reimbursement from any other party, the costs incurred by them incident to the
performance of their obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, costs
incident to the preparation of this Agreement, and the fees and disbursements
of counsel, accountants and consultants employed by such party in connection
herewith. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Seller agrees to
pay, without right of reimbursement from any other party, the costs incurred
by it incident to the performance of their obligations under this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including,
without limitation, costs incident to the preparation of this Agreement, and
the fees and disbursements of counsel, accountants, consultants and advisors
engaged by any such parties in connection herewith. Any amounts to which any
party claims to be entitled from any other party under this Agreement may be
offset against any amounts in whatever form otherwise payable under this
Agreement by the second party to the first party.



Section 11.12 Post-Closing Assistance and Cooperation. In connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and after the Closing Date, each
of Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to)
use their respective reasonable efforts to establish an exemption from (or
otherwise reduce) any Transfer Taxes, and shall timely sign and deliver such
certificates or forms as may be necessary or appropriate to establish an
exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax Returns or other reports
with respect to, Transfer Taxes.



Section 11.13 Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, all documentary, sales, use, registration, value
added, transfer (including real property transfer), stamp, registration and
similar Taxes, fees and costs incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be borne
50% by Purchaser and 50% by Seller. Purchaser shall take all reasonable
actions to minimize the Transfer Taxes that will be payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid
all required Transfer Taxes to the relevant Tax authority and shall file or
cause to be filed all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable Law, Seller
will join in the execution of such Tax Returns and other documentation. Seller
shall pay to Purchaser the portion of any such Transfer Taxes for which Seller
is liable under this Section 11.13 at least five (5) Business Days before the
applicable payment of Transfer Taxes is due to the relevant Tax authority
provided Purchaser has given Seller reasonable notice and documentation
thereof.



Section 11.14 No Strict Construction The language used in this Agreement shall
be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their
mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
Person.



Section 11.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.



Section 11.16 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury.



(a)This Agreement and all matters arising hereunder or in connection herewith
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of New Jersey, without regard to laws that may be applicable under conflicts
of laws principles (whether of the State of New Jersey or any other



jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of New Jersey.



(b)Each of the parties hereby agrees that any action or proceeding (of any and
every kind or type, whether based on contract, tort, statute, regulation or
otherwise, and whether based on state, federal, foreign or any other law) that
it commences against any other party relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined exclusively in the state courts of the State of New Jersey and
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom, and in no other court; provided,
however, that in the event any such court determines that it lacks subject
matter jurisdiction over any action or proceeding, such action or proceeding
shall be heard and determined exclusively in another state or federal court
sitting in the state of New Jersey and the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom. Each of the parties expressly agrees and acknowledges that all
courts sitting in the state of New Jersey are an appropriate and convenient
forum for resolution of any and all actions or proceedings brought pursuant to
this Agreement, that it shall not suffer any undue hardship or inconvenience
if required to litigate in such court, and that such court is fully competent
and legally capable of adjudicating any such actions or proceedings. Each
party further represents that it has agreed to the jurisdiction of such
courts, in respect of any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
after being fully and adequately advised by legal counsel of its own choice
concerning the procedures and laws applied in such courts and has not relied
on any representation by any other party or its Affiliates, Representatives or

(c)EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.16(C).



Section 11.17 Headings; Interpretation. Article titles and headings to
sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The schedules, exhibits and appendices referred to herein shall be
construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as
if they were set forth verbatim herein. The specification of any dollar amount
in the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or the
inclusion of any specific item in any schedules hereto is not intended to
imply that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included
or other items, are or are not material, and neither party shall use the fact
of the setting of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described herein or included in a schedule is or is not material
for purposes of this Agreement. Whenever the context of this Agreement
requires, words used in the singular shall be construed to include the plural
and vice versa, and pronouns of whatsoever gender shall be deemed to include
and designate the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender. Unless the context
otherwise expressly requires, the words "include", "includes" and "including"
shall be deemed to be immediately followed by the words "without limitation";
and the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereto,"



"herewith", "hereunder", "hereby" and any other words of similar import shall,
unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular term or provision of this Agreement, unless
otherwise specified.



Section 11.18 Further Assurances. From time to time, following the Closing,
Seller shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to
Purchaser such other instruments of conveyance and transfer as Purchaser may
reasonably request to more effectively convey and transfer to, and vest in,
Purchaser and to put Purchaser in possession of, any part of the Transferred
and Redeemed Interest. From time to time following the Closing, Purchaser
shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to Seller
such other instruments and documents as Seller may reasonably request to more
effectively consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 11.19 Specific Performance. The parties hereby agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively
in the courts authorized under Section 11.16 to adjudicate disputes arising
under this Agreement, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies at
Law or in equity, and all such rights and remedies shall be cumulative. Each
of the parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to attempt to assert
or assert, by way of motion or other request for leave, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding involving this
Agreement, any claim or argument that there is an adequate remedy at Law or
that an award of specific performance is not otherwise an available or
appropriate remedy. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond
with such remedy are waived. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the parties agree that (i) Seller shall be entitled to specific performance
against Purchaser (A) of Purchaser's obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to conduct the Closing upon
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, and (B)
to enforce and to prevent any breach by Purchaser of their covenants under
this Agreement and (ii) Purchaser shall be entitled to specific performance
against Seller and Parent (A) of Seller's and Parent's obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to conduct the
Closing upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VIII, and (B) to enforce and to prevent any breach by Seller and Parent of
their covenants under this Agreement; provided, however, that, subject to
Article IX, nothing herein shall affect the right of any of the parties to
seek recovery against any party at Law, in equity or otherwise, with respect
to any covenants, agreements or obligations to be performed by such party or
parties.



Section 11.20 Disclosures. All disclosures set forth in the Seller Disclosure
Letter will be numbered to correspond to the applicable sections to which such
disclosure refers (regardless of the presence or absence of any specific
reference to the Seller Disclosure Letter in this Agreement); provided,
however, that an exception set forth in any section of the Seller Disclosure
Letter will be deemed to be an exception to any other representation or
warranty of the applicable Boyd Party or Purchaser contained in this
Agreement, as applicable, to the extent that (i) the relevance of such
exception to such other representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on
the face of such exception, or (ii) the exception provides a section reference
to such other representation or warranty.



Section 11.21 New Jersey Solid Waste Management Act. Seller hereby notifies
Purchaser that portions of the Real Property were formerly used as the
Atlantic City Municipal Landfill, a dredge spoils area, the Atlantic City
Department of Public Works and a former incinerator. The landfill was capped
and engineering controls constructed between approximately 1996 and 2003. The
closed landfill is subject to



certain operation, maintenance and institutional controls and requirements.
For the avoidance of doubt, Seller intends that this Section 11.21 should
satisfy Seller's disclosure requirements pursuant to the New Jersey Solid
Waste Management Act, N.J.S.A. 13:1E-116(a).



Section 11.22 New Jersey Bulk Sales. Seller acknowledges that Purchaser shall
be entitled to file with the State of New Jersey, the Division of Taxation
(the "Division"), a Notification of Sale, Transfer or Assignment in Bulk (Form
C-9600) and an executed copy of this Agreement, enumerating the purchase price
and the terms and the conditions hereof, as required by law and as necessary
to obtain a letter of tax clearance from the Division. Seller acknowledges
that Seller may be required by the Division to complete an asset transfer tax
declaration in order for the Division to provide a letter of tax clearance.
Seller and each of its partners, members or managers hereby agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such completed declarations to the
Division at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing, provided that
Purchaser has previously filed its Form C-9600 with the Division. Seller
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in good faith with
Purchaser with filing the above documents and obtaining a letter of tax
clearance from the Division. The provisions of this Section 11.22 shall
survive the Closing.
