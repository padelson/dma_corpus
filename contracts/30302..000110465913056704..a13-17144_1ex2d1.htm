WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has,

to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, unanimously approved and
declared advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions and
Parent (in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub) has adopted
this Agreement and approved the Merger and the other Transactions;

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of the Company to enter into
this Agreement, Mallard Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(the " _Limited Guarantor_ "), is entering into a limited guaranty in favor of
the Company (the " _Limited Guaranty_ "), pursuant to which, subject to the
terms and conditions contained therein, the Limited Guarantor is guaranteeing

and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **The Merger**

 



 

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, in accordance with Section 17-6701 of the KGCC, and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company
shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger continuing under the name
"ALCO Stores, Inc." and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State
of Kansas (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation").

 



 

1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place (a)
at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the Company and
Parent, but in any event no later than the third (3rd) Business Day after
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at
the Closing), at the offices of King and Spalding LLP, 1180 Peachtree Street NE,
Atlanta, Georgia 30309, or (b) at such other date, time, and/or place as
agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing
actually occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date." For the avoidance
of doubt, a condition may only be waived in writing by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit of such condition under this Agreement.

 



 

1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
concurrently with the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cause a
certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the KGCC or
other appropriate documents (the "Certificate of Merger") to be duly executed
and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Kansas in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the KGCC and shall take all such reasonable
further actions as may be required by Law to make the Merger effective. The
Merger shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed with the office of the Secretary of State of the State of
Kansas or at such later date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree
and specify in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the KGCC (such
date and time being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 **Effects of the Merger**

 



 

2.1. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the applicable provisions of the KGCC and this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the

2.2. _The Articles of Incorporation_. Subject to _Section 5.11_, at the
Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
(the " _Charter_ ") shall be, by virtue of the Merger, amended and restated in
its entirety to read as the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as in

therein to Merger Sub shall be deemed to be references to the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

 



 

2.3. _The Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ ") shall be, by virtue of the Merger, amended and
restated in their entirety to read as the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect

Merger Sub shall be deemed to be references to the Surviving Corporation,
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

2.4. _Directors and Officers_. At the Effective Time, unless otherwise
determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time,
shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and
the Bylaws. At the Effective Time, unless otherwise determined by Parent prior
to the Effective Time, the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time, shall continue as the

the Charter and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and
the Bylaws.

 



 

2.5. _Further Actions_ _._ If at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be
advised, that any deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance,

desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all
such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such
corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title or
interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 



 

2.6. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, or any
holder of any capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Common Stock (a " _Share_ " or,
collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time, other than (i) the Shares described in _Sections 2.6(d)_ and _2.8(b)_ ,
and (ii) Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") that are, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting
Stockholders_ ") who have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and have properly exercised and perfected and not withdrawn
a demand for, or lost their right to, appraisal rights under Section 17-6712
of the KGCC (each Share referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above being an "
_Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ "), shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive $14.00 in cash (the " _Per
Share Merger Consideration_ "), without interest. Subject to _Section
2.8(b)_, at the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be
outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ," it being understood that any
reference herein to " _Certificate_ " shall be deemed to include reference to
book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of Shares) which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of such Shares, without
interest, it being understood that surrender of such Certificate shall be a
prerequisite to the receipt of payment in respect of any Shares represented
thereby.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share (other than those
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.8(b)_), by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor
and shall cease to exist, subject to the right of the Record Holder of any
Dissenting Shares to receive the payment referred to in _Section 2.7(f)_ with
respect to such Dissenting Shares.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one newly and validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation, and such shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) _Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Any Share owned by the Company
(whether held in treasury or otherwise) or by Parent or Merger Sub, in each
case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall not represent the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and shall be treated as an Excluded
Share pursuant to _Sections 2.6(a)_ and _(b)_ hereof.

 



 

(e) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding Shares shall occur as
a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split) or similar event, or combination, exchange or
readjustment of Shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, or any issuance of Shares pursuant to the
Companys Rights Agreement, dated as of May 3, 2013 (the " _Rights Plan_ "),
the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ ,

 



      
 

 



 

that in no event will the aggregate amount payable by Parent increase as a
result of this _Section 2.6(e)_ (including as the result of the issuance of
additional Shares pursuant to the Rights Plan) and the Company shall take all
necessary actions under the Rights Plan to ensure that there shall be no such
increase. Nothing in this _Section 2.6(e)_ shall be construed to permit any
party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any
other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

2.7. _Payment_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
enter into a paying agent agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company with a bank or trust company selected by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Immediately
prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Record Holders of
Shares, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ through the Paying
Agent, an aggregate cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for
the Paying Agent to make the aggregate payments under _Section 2.6(a)_ (such
cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event
the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by
_Section 2.6(a)_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. If, after the
Effective Time, a Dissenting Stockholder effectively withdraws its demand for,
or loses its, appraisal rights pursuant to Section 17-6712 of the KGCC with
respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the number of Dissenting Shares for which the Dissenting
Stockholder has withdrawn its demand for, or lost its, appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 17-6712 of the KGCC and (ii) the Per Share Merger
Consideration. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by
Parent; _provided_ , that (I) no investment of the Exchange Fund shall have
maturities that could prevent or materially delay payments to be made pursuant
to this Agreement, (II) following any losses, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Record Holders of
Shares in the amount of such losses, (III) no such investment shall relieve
Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this _Article
II_, and (IV) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the
United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed
by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
_Section 2.6(a)_ shall be promptly paid to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as Parent directs. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_.

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days thereafter, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Record

 



      
 

 



 

Holder of Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Sections
2.6(d)_ and _2.8(b)_ ) a letter of transmittal in customary form and with
such other provisions as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree and
instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates representing such Shares
and determining the amount to which such Record Holder is entitled as a result
of the Merger in respect thereof.

 



 

(ii) _Payment for Shares_. Upon delivery to the Paying Agent of such letter of
transmittal by any Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), duly
completed and signed in accordance with its instructions, together with such
other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent pursuant to
such instructions and surrender of the Certificate that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented such Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in _Section 2.7(e)_, or, if such Shares are held in book-
entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry
transfer agent of the surrender of such Shares on a book-entry account
statement), such Record Holder shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange
Fund, and the Paying Agent shall pay within two (2) Business Days, a cash
amount in immediately available funds equal to the number of such Shares
multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration, and, if applicable, the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable as provided above. Risk of loss of, and
title to, any Certificate will pass only upon proper delivery as provided
above. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment to be delivered
upon compliance with the procedures described above may be made to the
transferee if the applicable letter of transmittal and the Certificate
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent and is accompanied
by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable. The Per Share Merger Consideration paid
with respect to any Share in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Share.

 



 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Person presents
to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent any Certificates or
any transfer instructions relating to Shares cancelled in the Merger, such
Person shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in
_Section 2.7(b)(i)_ and instructed to comply with the instructions in that
letter of transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such Person is
entitled pursuant to this _Article II_.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the Record Holders of Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any Record Holder of Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) who

 



      
 

 



 

has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look
only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration for such Shares upon compliance with the instructions in
the form of letter of transmittal referred to in _Section 2.7(b)(i)_, without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of
the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall
be liable to any Record Holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact, in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent, by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount
and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent will make a payment in an amount equal to
the number of Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon.

 



 

(f) _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Person who
has prior to the Effective Time perfected a demand for appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 17-6712 of the KGCC with respect to any Dissenting Shares
shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect
to such Dissenting Shares unless and until such Person shall have effectively
withdrawn (in accordance with Section 17-6712 of the KGCC) or lost such
Persons right to appraisal under the KGCC with respect to such Dissenting
Shares. Unless and until a Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively so
withdrawn or lost such Dissenting Stockholders right to appraisal under the
KGCC with respect to Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive only payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
as required by Section 17-6712 of the KGCC (including any interest thereon and
related costs, if any, required to be paid in accordance with Section 17-6712
of the KGCC). The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt written notice of any
written demands for payment of fair value, attempted withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are
received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section
17-6712 of the KGCC relating to Company stockholders appraisal rights and (B)
the opportunity to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for payment of fair value by Company stockholders
under Section 17-6712 of the KGCC. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such
dissent or demands for payment of fair value, offer to settle or settle any
such demands. Any payment required to be made with respect to the Dissenting
Shares shall be made by Parent. From and after the Effective Time, Dissenting
Shares shall not be entitled to vote for any purpose or be entitled to the
payment of dividends or

 



      
 

 



 

other distributions (except dividends or other distributions payable to
stockholders of record prior to the Effective Time).

 



 

(ii) If any stockholder who holds Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or
loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such stockholders right to
appraisal under the KGCC, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the
occurrence of such effective withdrawal or loss, such stockholders shares of
Common Stock shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without interest, as set forth in _Section 2.6(a)_, it being understood that
surrender of the Certificate representing such Dissenting Shares shall be a
prerequisite to the receipt of payment in respect of any Dissenting Shares
represented thereby.

 



 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the cash
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares, Restricted Stock or Company Stock Options (including the cash
consideration payable pursuant to _Sections 2.6(a)_ and _2.8_ ) such Taxes as
it reasonably determines it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ ") or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or under
any other applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the
proper Governmental Entity, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holders
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

 



 

2.8. _Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time and subject to the consummation of the Merger all
vested and unvested Company Stock Options that are outstanding and are
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Company Stock Option
shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such
Company Stock Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an
amount equal to the product of (A) the total number of Shares previously
subject to such Company Stock Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the Per
Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share previously
subject to such Company Stock Option (such amount being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Option Consideration_ "). The Option Consideration shall be paid
by the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Closing
Date, and in any event within five (5) Business Days (at Parents option,
through the Companys payroll system or through the Paying Agent). From and
after the Effective Time, there shall be no outstanding Company Stock Options,
and the former holders thereof shall be entitled only to the payment of the
Option Consideration, if any. The Company shall take such steps as may be
necessary to provide that each vested Company Stock Option with an exercise
price per Share subject to such Company Stock Option that is equal to or
greater than the Per Share Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof and the holder of such Company Stock
Option shall have no further rights in respect thereof.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time and subject to the consummation of the Merger, (i)
each share of Restricted Stock outstanding under the Company Stock Incentive
Plans or otherwise shall become immediately vested in full and all
restrictions thereupon shall lapse, and (ii) each such share of Restricted
Stock shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be paid as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event within three (3)
Business Days (at Parents option, through the Companys payroll system or
through the Paying Agent) an amount equal to the Per Share Merger
Consideration in respect of each Share underlying the cancelled share of
Restricted Stock.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or appropriate committee
thereof) shall pass resolutions and the Company shall take or cause to be
taken all other such action as may be necessary to effectuate the treatment of
the Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock (collectively, the " _Company
Equity Awards_ ") (including obtaining any necessary consents and releases
from holders of Company Equity Awards) as contemplated by this _Section 2.8_
to the effect that (i) all awards issued under the Company Stock Incentive
Plans shall be settled, cancelled and no longer outstanding as of the
Effective Time as contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) after the Effective
Time, neither any holder of Company Equity Awards nor any other participant in
any Company Stock Incentive Plans shall have any right thereunder to acquire
any securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, or to
receive any payment or benefit with respect to any award previously granted
under the Company Stock Incentive Plans, except as expressly provided in this
_Section 2.8_.

 



 

(d) All payments made by the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 2.8_
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been made and paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the securities represented by
the Company Equity Awards. From and after the Effective Time, no holder of
Company Equity Awards shall have any rights as a stockholder or otherwise of
the Surviving Corporation under such Company Equity Awards.

 



 

2.9. _Escrow Fund; Letter of Credit_.

 



 

(a) Within two (2) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, the Limited
Guarantor will deposit with an escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") an amount
equal to $3,500,000 (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") in immediately available funds
pursuant to an escrow agreement (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), dated as of the
date of this Agreement, among the Limited Guarantor, the Company and the
Escrow Agent, the form of which is attached as _Exhibit 2.9_. The Escrow
Agreement will provide that if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.2(a)_, _Section 7.3(b)_, _Section 7.3(c)_ or _Section 7.3(d)_
and the Company is entitled to be paid the Parent Fee pursuant to _Section
7.5(c)_, and Parent does not pay the Parent Fee pursuant to _Section 7.5(c)_
and any interest and other amounts payable pursuant to _Section 7.5(d)_
within five (5) Business Days after the date of such

 



      
 

 



 

termination, the Company may direct the Escrow Agent to release the Escrow
Fund to the Company in full with the Escrow Fund credited against (i) the
unpaid portion of the Parent Fee owed by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.5(c)_,
(ii) any interest and other unpaid amounts payable pursuant to _Section
7.5(d)_, (iii) any reimbursement obligations under _Section 5.14(a)_ then
owed by Parent and (iv) any indemnification obligations under _Section
5.6(e)_ then owed by Parent, with the excess of the Escrow Fund above such
amounts returned by the Company to Parent. The Escrow Agreement also will
provide that if this Agreement is terminated for any reason and the Company is
not entitled to be paid the Parent Fee pursuant to _Section 7.5(c)_, but
Parent does not fulfill its reimbursement obligations under _Section 5.14(a)_
or its indemnification obligations under _Section 5.6(e)_ within five (5)
Business Days after request by the Company, the Company may direct the Escrow
Agent to release from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to any reimbursement
obligations under _Section 5.14(a)_ or any indemnification obligations under
_Section 5.6(e)_ then owed by Parent, with, subject to _Section 2.9(b)_, the
excess of the Escrow Fund returned by the Escrow Agent to Parent.

 



 

(b) The Escrow Agreement shall remain effective, and the Escrow Fund shall
continue to be held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement thereunder (unless
previously released in accordance with _Section 2.9(a)_) until the earliest
to occur of: (i) the Effective Time, (ii) termination of this Agreement
pursuant to and in accordance with _Article VII_ (other than _Section
7.2(a)_, _Section 7.3(b)_, _Section 7.3(c)_ or _Section 7.3(d)_), or (iii)
if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to and in accordance with _Section
7.2(a)_, _Section 7.3(b)_, _Section 7.3(c)_ or _Section 7.3(d)_, forty-five
(45) calendar days following such termination (such forty-five (45) calendar
day period being referred to herein as the " _Escrow Extension Period_ ");
_provided_ , that if the Company shall have made any claim against Parent or
Merger Sub relating to this Agreement prior to the expiration of the Escrow
Extension Period, then the Escrow Agreement shall remain in place, and the
Escrow Fund shall continue to be held by the Escrow Agent thereunder (unless
otherwise previously released in accordance with _Section 2.9(a)_), until (x)
final resolution of such claim as set forth in a final and nonappealable
judgment or award of a court of competent jurisdiction, (y) as agreed in any
settlement agreement, duly executed by Parent and the Company, or (z) written
agreement of Parent and the Company (any such event set forth in _clauses (i)_
, _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ above, an " _Escrow Termination Event_ "). Promptly
following the occurrence of an Escrow Termination Event or the provision of
the Letter of Credit in accordance with _Section 2.9(c)_, the Company and the
Limited Guarantor shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release the
Escrow Fund to the Limited Guarantor.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the sole discretion of the Limited
Guarantor at any time, (i) the Limited Guarantor may provide an unconditional
irrevocable letter of credit (the " _Letter of Credit_ ") naming the Company
as the sole beneficiary, issued by a major United States commercial bank with
a credit rating of at least "A" by Standard and Poors Ratings Group or "A2" by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc., in an aggregate face amount equal to the
Escrow Fund, and (ii) upon the provision of the Letter of Credit in accordance
with this _Section 2.9(c)_, the Company and the Limited Guarantor shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release the Escrow Fund to the Limited
Guarantor. The Company shall be entitled to make draws against the Letter of
Credit on the same terms and conditions (including in respect of amounts and
timing

 



      
 

 



 

of releases) as the Company would otherwise be able to direct the release of
any portion of the Escrow Fund through the sole action of the Company under
this _Section 2.9_ and the Escrow Agreement. To the extent the Limited
Guarantor determines to put in place a Letter of Credit and obtain the release
of the Escrow Fund, the Limited Guarantor shall be obligated to maintain the
Letter of Credit through the event that would otherwise represent an Escrow
Termination Event. Parent and the Limited Guarantor shall cause the expiration
date of the Letter of Credit to be extended or cause the Letter of Credit to
be replaced with a substitute letter of credit (issued by a financial
institution, and on terms, reasonably satisfactory to the Company) in a face
amount equal to the face amount of the Letter of Credit as may be necessary to
maintain the Letter of Credit during the period required by this _Section
2.9(c)_. If, at any time after the date that is fifteen (15) days prior to the
expiration of the Letter of Credit, Parent and Limited Guarantor have failed
to extend the maturity date of the Letter of Credit or cause the Letter of
Credit to be replaced with a substitute letter of credit (issued by a
financial institution, and on terms, reasonably satisfactory to the Company)
in a face amount equal to the face amount of the Letter of Credit, then the
Letter of Credit may be drawn against in full by the Company; _provided_ ,
that, if, subsequent to the Letter of Credit being drawn against in full by
the Company, it is subsequently determined (by (x) final and nonappealable
judgment or award of a court of competent jurisdiction, (y) any settlement
agreement, duly executed by Parent and the Company, or (z) written agreement
of Parent and the Company) that the amount so drawn exceeds the aggregate
amount that the Company is entitled to recover from Parent under this
Agreement, then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2)
Business Days of such determination, pay to Parent an amount equal to such
excess amount, by wire transfer of same day funds. The Company shall not draw
upon, or exercise any rights with respect to, the Letter of Credit except to
the extent the Company is permitted to do so under _Section 2.9(c)_. All fees
and expenses related to obtaining and maintaining the Escrow Agreement or the
Letter of Credit or any substitute letter of credit pursuant to this _Section
2.9_ shall be borne by Parent or the Limited Guarantor.

aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Companys articles of
incorporation and bylaws, as currently in effect, are included in the Company
SEC Documents, and the Company is not in violation of any provision of such
documents.

 



 

3.2. _Subsidiaries_.

for Non-Management Directors (collectively, the " _Company Stock Incentive
Plans_ ") or otherwise to purchase an aggregate of 378,000 Shares and (iv)
each share of Common Stock has attached thereto a right to purchase Common
Stock of the Company subject to the terms and conditions of the Rights Plan.
There are no outstanding stock appreciation rights that have been granted
under the Company Stock Incentive Plans nor any other outstanding grants of
additional awards under the Company Stock Incentive Plans or otherwise.
_Section 3.3_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, by

 



      
 

 



 

employee, as of the Capitalization Date, the number of Company Stock Options
and shares of Restricted Stock and, to the extent applicable, the grant date,

obligations of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of
the Company Securities. There are no voting trusts, proxies or other
agreements to which the Company is a party with respect to the voting of any
Shares or other Company Securities. No Person has been issued any Company

shares covered thereby, the exercise price, regular vesting or forfeiture

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 **Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub**

 



 

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to the Company by Parent concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ")
(it being acknowledged and agreed that disclosure of any item in any section
or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to any other section or subsection only to the extent that the
relevance of such disclosure to such other section or subsection is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure), Parent and Merger Sub each hereby
jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

4.1. _Organization_. Parent is a limited liability company duly formed,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware
and having all powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits,
consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted.
Merger Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Kansas and having all powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as now conducted. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is duly qualified to do business as a foreign organization and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except
for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger. Parent has made available to
the Company true, correct and complete copies of the certificate of formation
and the limited liability company agreement of Parent and the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub, as currently in effect, and neither
Parent or Merger Sub is in violation of any provision of such documents.

 



 

4.2. _Authority_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder

consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and of the other
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary actions on the part of
each of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other action or proceeding on the part
of Parent or Merger Sub is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and (assuming the
valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company)
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub
enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, except that
such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium

 



      
 

 



 

or other similar Laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors
rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



 

(b) The Escrow Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Limited
Guarantor and (assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery of the
Escrow Agreement by the Company and the Escrow Agent) constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Limited Guarantor enforceable against the Limited
Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (i)
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii) is subject to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in

related to the Company or as may be required under, and other applicable
requirements of, the Exchange Act, the KGCC, the rules and regulations of
NASDAQ, state securities Laws, and other relevant authorities of jurisdictions
in which the Company is qualified to do business, neither the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub nor the

conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the

Parent or Merger Sub, (b) require Parent or Merger Sub to make any notice to,
or filing with, or obtain any permit, authorization, consent or approval of,

time or both, could become a default under, or cause or permit the
termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or
obligation or the loss of any benefit under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party, or (e)
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of Parent or
Merger Sub, with such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (b) through
(e), as would not be reasonably expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
prevent or materially delay or impede the consummation of the Merger or any of
the other Transactions.

(including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto) of (i) an
executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, between Parent and
the Limited Guarantor (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which
(but subject to the terms and conditions of which) the Limited Guarantor has
committed to invest in Parent the cash amount as set forth therein (the "
_Equity Financing_ "), (ii) (A) an executed commitment letter, dated as of the
date hereof, between Merger Sub and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(the " _WF Debt Commitment Letter_ ") and (B) an executed commitment letter,
dated as of the date hereof, between Merger Sub and GB Credit Partners, LLC
(the " _GB Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the WF Debt Commitment
Letter, the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ "; the Debt Commitment Letters and the
Equity Commitment Letter are collectively referred to herein as the "
_Financing Letters_ "), pursuant to which (but subject to the terms and
conditions of which) the counterparties thereto have committed to lend the
amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the
Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ "), in each case, for the purpose of
funding the Transactions,

 



      
 

 



 

and (iii) the fee letters related to the Debt Commitment Letters (the " _Fee
Letters_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment Letters, the " _Debt
Financing Letters_ "); _provided_ , that provisions in the Fee Letters related
to fees, pricing, "flex" terms relating to fees and pricing, "securities
demand", thresholds, caps and other items not affecting conditionality or the
principal amount of funds available under the Debt Commitment Letters have
been redacted. The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to
provide, that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof.

 



 

(b) The amount of funds to be provided pursuant to the Financing Letters, if
funded in accordance with the terms of the Financing Letters, will be
sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents and Merger Subs
obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of (i) the aggregate
Per Share Merger Consideration to all holders of Shares (other than any Share
owned by the Company or by Parent or Merger Sub), including the amounts
payable pursuant to _Section 2.8_, (ii) any and all fees and expenses
required to be paid at the Closing by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, in connection with the Merger and the Financing and (iii) any
other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions (collectively, the amounts described in clauses (i) through
(iii), the " _Financing Uses_ "). There are no conditions precedent related to
the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated by the Financing Letters
or this Agreement. Other than the Debt Financing Letters, as of the date
hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub is party to any agreement with, or has
any other arrangement or understanding with, any Financing Source.

 



 

(c) As of the date hereof, the Financing Letters are in full force and effect.
As of the date hereof, Parent has not amended, modified, supplemented or
waived any of the conditions or contingencies to funding contained in the
Financing Letters (including definitive agreements related thereto) or any
other provision of, or remedies under, the Financing Letters (including
definitive agreements related thereto). As of the date hereof, each of the
Financing Letters, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger
Sub, the other parties thereto. As of the date hereof, neither the Limited
Guarantor nor any Financing Source has notified Parent or Merger Sub of its
intention to terminate any of the Financing Letters or not to provide the
Financing. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both (i) would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of the other
parties thereto, under the Financing Letters, (ii) would result in a failure
of any condition to the obligations of the parties to the Financing Letters,
or (iii) to the Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, would otherwise result in
any portion of the Financing to be unavailable. As of the date hereof, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub has reason to believe that it would be unable to satisfy
on a timely basis any term or condition of the commitments required to be
satisfied by it with respect to the Financing. As of the date hereof, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub nor any Affiliate thereof is a party to any side letters
or other Contracts related to and that could affect the availability of the
Financing other than the Debt Financing Letters. As of the date hereof, Parent
and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any and all
commitment or other fees which are due

 



      
 

 



 

and payable on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to the terms of the Debt
Financing Letters.

 



 

4.9. _Solvency_. Assuming (i) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
Parents and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger and (ii) the
accuracy, in all material respects, of the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in _Article III_ and any other certificate or document
delivered in connection herewith as of the Effective Time, at and immediately
after the Effective Time, after giving effect to the Transactions (including
the Financing, any alternative financing, the payment of the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration and any amounts payable pursuant to _Section 2.8_,
the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions and the payment of all related fees and
expenses), Parent and the Surviving Corporation, taken as a whole, will be
Solvent.

 



 

4.10. _Limited Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
the Limited Guarantor has delivered to the Company the duly executed Limited
Guaranty. The Limited Guaranty is in full force and effect and is the valid,
binding and enforceable obligation of the Limited Guarantor, except that such
enforceability (a) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and (b) is subject to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). As of
the date hereof, no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the Limited
Guarantor under the Limited Guaranty.

 



 

4.11. _Absence of Certain Agreements_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates has entered into any Contract pursuant to which any stockholder of
the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount
or nature than the Per Share Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any
stockholder of the Company (a) agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the
Merger or (b) agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal.

 



 

4.12. _Management Agreements_. Other than this Agreement, there are no
contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements or obligations or
understandings between Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, on the
one hand, and any member of the Companys management or the board of
directors, on the other hand, relating in any way to the Transactions or the
operations of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time.

 



 

4.13. _Brokers_. No agent, broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub for which the Company could have any liability.

 



 

4.14. _Exclusivity of Representations_. The representations and warranties
made by Parent and Merger Sub in this _Article IV_ are the exclusive
representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub hereby disclaims any other express or implied representations
or warranties with respect to itself.

 



       
 

 



 

4.15. _Acknowledgment of Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties_.
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III and any
certificate delivered hereunder, (I) the Company is not making, and has not
made, any representation or warranty, express or implied **(including any
implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular use)** ,

and Parent and Merger Sub are not relying on any representation or warranty,
express or implied, except for those expressly set forth in Article III and
any certificate delivered hereunder, and (II) no Person has been authorized by

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until
the Solicitation Period End-Date, the Company and its Representatives shall
have the right, directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate
or encourage any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, an Acquisition Proposal, including

 



      
 

 



 

by way of providing access to the directors, officers, employees, agents,
properties, books and records of the Company and access to non-public
information pursuant to one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements;
_provided_ , that to the extent that any such non-public information
concerning the Company is provided or made available to any Person that was
not previously provided or made available to Parent, such information is
provided or made available to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently
therewith (and in any event within two (2) Business Days thereof); and (ii)
engage in, continue, enter into and maintain discussions or negotiations with
respect to Acquisition Proposals, or otherwise cooperate with or assist or
participate in or facilitate any such discussions or negotiations. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Solicitation Period End-Date_ " means 11:59
p.m. (Eastern Time) on August 24, 2013.

 



 

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3(b)_ or _Section
5.3(c)_, (x) the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, on the
Solicitation Period End-Date, immediately cease any existing solicitations,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect
to any Acquisition Proposals or any proposal reasonably likely to result in an
Acquisition Proposal (and the Company shall request that all copies of all
non-public information it or its Representatives have distributed or made
available since the date hereof to Persons in connection with their
consideration of any Acquisition Proposal (other than with respect to Parent
and its Affiliates), be promptly destroyed or returned to the Company (subject
to the exceptions set forth in any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into with such Persons)) and cause any physical or virtual data room
to no longer be accessible to or by any Person other than Parent and its
Affiliates; and (y) from the Solicitation Period End-Date until the earlier to
occur of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article VII_, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly:

 



 

(i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(ii) engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding any proposal or offer that constitutes,
or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, or provide
any non-public information or data to any Person relating to the Company, or
afford to any Person access to the directors, officers, business, properties,
assets or personnel of the Company;

 



 

(iii) enter into any other acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar
definitive agreement, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or
agreement in principle with respect thereto or any other agreement relating to
an Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "); or

 



 

(iv) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal, other than, in each case, to request information from
the Person making any such proposal or offer for the sole purpose of the
Company Board informing itself about the proposal or offer that has been made
and the

 



      
 

 



 

Person that made it or to notify any Person of the Companys obligations under
this _Section 5.3_.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may (a) continue to provide access
to non-public information and delay its request to destroy or return non-
public information, (b) maintain any physical or virtual data room for access
and (c) continue to take any of the actions described in _clauses (i)_ ,
_(ii)_ , _(iii)_ and _(iv)_ above from and after the Solicitation Period
End-Date, in each case, solely with respect to any Excluded Party until the
earlier of (x) 12:01 a.m. on September 8, 2013, and (y) the date on which the
Company certifies to Parent in writing that it is not engaged in discussions
with any Excluded Party (the " _Cut-Off Date_ "). The Company shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, on the Cut-Off Date, take the actions set forth
above with respect to the return or destruction of non-public information held
by any Excluded Party and cause any physical or virtual data room then
available to any Excluded Party to no longer be accessible by any Excluded
Party. " _Excluded Party_ " means any Person, group of Persons or group that
includes any Person (so long as such Person and the other members of such
group, if any, who were members of such group immediately prior to the
Solicitation Period End-Date constitute at least 50% of the equity financing
of such group at all times following the Solicitation Period End-Date and
prior to the termination of this Agreement) (including, with respect thereto,
their Representatives) from whom the Company or any of its Representatives has
received prior to the Solicitation Period End-Date a written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (such
determination to be made no later than two (2) Business Days after the
Solicitation Period End-Date), after consultation with its independent
financial advisor and outside counsel, is bona fide and is, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal. For purposes of
clarification, following the occurrence of the Cut-Off Date, the restrictions
contemplated by this _Section 5.3(b)_ and _Section 5.3(c)_ shall be
applicable with respect to Excluded Parties.

 



 

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly
notify Parent orally (and then in writing within (I) two (2) Business Days, if
before the Solicitation Period End Date or, if applicable pursuant to this
_Section 5.3_, the Cut-Off Date, or (II) 48 hours, if after such date) after
it has received any request for discussions or negotiations, any request for
access to the properties or books and records of the Company of which the
Company or any of its Representatives is or has become aware, or any request
for information relating to the Company, in each case, in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal or any proposal, inquiry, offer or request relating to or
constituting an Acquisition Proposal or a potential Acquisition Proposal or
any amendments to the financial or material terms of the foregoing. Such
notice to Parent shall indicate the identity of the Person making such
proposal or request and the material terms and conditions of such proposal, if
any. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall keep Parent
informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within (1) two (2) Business Days,
if before the Solicitation Period End Date or, if applicable pursuant to this
_Section 5.3_, the Cut-Off Date, or (2) 48 hours, if after such date) of the
status of any significant developments, discussions or negotiations regarding
any such Acquisition Proposal or any change to the financial or material terms
of any such Acquisition Proposal, including by providing a copy, if
applicable, of any written requests, proposals

 



      
 

 



 

or offers, including proposed agreements, regarding any such Acquisition
Proposal within (i) two (2) Business Days, if before the Solicitation Period
End Date or, if applicable pursuant to this _Section 5.3_, the Cut-Off Date,
or (ii) 48 hours, if after such date, after the receipt thereof, and the
Company shall not enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the
date of this Agreement, and the Company neither is nor shall become party to
any Contract, in each case, that prohibits the Company from providing such
information to Parent. Notwithstanding _Section 5.3(b)_, but without limiting
the actions permitted by _Sections 5.3(a)_ and _5.3(b)_ and subject to
complying with _Section 5.3(b)_, if, prior to the time the Stockholder
Approval is obtained, the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal from any Person that did not result from a breach of a material
provision of this _Section 5.3_ and that the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal, (x) the Company and its Representatives may
provide access and non-public information with regard to the Company in
response to a request therefor by such Person if the Company receives from
such Person (or has received from such Person) an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company shall promptly (but
in any event within (A) two (2) Business Days, if before the Solicitation
Period End Date or, if applicable pursuant to this _Section 5.3_, the Cut-Off
Date, or (B) 48 hours, if after such date) make available to Parent and Merger
Sub any non-public information concerning the Company that is provided to any
Person given such access which was not previously made available to Parent or
Merger Sub; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not enter into
any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and the
Company neither is nor shall become party to any Contract, in each case, that
prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent; and (y) the
Company and its Representatives may engage or participate in any discussions
or negotiations with such Person; in each case, provided, that the Company
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action described in the foregoing clauses
(x) or (y) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.3(d)_, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or
publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in any
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation with respect to the
Merger, make any public statement in connection with the Company
Recommendation or in reference to an Acquisition Proposal that is inconsistent
with the Company Recommendation and in any manner adverse to Parent, fail to
include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or, in the event of
a tender offer or exchange offer for any outstanding Common Stock, fail to
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the
Companys stockholders within ten (10) Business Days of the commencement
thereof (for the avoidance of doubt, the taking of no position or a neutral
position by the Company Board in respect of the acceptance of any tender offer
or exchange offer by its stockholders shall constitute a failure to recommend
against any such offer), or adopt, approve or recommend or otherwise declare
advisable, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend an Acquisition
Proposal (any of the foregoing actions or any actions described in the proviso
to _Section 5.3(e)_, in each case whether taken by the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Board or any committee thereof, a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), or
cause or permit the Company to enter into any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, or fail to make or reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five
(5) Business Days following Parents written request to do so following
receipt of an Acquisition Proposal (provided that Parent may make only one (1)
such request). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, prior to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company
Board may effect a Change of Recommendation (and, in the case of the following
clause (y), terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_, enter into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement and pay the Termination Fee to Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.5(b)(ii)_) if (x) an event, fact, development or
occurrence affecting the business, assets or operations of the Company (but
not relating to an Acquisition Proposal) that was neither known nor reasonably
foreseeable to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement becomes
known to the Company Board (an " _Intervening Event_ "), or (y) if the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal that is a written offer capable of acceptance
that the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside counsel, constitutes a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , that, in order to effect a Change of Recommendation
under either clause (x) or (y) or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal:

 



 

(i) the Company Board shall have concluded, in good faith and after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside counsel, that
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law;

 



 

(ii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
five (5) Business Days in advance of making such Change of Recommendation or
such termination (such period, the " _Negotiation Period_ "), advising Parent
of the intention to effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_, which notice shall specify in detail
the basis for the Change of Recommendation or termination and, in the case of
a Superior Proposal, shall specify the identity of the party making such
Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof and shall include copies of
the final forms (or the most current versions) of all relevant documents
relating to such Superior Proposal;

 



 

(iii) during the Negotiation Period, the Company shall have negotiated, and
shall have used reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to
negotiate, with Parent in good faith with respect to changes to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or the Transactions (or as to any other proposals
made by Parent); and

 



 

(iv) after so negotiating with Parent during the Negotiation Period, the
Company Board shall have considered in good faith any and all written offers
(that are capable of being accepted) to change this Agreement and the
Transactions from Parent (or other written offers made by Parent that are
capable of being accepted), and shall have concluded, after consultation with
its

 



      
 

 



 

independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, (A) in the event the
Company Boards determination pursuant to _clause (d)(i)_ above is in
response to a Superior Proposal, that such Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal even if such changes or other proposals were to
be given effect, provided that, if any amendment or revision that is not
insignificant or ministerial in nature is made to the Acquisition Proposal
(including any revision or change to any pricing terms) that the Company Board
has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to
deliver a new written notice to Parent with respect to each successive such
amendment or revision and to comply with the requirements of this _Section
5.3_ (including _Section 5.3(e)_) with respect to such new written notice and
the Negotiation Period shall recommence (provided, however, that for each such
successive amendment or revision and successive written notice, the
Negotiation Period shall be four (4) Business Days), or (B) in the event the
Company Boards determination pursuant to _clause (d)(i)_ above is in
response to an Intervening Event, that such changes would not obviate the need
for a Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking
or disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the
Companys stockholders that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law (it being agreed
that the issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop, look and
listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or, upon determination
by the Company that such a statement is required under applicable Law, a
factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes the
Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto, shall not in and of itself constitute a Change
of Recommendation); _provided_ , that any disclosure of a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act other than (A) a "stop,
look and listen" communication limited solely to the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (B) any express rejection of any applicable
Acquisition Proposal or (C) any express reaffirmation of its recommendation to
its stockholders in favor of the Merger, shall be deemed to be a Change of
Recommendation.

 



 

(f) No Change of Recommendation shall change the approval of the Company Board
for purposes of causing any Takeover Statute to be applicable to the Merger or
the other Transactions.

 



 

(g) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 5.3_ by any director or officer of, or any
investment banker, financial advisor or attorney to, the Company, directly or
indirectly, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.3_ by the
Company.

 



       
 

 



 

5.4. _Stockholder Approval; Proxy Statement._

 



 

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with the KGCC
and the Companys articles of incorporation and bylaws to establish a record
date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the " _Stockholder Meeting_ ") for the purpose of voting upon
the adoption of this Agreement and holding the Shareholder Advisory Vote. The
Company shall cause the Stockholder Meeting to be held (on a date selected by
the Company in consultation with Parent) as promptly as practicable after the
mailing of the Proxy Statement; _provided_ , that such date is in accordance
with applicable Law and NASDAQ rules and the Companys articles of
incorporation and bylaws. The notice of such Stockholder Meeting shall state
that a resolution to adopt this Agreement, a resolution to adjourn the
Stockholder Meeting and a resolution regarding the Shareholder Advisory Vote
will be considered at the Stockholder Meeting, and no other matters shall be
considered or voted upon at the Stockholder Meeting without Parents prior
written consent.

 



 

(b) Subject to Parents and Merger Subs timely performance of their
obligations under this _Section 5.4_, the Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement and in any event no
later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, prepare and file
a preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC. Subject to Parents and Merger
Subs timely performance of their obligations under this _Section 5.4_, the
Company shall respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable. The Company
shall recommend (subject to _Section 5.3(d)_) that the stockholders of the
Company adopt this Agreement and the Transactions (including the Merger) in
accordance with Section 17-6701 of the KGCC (the " _Company Recommendation_ ")
at the Stockholder Meeting, and the Company shall include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (subject to _Section 5.3(d)_), and,
subject to _Section 5.3(d)_, shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit
from the Companys stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the Transactions (including the Merger).

 



 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation
of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information and shall promptly supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Merger. Each of the Company, Merger Sub and Parent agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts, after consultation with the other parties
hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by the SEC.
No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC or
its staff, with respect to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company
without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and propose
comments on the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall not unreasonably refuse
to include any comments proposed by Parent in any such document or response.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) As promptly as practicable, and in no event more than two (2) Business
Days, after the later of (x) the Solicitation Period End Date or, if
applicable pursuant to _Section 5.3_, the Cut-Off Date and (y) the date on
which the SEC has informed the Company that it has no further comments with
respect to the Proxy Statement (or, if the SEC has not informed the Company
that it intends to review the Proxy Statement, after the expiration of the
applicable period for comments from the SEC), the Company shall calculate the
Excess Availability and shall provide Parent with the results of such
calculation (the date of such calculation, the " _Initial Availability
Determination Date_ ").

 



 

(i) If, on the Initial Availability Determination Date, the Excess
Availability is greater than or equal to the Applicable Minimum Excess
Availability, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable thereafter, file
the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause such Proxy Statement to
be mailed to the holders of shares of Common Stock.

 



 

(ii) If the Initial Availability Determination Date occurs (A) not more than
five (5) calendar days before or after a particular Minimum Excess
Availability Determination Date or (B) at any time after December 6, 2013, and
if, on the Initial Availability Determination Date, the Excess Availability is
less than the Applicable Minimum Excess Availability, Parent shall be entitled
to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section
7.4(c)_ within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such calculation of
Excess Availability; _provided_ , that if Parent fails to exercise such
termination right within such two (2) Business Day period, the Company shall,
as promptly as practicable thereafter, file the definitive Proxy Statement
with the SEC and cause such Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of
shares of Common Stock.

 



 

(iii) If the Initial Availability Determination Date occurs on a date that is
(A) not within five (5) calendar days of any Minimum Excess Availability
Determination Date and (B) prior to November 26, 2013, and if, on the Initial
Availability Determination Date, the Excess Availability is less than the
Applicable Minimum Excess Availability, the Company shall recalculate Excess
Availability on the next Minimum Excess Availability Determination Date (the
date of such recalculation, the " _Subsequent Availability Determination Date_
"); _provided_ , that if, within two (2) Business Days after Parents receipt
of such calculation of Excess Availability on the Initial Availability
Determination Date, Parent waives in writing its right under this _Section
5.4(d)(iii)_ to require the Company to recalculate Excess Availability on the
Subsequent Availability Determination Date, the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable thereafter, file the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and
cause such Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of shares of Common
Stock.

 



 

(iv) If the Company is required to recalculate Excess Availability on the
Subsequent Availability Determination Date, then, on the Subsequent
Availability Determination Date, the Company shall calculate the Excess
Availability and shall provide Parent with the results of such calculation.
If, on the Subsequent Availability Determination Date, the Excess Availability
is greater

 



      
 

 



 

than or equal to the Applicable Minimum Excess Availability, the Company
shall, as promptly as practicable thereafter, file the definitive Proxy
Statement with the SEC and cause such Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
holders of shares of Common Stock. If, on the Subsequent Availability
Determination Date, the Excess Availability is less than the Applicable
Minimum Excess Availability, Parent shall be entitled to exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.4(c)_ within two (2)
Business Days after receipt of such calculation of Excess Availability;
_provided_ , that if Parent fails to exercise such termination right within
such two (2) Business Day period, the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable thereafter, file the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and
cause such Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of shares of Common
Stock.

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.4_, in no
event shall the Company be obligated to file the definitive Proxy Statement
with the SEC or cause such Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of
shares of Common Stock before the date that is three (3) Business Days after
the later of (A) the Solicitation Period End Date or, if applicable pursuant
to _Section 5.3_, the Cut-Off Date and (B) the date on which the SEC has
informed the Company that it has no further comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement (or, if the SEC has not informed the Company that it intends to
review the Proxy Statement, the expiration of the applicable period for
comments from the SEC).

 



 

(e) Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees to advise the Company as promptly as

necessary in order to cause the Proxy Statement, insofar as it relates to
Parent and its Affiliates, to comply with applicable Law after the mailing
thereof to the stockholders of the Company.

 



 

(f) The Company agrees to advise Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable
if at any time prior to the Stockholder Meeting any information provided by it
in the Proxy Statement is or becomes incorrect or incomplete in any material

of necessary filings, registrations, or submissions of information to any
Governmental Entities in connection with this Agreement and the transactions

(d) The Company shall keep Parent and Merger Sub informed, on a reasonably
prompt basis, of any events, discussions, notices or changes with respect to
any Tax, criminal or regulatory investigation or other Action involving the
Company, and shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub and their

consequences to them that might arise from such investigation or Action
(including by reviewing written submissions in advance, attending meetings
with authorities and coordinating and providing assistance in meeting with
regulators).

 



 

(e) The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper, or advisable to reasonably cooperate with Parent and Merger
Sub to facilitate the transfer of Owned Real Property or other assets to one
or more Affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub immediately following the Effective

the Company to transfer any Owned Real Property or other assets prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several
basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Representatives from
and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs, or expenses suffered

(a) Subject to applicable Law, from and after the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (i) afford to
Parent, Merger Sub and each of their Representatives, reasonable access,
during normal business hours and in a manner not materially disruptive to the
business or operations of the Company, to its officers, employees, properties,
offices and other facilities, books, contracts and records and (ii) furnish or
cause to be furnished such information concerning the business, properties,
Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the Company as
Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives may reasonably request and as is
not materially disruptive to the business or operations of the Company;
_provided_ , that

 



      
 

 



 

(x) no investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and (y)
the foregoing shall not require the Company (I) to permit any inspection, or
to disclose any information that would violate applicable Law or any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality so long as the Company shall have
used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to
allow such inspection or disclosure or (II) to disclose any information of the
Company that would waive the protection of attorney-client privilege if the
Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to disclose such information
in a way that would not waive such privilege. No investigation made pursuant
to this _Section 5.7(a)_ shall affect any representation or warranty in this
Agreement or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto to
consummate the Merger. The Confidentiality Agreement shall apply with respect
to information furnished by the Company and its Representatives hereunder. To
the extent that Wells Fargo Bank, National Association has the capacity as the
lender under the Revolving Credit Facility to undertake any new appraisals or
field exams with respect to the assets or inventory of the Company, any such
appraisals or field exams will be provided promptly to Parent.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could
be, in the reasonable judgment of such party, material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any Actions commenced or, to such
partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or otherwise affecting such
party or any of its Affiliates in connection with, arising from or relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions (" _Transaction Litigation_ ") or (iii) if
such party becomes aware of any facts or circumstances that such party
believes do, or with the passage of time are reasonably likely to, constitute
a breach of this Agreement by the other party or the occurrence or non-
occurrence, of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any party
hereto to effect the Merger or any of the other Transactions not to be
satisfied; provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section
5.7(b)_ shall not cure any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to any party hereto.

 



 

5.8. _Publicity; Communications_.

 



 

(a) The initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions,
including the Merger, shall be a joint press release by the Company and Parent
and thereafter the Company and Parent each shall consult with each other prior
to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements
(including conference calls with investors and analysts) with respect to the
Merger or any of the other Transactions and prior to making any filings with
any third party and/or any Governmental Entity or NASDAQ with respect thereto,
except as may be required by Law, by any NASDAQ listing rule, or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with NASDAQ (in which case, to
the extent permitted by such Law, rule, or obligation, such party shall use
its

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable best efforts to consult with the other parties before issuing such
press release or making such public announcement or filing); _provided_ , that
Parents consent shall not be required, and the Company shall not be required
to consult with Parent in connection with, or provide Parent an opportunity to
review or comment upon, any press release or other public statement or comment
to be issued or made with respect to any Acquisition Proposal so long as the
Company is in compliance in all material respects with the provisions of
_Section 5.3_ at the time of any such press release or other public statement
or comment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior consent of the
other parties, the Company may disseminate the information included in a press
release or other document previously approved for external distribution by
Parent.

 



 

(b) Before any Merger Communication of the Company or any of its
"participants" (as defined in Item 4 of Schedule 14A of the Exchange Act) is
first (i) disseminated to any investor, analyst, member of the media,
employee, client, customer or other third party or otherwise made accessible
on the website of the Company or such participant (whether in written, video
or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise), or (ii) utilized by any
executive officer, key employee or advisor of the Company or any such
participant as a script in discussions or meetings with any such third
parties, the Company shall (or shall cause any such participant to) provide
such Merger Communication to Parent and allow Parent a reasonable opportunity
to comment thereon, and shall consult in good faith with Parent for purposes
of determining whether that communication constitutes "soliciting material"
that is required to be filed by Rule 14a-6(b) or Rule 14a-12(b) of the
Exchange Act. The Company shall (or shall cause any such participant to) give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent on any
such Merger Communication.

 



 

5.9. _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date and for a period of six (6) months
following the Closing Date, Parent shall provide (i) to each employee of the
Company who continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time (each, a " _Continued Employee_ ") salary levels, hourly wage
levels and bonus opportunities at a rate that is no less than such Continued
Employees salary level, hourly wage level and bonus opportunities in effect
on the Closing Date and (ii) to each Continued Employee benefits (other than
equity-based plans) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to
the aggregate benefits that were provided to such employee on the Closing
Date.

 



 

(b) If Parent does not continue the Benefit Plans after the Closing Date, (i)
Parent will cause the benefit plans applicable to the Continued Employees to
recognize all previous service with the Company for the purpose of determining
eligibility for and entitlement to succeeding benefits, including vesting
(provided that service with the Company shall not be counted for purposes of
benefit accrual under any pension plan of Parent or to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits); (ii) Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporations group health plan to make reasonable best
efforts to recognize all deductibles and coinsurance payments accrued by the
Continued Employees prior to the Closing Date and to waive any preexisting
condition

 



      
 

 



 

limitations for the Continued Employees; and (iii) for the remainder of the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs, the vacation and holiday plan
offered to Continued Employees shall be substantially comparable to the
vacation and holiday plan applicable to the Continued Employees that was in
effect immediately before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent will maintain those Benefit Plans that are flexible spending account
plans through at least the end of the current plan year.

 



 

(c) Except as provided in _Section 5.9(a)_, nothing in this _Section 5.9_,
expressed or implied, shall confer upon any Person (including any Continued
Employee) other than the Company any rights or remedies (including any right
to employment or continued employment, or any right to compensation or
benefits for any period) of any nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason
of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the
ability of the Company to terminate the employment of any Continued Employee
at any time and for any or no reason. Except as expressly provided in this
_Section 5.9_, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require the
Company to maintain any particular type of benefit plan. In addition, the
provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to
this Agreement and are not for the benefit of any third party (including
Continued Employees), and shall not be deemed to establish or amend (or
require the establishment or amendment of) any benefit plans, policies,
programs, agreements or arrangements.

 



 

5.10. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the
other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expense. Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in _Article II_.

 



 

5.11. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection
with this Agreement or the Transactions) now existing in favor of the present
and former officers, directors, employees, and agents of the Company, as
provided in the Companys articles of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents or in any Contract as in effect on the date hereof,
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation (and its successors) to establish and maintain
provisions in its articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
documents concerning the indemnification, advancement of expenses to, and
exculpation of the former and current officers, directors, employees, and
agents of the Company that are no less favorable to those persons than the
provisions of the articles of incorporation, bylaws and other organizational
documents of the Company as are in effect as of the date hereof. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor its obligations under this _Section
5.11_ without limit as to time.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect, without any lapse in coverage, the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company ( _provided_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are
no less advantageous to the present and former directors and officers of the
Company (each such present and former director or officer, together with such
persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and
collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") than the current policies) with
respect to matters arising at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) in lieu of the purchase of such insurance by Parent, the
Company shall, at Parents option, if reasonably available, prior to the
Effective Time, purchase a six-year extended reporting period endorsement
under its existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage that
(A) provides at least the same coverage and amounts as the Companys current
policy and (B) contains terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to
the present and former directors and officers of the Company than the
Companys current policy, and (ii) during this period, Parent shall not be
required to procure any coverage in excess of the amount that can be obtained
for the remainder of the period for an annual premium of 300% of the current
annual premium paid by the Company for its existing coverage. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company may elect in lieu of the foregoing insurance, prior
to the Effective Time, to obtain and fully pay for a policy (providing
coverage for the Indemnified Parties and such officers) with a claims period
of at least six (6) years from the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in an
amount and scope no less favorable than the Companys existing policies with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , that the cost thereof does not exceed 300% of the aggregate
amount per annum that the Company paid for such coverage in the last full
fiscal year; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company must obtain
Parents written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) to its choice of insurance carrier. If such "tail" policy has been
obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such policy in full force and effect for its full
term and shall continue to honor the Companys obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the other provisions of this _Section 5.11_, to the
fullest extent that the Company would be permitted by applicable law to do so,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnified Party against and from any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any alleged
action or omission in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer
or employee of the Company prior to the Effective Time or (B) this Agreement
or the Transactions, and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) of any Indemnified Party upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such amount if
it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled
to be indemnified by the Company pursuant to Section 17-6305 of the KGCC. Any
determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any
Indemnified Party complies or complied with any applicable standard shall be
made by independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnified

 



      
 

 



 

Party, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Surviving
Corporation, and the fees of such counsel shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 5.11(d)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, no settlement, compromise,
consent or termination of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
will affect, limit or modify the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation hereunder.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, any other
indemnification arrangement, the KGCC or otherwise. The provisions of this
_Section 5.11_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are
intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties, and the Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this _Section
5.11_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing its indemnity and other rights under this _Section 5.11_.

 



 

(f) In the event that any of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
its properties and assets to any Person or entity, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving
entity or transferee, as the case may be, assumes the obligations of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, set forth in this _Section 5.11_.

 



 

5.12. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (and shall
be permitted to) take all steps reasonably necessary or appropriate to cause
the Transactions and any other dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including any Company equity awards pursuant to _Section 2.8_ in
connection with this Agreement) by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

5.13. _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, prior to the Effective
Time, the Company and its Representatives shall not incur any liability to any
Person under any financing that Parent and Merger Sub may raise in connection
with the Transactions, and that Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and
several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs, or expenses
suffered in connection with the Financing and any information utilized in
connection therewith, except with respect to any information provided by the
Company and its Representatives expressly for use in connection with the
Financing.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper, or advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the
Financing as soon as reasonably practicable on the

 



      
 

 



 

terms and conditions described in the Financing Letters, including using its
reasonable best efforts to (x) enter into definitive agreements with respect
to the Financing Letters on terms and conditions no less favorable in the
aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Financing
Letters (provided that such other terms would not reasonably be expected to
delay or prevent the Closing), (y) satisfy, or cause their Representatives to
satisfy, on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or
their respective Representatives in the Financing Letters (or definitive
agreements entered into with respect to the Financing Letters), and (z)
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing Date, subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions contained herein. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the immediately preceding sentence, each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its Affiliates to take, all
actions necessary to maintain in effect, and enforce its rights under, the
Financing Letters (including any definitive agreements relating thereto);
_provided_ , that each of Parent and Merger Sub may (i) amend, replace or
modify the Debt Financing Letters to add or replace lenders, or similar
entities, and (ii) subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section
5.13_, otherwise amend or modify, grant any waiver of any provision or remedy
under, or increase the amount of indebtedness contemplated by or otherwise
replace the Debt Financing Letters or one or more facilities. Parent and
Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, enter
into any amendment or modification to, replacement of, or grant any waiver of
any provision or remedy under, or exercise its right to terminate any
commitment under, the Financing Letters, if such amendment, modification,
replacement, waiver or termination would or would reasonably be expected to
(A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing
the amount of fees to be paid) such that the aggregate funds that would be
available to Parent and Merger Sub at the Closing (taking into account other
sources of funding that would be available to them, including any equity
financing) would not be sufficient to satisfy the Financing Uses, unless the
Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount, (B) impose new or
additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would prevent
Parent or Merger Sub from timely consummating the Transactions, (C) adversely
affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce their rights against the
other parties to the Financing Commitments, or (D) otherwise prevent or
materially impair or delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger and the other Transactions. Any reference in this Agreement to (I)
" _Financing_ " shall include the financing contemplated by the Financing
Letters as amended or modified in compliance with this _Section 5.13_ and
(II) " _Financing Letters_ " or " _Debt Commitment Letters_ " shall include
such documents as amended or modified in compliance with this _Section
5.13(b)_.

 



 

(c) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of (x) any actual or
threatened material breach or default by any party to any of the Financing
Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing of which Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates becomes aware or (y) the receipt of (A)
any written notice or (B) other communication, in each case, from any
Financing Source with respect to any actual or threatened material breach of
any of Parents or Merger Subs obligations under the Financing Letters or
actual or threatened

 



      
 

 



 

default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing
Letters or other agreements related to the Financing or any provisions of the
Financing Letters or other agreements related to the Financing. As soon as
reasonably practicable, Parent shall provide any information reasonably
requested by the Company in writing relating to any circumstance referred to
in clause (x) or (y) of the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(d) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes or would reasonably be
expected to become unavailable on the terms and conditions or from the sources
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters (other than due to the failure of
a condition to the consummation of the Debt Financing resulting from a breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set
forth in this Agreement), Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the
Company and shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain, and
to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative
financing from alternative sources (the " _Alternative Debt Financing_ ") in
an amount such that the aggregate funds that would be available to Parent and
Merger Sub at the Closing (taking into account other sources of funds
available to them, including any additional equity financing) will be
sufficient to satisfy the Financing Uses, and to obtain a new financing
commitment letter or letters (including any associated engagement letter
relating to any offering of equity or debt securities or other indebtedness in
connection with the Transactions) with respect to such Alternative Debt
Financing (collectively, the " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ ") and any new
related fee letters (the " _New Fee Letter_ "), which shall replace the
existing Debt Commitment Letters and related Fee Letters, respectively, in
whole or in part, and copies of which shall be promptly provided to the
Company; _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to
arrange or obtain any such Alternative Debt Financing on terms and conditions
that are, (x) in the case of financial or material terms and conditions, less
favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the analogous terms and conditions
contained in the Debt Financing Letters and (y) in the case of any other terms
and conditions, significantly less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the
analogous terms and conditions contained in the Debt Financing Letters.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter
may expand upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding on
the Closing Date of the Financing as set forth in the Financing Letters in
effect on the date hereof which would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the ability or likelihood of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate
the Transactions. In the event any New Debt Commitment Letter is obtained, (i)
any reference in this Agreement to the " _Financing_ " or the " _Debt
Financing_ " shall be deemed to include the debt financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to clause (ii) below, and (ii)
any reference in this Agreement to the " _Financing Letters_ ", the " _Debt
Financing Letters_ " or the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ " shall be deemed to
include the Debt Commitment Letters and any Fee Letter to the extent not
superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter, as the case may
be, at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee
Letter to the extent then in effect.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section 5.13_ shall require, and in no event shall
the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to
require, Parent or Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Sub (i) to pay any fees in excess of those contemplated in the Debt Financing
Letters (whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or
otherwise), (ii) to amend or waive any of the terms or conditions hereof,
(iii) to consummate the Closing at any time prior to the date determined in
accordance with _Section 1.2_, or (iv) to seek the Equity Financing from any
source other than those counterparty to (or permitted assignee of any such
counterparty), or in an amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity
Commitment Letter. Subject to the rights of the parties to the Debt Commitment
Letters under the terms thereof, none of the parties hereto, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, solely in their respective capacities as parties to
this Agreement, shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Sources,
solely in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection
with the Financing, and the Financing Sources, solely in their respective
capacities as lenders or arrangers, shall not have any rights or claims
against any party hereto or any related person thereof, in connection with
this Agreement or the Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise.

conditions of this Agreement, to consummate the Transactions irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Financing (including any Alternative
Debt Financing).

 



 

5.14. _Financing Cooperation_.

best efforts to cause each of its Representatives to, reasonably cooperate
with Parent in connection with the arrangement of any Third Party Financing,
including by taking the actions set forth on _Exhibit 5.14_; _provided_ ,
that (i) the Company shall not be required to make any representation,
warranty or certification as to which the Company has in its good faith
determined that such representation, warranty or certification is not true,
(ii) the Company shall not be required to become subject to any obligations or
liabilities with respect to such agreements or documents prior to the Closing,
(iii) the Company shall not be required to provide cooperation under this
_Section 5.14_ that unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business of the
Company, (iv) the Company shall not be required to pay any commitment or other
similar fee or enter into any definitive agreement or incur any other
liability or obligation prior to the Closing, and (v) Parent shall, promptly
upon request by the Company and receipt by Parent of documentation of all
reasonable out-of pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees)
incurred by the Company in connection with such cooperation, reimburse the
Company for such costs and expenses.

 



 

(b) The Company hereby consents to the use of its logos in connection with any
Third Party Financing; _provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended to and is not reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company.

 



 

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to supplement any
information required to be provided to any Third Party Financing Sources under
this _Section 5.14_ on a reasonably current basis to the extent that any such
information

 



      
 

 



 

contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact
necessary to make such information not materially misleading.

 



 

(d) All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company
or any of its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that
Parent and Merger Sub shall be permitted to disclose such information to any
Third Party Financing Sources or prospective Third Party Financing Sources and
other financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties to
the Financing Letters or the Limited Guarantor Investment Letter, or to their
respective counsel and auditors, in each case, to the extent subject to
customary confidentiality arrangements for use by any of them of such
information in connection with the Third Party Financing.

 



 

5.15. _Transaction Litigation_. The Company and Parent shall give each other
the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement and/or prosecution
of any Transaction Litigation; _provided_ , that (a) neither the Company nor

regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent to the same unless Parent
shall have consented in writing, and (b) after receipt of Stockholder
Approval, the Company shall, if requested by Parent, use reasonable best
efforts to settle any unresolved Transaction Litigation in accordance with
Parents direction.

 



 

5.16. _State Takeover Statutes_. The Company and the Company Board shall, if
any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions,
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on this Agreement or
the Transactions.

 



 

5.17. _Standstill Agreements_. During the period from the Cut-Off Date through
the earlier of the Effective Time and the date this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Article VII_, the Company shall not amend, modify or waive any
provision of any confidentiality agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal
or standstill agreement to which the Company is a party (other than any
involving Parent), unless the Company Board determines after consulting with
legal counsel that the failure to terminate, amend, modify or waive such
provision would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law. During such period, the Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
enforce the provisions of any such agreements, including obtaining injunctions
to prevent any breaches of such agreements, and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions thereof in any court of the U.S. or any state thereof
having jurisdiction. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Company from,
prior to the Cut-Off Date, waiving any provision of any confidentiality
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or standstill agreement to which
the Company is a party.

amount necessary to repay and discharge in full all amounts outstanding or
otherwise due and owing pursuant to the terms of the financing arrangements
set forth in _Section 5.18_ of the Company Disclosure Letter as set forth in
the Payoff Letters, including accrued interest thereon and all fees and other
obligations (including penalties or other charges or amounts that become
payable thereunder as a result of the prepayment thereunder or the
consummation of the Transactions contemplated at the Closing or that may
become due and payable at the Effective Time) of the Company thereunder.

 



 

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent
payoff letters (the " _Payoff Letters_ ") from each agent under the Revolving
Credit Agreement outstanding as of the Closing Date (including any interest
accrued thereon and any prepayment or similar penalties and expenses
associated with the prepayment of such indebtedness on the Closing Date) and
an agreement that, if such aggregate amount so identified is paid to such
lender on the Closing Date, such indebtedness shall be repaid in full and that
all Liens affecting any real or personal property of the Company will be
released.

 



 

5.19. _No Control of the Company s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement will confer on Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective
Time.

 



 

5.20. _Limited Guarantor Investment_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Limited Guarantor to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or
cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper, or advisable to
arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Limited Guarantor Investment as soon as
reasonably practicable on the terms and conditions described in the Limited
Guarantor Investment Letter, including using the Limited Guarantors
reasonable best efforts to (x) enter into definitive agreements with respect
to the Limited Guarantor Investment Letter on terms and conditions no less
favorable in the aggregate to the Limited Guarantor than those contained in
the Limited Guarantor Investment Letter (provided that such other terms would
not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing), (y) satisfy, or
cause its Representatives to satisfy, on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to the Limited Guarantor or its Representatives in the Limited
Guarantor Investment Letter (or definitive agreements entered into with
respect to the Limited Guarantor Investment Letter), and (z) consummate the
Limited Guarantor Investment at or prior to the Closing Date, subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions contained herein. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Limited Guarantor to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each of its Affiliates to take, all actions necessary to maintain in
effect, and enforce the Limited Guarantors rights under, the Limited
Guarantor Investment Letter (including any definitive agreements relating
thereto); _provided_ , that the Limited Guarantor may (i) amend, replace or
modify the Limited Guarantor Investment Letter to add or replace providers of
financing, or similar entities, and (ii) subject to the limitations set forth
in this _Section 5.20_, otherwise amend or modify, grant

 



      
 

 



 

any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or increase the amount of capital
contemplated by or otherwise replace the Limited Guarantor Investment Letter.
Parent shall cause the Limited Guarantor not to, without the prior written
consent of the Company, enter into any amendment or modification to,
replacement of, or grant any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or
exercise its right to terminate any commitment under, the Limited Guarantor
Investment Letter, if such amendment, modification, replacement, waiver or
termination would or would reasonably be expected to (A) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Limited Guarantor Investment (including by changing the amount
of fees to be paid) such that the aggregate funds that would be available to
Parent and Merger Sub at the Closing (taking into account other sources of
funding that would be available to them, including the Debt Financing and any
other financing) would not be sufficient to satisfy the Financing Uses, unless
the Debt Financing and/or any other financing is increased by a corresponding
amount, (B) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Limited Guarantor
Investment in a manner that would prevent Parent or Merger Sub from timely
consummating the Transactions, (C) adversely affect the ability of the Limited
Guarantor to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Limited
Guarantor Investment Letter, or (D) otherwise prevent or materially impair or
delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the
other Transactions.

 



 

(b) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of the
Limited Guarantors efforts to arrange the Limited Guarantor Investment.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the
Company prompt notice of (x) any actual or threatened material breach or
default by any party to the Limited Guarantor Investment Letter or definitive
agreements related to the Limited Guarantor Investment of which Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates becomes aware or (y) the receipt of (A)
any written notice or (B) other communication, in each case, from any party to
the Limited Guarantor Investment Letter with respect to any actual or
threatened material breach of any of the Limited Guarantors obligations under
the Limited Guarantor Investment Letter or actual or threatened default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Limited Guarantor Investment
Letter or other agreements related to the Limited Guarantor Investment or any
provisions of the Limited Guarantor Investment Letter or other agreements
related to the Limited Guarantor Investment. As soon as reasonably
practicable, Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company in writing relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (x) or
(y) of the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section 5.20_ shall require, and in no event shall
the reasonable best efforts of Parent, Merger Sub or the Limited Guarantor be
deemed or construed to require, Parent, Merger Sub or the Limited Guarantor
(i) to pay any fees in excess of those contemplated in the Limited Guarantor
Investment Letter (whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained
therein or otherwise), (ii) to amend or waive any of the terms or conditions
hereof, or (iii) to consummate the Closing at any time prior to the date
determined in accordance with _Section 1.2_, or (iv) to seek the Limited
Guarantor Investment from any source other than those counterparty to (or
permitted assignee of

 



      
 

 



 

any such counterparty), or in an amount in excess of that contemplated by, the
Limited Guarantor Investment Letter. Subject to the rights of the parties to
the Limited Guarantor Investment Letter under the terms thereof, none of the
parties hereto, nor any of their respective Affiliates, solely in their
respective capacities as parties to this Agreement, shall have any rights or
claims against any Limited Guarantor Investment Parties, solely in their
respective capacities as investors under the Limited Guarantor Investment, and
the Limited Guarantor Investment Parties, solely in their respective
capacities as investors under the Limited Guarantor Investment, shall not have
any rights or claims against any party hereto or any related person thereof,
in connection with this Agreement or the Limited Guarantor Investment, whether
at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

Day prior to the earlier of the Termination Date and the date on which the
Agreement may otherwise be terminated by the Company in accordance with this
_Article VII_; _provided_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.4(b)_ if it or Merger Sub is then
in material breach of any representations or warranties, or has failed to
perform or comply with in all material respects any covenants or other
agreements, hereunder, which breach or failure to perform or comply would give

right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.4(c)_ within

Excess Availability on the Initial Availability Determination Date (if

7.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this _Article VII_, written notice thereof shall be given
to the non-terminating party or parties specifying the provisions hereof
pursuant to which such termination is made and the basis therefor described in
reasonable detail, and, upon the receipt of such written notice, this
Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability to any Person
on the part of any party hereto (or of any member of the Parent Group or the
Company Group) and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall
cease; provided, that (i) no such termination shall relieve any party hereto
of any liability to pay the Termination Fee or the Excluded Party Fee, as
applicable, or the Parent Fee or to reimburse expenses in accordance with this
_Section 7.5_ or relieve any party hereto for any liability incurred or
suffered as a result of actions or omissions specifically intended to result
in a breach by such party or actual fraud, in which case the aggrieved party
shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity, except as
otherwise provided herein, and (ii) the provisions listed in the first
sentence of _Section 8.1_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
For purposes of clarification and notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not
constitute an action or omission specifically intended to result in a breach
by such party, so long as Parent and Merger Sub have otherwise complied in all
material respects with the obligations set forth in _Section 5.13_.

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

(i) (x) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Sections 7.2(a)_ ¸ _7.2(b)_
or _7.4(b)_ , (y) any Person shall have delivered to the Company or publicly
disclosed an Acquisition Proposal prior to the Stockholder Meeting and (z)
within 12 months of such termination, the Company consummates the transactions
contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal or enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal that it subsequently consummates
(whether the Acquisition Proposal made prior to the Stockholder Meeting or a
different Acquisition Proposal), then the Company shall, within five (5)
Business Days of the date any such Acquisition Proposal is consummated, pay or
cause to be paid to Parent an amount equal to $2,250,000 (the " _Termination
Fee_ "), net of any Reimbursable Expenses previously paid to Parent pursuant
to _Section 7.5(b)(iv)_; _provided_ , that, for purposes of clause (z) above,
all references to 20% in the definition of Acquisition Proposal will be
treated as references to 50%, and

 



      
 

 



 

the reference to 80% in the definition of Acquisition Proposal will be treated
as a reference to 50%;

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.3(a)_, the Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent prior to such
termination and as a condition to such termination; _provided_ , that if such
termination occurs prior to the Cut-Off Date on account of a Superior Proposal
made by a Person that is an Excluded Party, then the Company shall pay to
Parent an amount equal to $1,750,000 (the " _Excluded Party Fee_ "), in each
case by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by
Parent;

 



 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_,
the Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent promptly, but in any event
within five (5) Business Days, after the date of such termination; _provided_

Business Days, after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to

Any payment made by Parent under this _Section 7.5(c)_ is referred to herein
as the " _Parent Fee_." The Company may, at its election, recover any payment
due to it under this _Section 7.5(c)_ or _Section 7.5(d)_ by directing a

(d) Parent and the Company acknowledge that (i) the fees and other provisions
of this _Section 7.5_ are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) without
these agreements, Parent and the Company would not enter into this Agreement

Fee (or portion thereof), as applicable, the Company or Parent, as applicable,
shall pay to the other party hereto its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of
such fee from the date such payment was required to be made to the date of
payment at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the date
such payment was required to be made.

doubt, (x) the amounts Parent is entitled to collect, if due, that are
specified in clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 7.5(e)_ are intended to

member of the Company Group under this Agreement in the event the Company

breaches this Agreement or fails to perform hereunder, and under no
circumstances shall Parent be entitled to collect, if due, more than the

such amounts. For the avoidance of doubt, the amounts the Company is entitled
to collect, if due, that are specified in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of

Parent and Merger Sub to cause, or for the Company to directly cause, in

8.7. _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
under this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. Accordingly, subject to the last sentence of _Section
7.5(f)_, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_, the parties shall be
entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity, to an injunction (without posting a bond, demonstrating irreparable
harm or establishing the unavailability or unsuitability of monetary damages),
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the

law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
this _Section 8.7_ is not intended and shall not be construed to limit in any

(b) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that (i) there
is adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity, other than on the basis
that such remedy is not expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. If any of the parties hereto seeks an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, such party or parties shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations
and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the
rights of third party beneficiaries under _Section 5.11_ shall not arise
unless and until the Effective Time occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

Guarantor Investment Letter (and each such partys Representatives) shall be

instructions signed by MIP and the Company, the Escrow Agent shall invest all
funds held pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the Investment
Selection Instructions set forth as Exhibit 3.1 hereto. The Escrow Agent shall
have no liability for any loss resulting from investments made in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement. All income from such invested cash
shall be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent as part of the Escrow Fund. On
or before the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of MIP and the
Company shall provide the Escrow Agent a completed Form W-9 or W-8, whichever
is appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein provided, the
Escrow Agent shall have no duty to prepare or file any federal or state tax
report or return with respect to any funds held pursuant to this Agreement or
any income earned thereon.

 



 

3.2 _Disbursement of the Escrow Fund Pursuant to Company Direction_. To the
extent that the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.2(a),
Section 7.3(b), Section 7.3(c) or Section 7.3(d) of the Merger Agreement and
the Company is entitled to be paid the Parent Fee pursuant to Section 7.5(c)
of the Merger Agreement, and Parent does not pay the Parent Fee pursuant to
Section 7.5(c) of the Merger Agreement and any interest and other amounts
payable pursuant to Section 7.5(d) of the Merger Agreement within five (5)
Business Days after the date of such termination, the Company may direct the
Escrow Agent to release the Escrow Fund to the Company in full. In the event
the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason and the Company is not
entitled to be paid the Parent Fee pursuant to Section 7.5(c) of the Merger
Agreement, but Parent does not fulfill its reimbursement obligations under
Section 5.14(a) of the Merger Agreement or its indemnification obligations
under Section 5.6(e) of the Merger Agreement within five (5) Business Days
after request by the Company, the Company may direct the Escrow Agent to
release from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to any reimbursement obligations
under Section 5.14(a) of the Merger Agreement or any indemnification
obligations under Section 5.6(e) of the Merger Agreement then owed by Parent,
with, subject to Section 2.9(b) of the Merger Agreement, the excess of the
Escrow Fund returned by the Escrow Agent to Parent. The Company may make a
claim against the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Section 3.2 (an " _Escrow
Claim_ ") by delivering written notice thereof to the Escrow Agent and MIP ("
_Escrow Notice_ ").

 



 

3.3 The Escrow Agent shall disburse the amounts from time to time on deposit
in the Escrow Fund as follows:

 



 

(a) with respect to an Escrow Claim, the Escrow Claim shall be paid on the
third (3rd) Business Day after receipt by the Escrow Agent of an Escrow
Notice, including wire transfer instructions for the account of the Company;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) upon a joint written instruction from MIP and the Company directing the
release of the Escrow Fund, together with wire transfer instructions for
payment; and

 



 

(c) as soon as practicable following the Effective Time of the Merger (such
date, the " _Final Release Date_ "), upon written notice furnished by MIP to
the Escrow Agent (a " _Release Notice_ "), the Escrow Agent shall distribute
to MIP, or its designee, an amount, equal to the balance of the Escrow Fund.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent MIP objects in writing to any
Escrow Claim by delivery of written notice of objection to the Company and the
Escrow Agent not later than 5:00 P.M. Atlanta, Georgia time, on the Business
Day immediately preceding any release of the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section
3.3(a), neither the Escrow Fund nor any portion thereof shall be released
pursuant to the Escrow Claim with respect to which such an objection has been
delivered by MIP until a Final Decision with respect thereto has been
delivered to the Escrow Agent.

 



 

" _Final Decision_ " means a written settlement signed jointly by MIP and the
Company, or the entry of a judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction with
respect to amounts in the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
assume conclusively and without independent investigation that evidence of a
Final Decision is sufficient and shall have no duty to determine whether any
such Final Decision complies with the Merger Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Escrow Fund_. The escrow provided for hereunder shall
terminate upon the disbursement of the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

 



 

4. _Escrow Agent_.

 



 

4.1 _Duties_. In performing its duties under this Agreement or upon the
claimed failure to perform its duties hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall have
no liability except for the Escrow Agents willful misconduct or gross
negligence. The Escrow Agents sole responsibility shall be for the
safekeeping and disbursement of the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties or
obligations and shall not be charged with knowledge or notice of any fact or
circumstance not specifically set forth herein. The Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon and shall be protected in acting upon any request,
instruction, statement or other instrument, not only as to its due execution,
validity and effectiveness, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any
information contained therein, which the Escrow Agent shall in good faith
believe to be genuine, to have been signed or presented by the person or
parties purporting to sign the same and to conform to the provisions of this
Agreement. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for incidental,
indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages. The Escrow Agent shall
not be obligated to take any legal action or to commence any

 



      
 

 



 

proceeding in connection with the Escrow Fund, any account in which the Escrow
Fund is deposited, or this Agreement, or to appear in, prosecute or defend any
such legal action or proceedings. The Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel
selected by it in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction
of any of the provisions hereof or of any other agreement or of its duties
hereunder, and shall incur no liability and shall be fully protected from any
liability whatsoever in acting in accordance with the advice, opinion or
instruction of such counsel. MIP and the Company shall be jointly and
severally liable for, and shall promptly pay, upon demand, the reasonable and
documented fees and expenses of any such legal counsel. The Escrow Agent shall
have no liability with respect to the transfer or distribution of any funds
effected by the Escrow Agent pursuant to wiring or transfer instructions
provided to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not be required to take notice of or have
any obligations or responsibilities in connection with the Merger Agreement,
the transactions contemplated thereby or any other agreement between any other
parties to the Merger Agreement, other than this Agreement.

 



 

4.2 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and at all times after the date of this Agreement, MIP and the
Company shall, jointly and severally, to the fullest extent permitted by law
and to the extent provided herein, indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow
Agent and each director, officer, employee, attorney, agent and affiliate of
the Escrow Agent (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any and
all actions, claims (whether or not valid), losses, damages, liabilities,
costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including reasonable
attorneys fees, costs and expenses) incurred by or asserted against any of
the Indemnified Parties from and after the date hereof in connection with the
Escrow Agents good faith acceptance of and performance of its duties and
obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Indemnified
Party shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for any liability (or
any cost or expense related to such liability, including attorneys fees,
costs and expenses) finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction,
subject to no further appeal, to have resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party. If any such action or claim
shall be brought or asserted against any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified
Party shall promptly notify MIP and the Company in writing, and MIP and the
Company shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel
and the payment of all expenses. Such Indemnified Party shall, in its sole
discretion, have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and
to participate in the defense thereof, and the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified Party unless (i) MIP and the Company
agree in writing to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) MIP and the Company shall
fail to assume the defense of such action or proceeding or shall fail, in the
reasonable discretion of such Indemnified Party, to employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party in any such action or proceeding, or
(iii) the named parties to any such action or proceeding (including any
impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and
MIP or the Company, on

 



      
 

 



 

the other hand, and the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel
that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are
different from or additional to those available to MIP or the Company. All
such fees and expenses payable by MIP and the Company pursuant to the
foregoing sentence shall be paid from time to time as incurred, both in
advance of and after the final disposition of such action or claim. All of the
foregoing losses, damages, costs and expenses of the Indemnified Parties shall
be payable upon demand of such Indemnified Party, jointly and severally, by
the MIP and the Company. The obligations of MIP and the Company under this
Section 4.2 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the
resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that neither the payment by MIP and the Company of any
claim by the Escrow Agent for indemnification hereunder nor the disbursement
of any amounts to the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Fund in respect of a claim
by the Escrow Agent for indemnification shall impair, limit, modify, or
affect, as between MIP and the Company, the respective rights and obligations
of the Company, on the one hand, and MIP, on the other hand, under this
Agreement. MIP and the Company agree, solely among themselves, that any
obligation for indemnification under this Section 4.2 (or for fees and
expenses of the Escrow Agent described in Section 4.1) shall be borne by the
Party or Parties determined by an arbitrator or a court of competent
jurisdiction to be responsible for causing the loss, damage, liability, cost
or expense for which the Escrow Agent is entitled to indemnification or, if no
such determination is made, then one-half by MIP and one-half by the Company.

 



 

4.3 _Disputes_. If, at any time, there shall exist any dispute between MIP and
the Company with respect to the holding or disposition of any portion of the
Escrow Fund or any other obligations of the Escrow Agent hereunder, or if at
any time the Escrow Agent is unable to determine, to the Escrow Agents sole
satisfaction, the proper disposition of any portion of the Escrow Fund or the
Escrow Agents proper actions with respect to its obligations hereunder, or if
MIP and the Company have not, within thirty (30) days of the furnishing by the
Escrow Agent of a notice of resignation pursuant to Section 4.4 below,
appointed a successor escrow agent to act hereunder, then the Escrow Agent
may, in its sole discretion, take either or both of the following actions:

 



 

(a) suspend the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement
until such dispute or uncertainty shall be resolved to the sole satisfaction
of the Escrow Agent or until a successor escrow agent shall have been
appointed (as the case may be); or

 



 

(b) petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other appropriate
method) any court of competent jurisdiction, for instructions with respect to
such dispute or uncertainty, and pay into or deposit with such court all
disputed Escrow Funds held by it in the Escrow Fund for holding and
disposition in accordance

 



      
 

 



 

with the instructions of such court, and the Escrow Agent shall thereupon be
discharged from all further obligations as Escrow Agent under this Agreement.

 



 

The Escrow Agent shall have no liability to MIP, the Company or any other
person with respect to any such suspension of performance or disbursement into
court, specifically including any liability that may arise, or be alleged to
have arisen, out of or as a result of any delay in the disbursement of funds
held in the Escrow Fund or any delay in or with respect to any other action
required or requested of the Escrow Agent.

 



 

4.4 _Resignation of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent may resign from the
performance of its duties hereunder at any time by giving at least thirty (30)
days prior written notice to MIP and the Company or may be removed, with or
without cause, by MIP and the Company, acting jointly, at any time by the
giving of at least ten (10) days prior written notice to the Escrow Agent.
Such resignation or removal shall take effect upon the appointment of a
successor escrow agent as provided herein. Upon any such notice of resignation
or removal, MIP and the Company, acting jointly, shall appoint a successor
escrow agent hereunder, which shall be a commercial bank, trust company or
other financial institution with a combined capital and surplus in excess of
$1 billion, unless otherwise agreed by MIP and the Company. In the event MIP
and the Company shall fail to appoint a successor escrow agent within thirty
(30) days after the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent, as
contemplated hereby, the Escrow Agent may deposit the Escrow Fund into the
registry of a court of competent jurisdiction and shall thereupon be
discharged from all further duties as Escrow Agent under this Agreement. Upon
the acceptance in writing of any appointment as Escrow Agent hereunder by a
successor escrow agent, such successor escrow agent shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Escrow Agent, and the retiring Escrow Agent shall be discharged from
its duties and obligations under this Agreement, but shall not be discharged
from any liability for actions taken as Escrow Agent hereunder prior to such
succession. After any retiring Escrow Agents resignation or removal, the
provisions of this Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Escrow Agent under this
Agreement.

 



 

4.5 _Receipt_. By its execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agent acknowledges receipt of the Escrow Amount.

 



 

4.6 _Fees_. MIP agrees to pay the Escrow Agent compensation, and to reimburse
the Escrow Agent for costs and expenses, all in accordance with the provisions
of Schedule I hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof, and further agree that the Escrow Agent shall have a lien on the
Escrow Fund for payment of its fees and expenses from amounts held in the
Escrow Fund if such fees and expenses are not otherwise paid and without
judicial action to foreclose such lien. The obligations of MIP under this
Section

 



      
 

 



 

4.6 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the resignation or
removal of the Escrow Agent.

 



 

5. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

5.1 _Notices_. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) if personally delivered, on
the date of delivery, (b) if delivered by express courier service of national
standing (with charges prepaid), on the Business Day following the date of
delivery to such courier service, (c) if deposited in the United States mail,
first-class postage prepaid, on the fifth Business Day following the date of
such deposit, or (d) if delivered by facsimile transmission, upon confirmation
of successful transmission, (i) on the date of such transmission, if such
transmission is completed at or prior to 5:00 p.m., local time of the
recipient Party on a Business Day, on the date of such transmission, and (ii)
on the next Business Day following the date of transmission, if such
transmission is completed after 5:00 p.m., local time of the recipient Party,
on the date of such transmission or is transmitted on a day that is not a
Business Day; provided, however, that no notice, demand or other
communications shall be deemed received by the Escrow Agent prior to its
actual receipt thereof. All notices, demands and other communications
hereunder shall be delivered as set forth below, or pursuant to such other
instructions as may be designated in writing by the Party to receive such
notice:

or to such other persons or addresses as may be designated in writing by the
Party to receive such notice as provided above.

 



 

5.2 _Time of the Essence; Computation of Time_. Time is of the essence for
each and every provision of this Agreement. Whenever the last day for the
exercise of any privilege or the discharge of any duty under this Agreement
shall fall upon a Saturday, Sunday or any date on which banks in Georgia are
closed, the Party having such privilege or duty may exercise such privilege or
discharge such duty on the next succeeding day which is a regular Business
Day.

 



 

5.3 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, nor shall any of
the duties hereunder be delegated, by any of the Parties (whether by operation
of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party;
_provided_ , that MIP may assign this Agreement (in whole but not in part),
but may not delegate any duties hereunder, to any wholly owned Affiliate of
MIP. No assignment by any Party shall relieve such assigning Party of any of
its obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Party and
their respective permitted successors and assigns. Any purported assignment in
violation of this Section 5.3 shall be void.

 



 

5.4 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other
jurisdiction.

 



 

5.5 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Service of Process_. This Agreement and all
Actions (whether at law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of
law. Each Party agrees that it shall bring any Action among the Parties or
involving any member of the Company Group or Parent Group arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contained in or contemplated by
this Agreement exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (together with the appellate courts thereof, the
" _Chosen Courts_ "), and solely with respect to any such Action (i)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii)
waives any objection to laying venue in any such Action in the Chosen Courts,
(iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or
do not have jurisdiction over any Party hereto or any member of the Company
Group or Parent Group and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such Party
in any such Action shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with
Section 5.1.

 



 

5.6 _Interpretation; Rules of Construction_. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, or Sections, such reference shall be to an
Exhibit to, Schedule of, or Section of this Agreement, respectively, unless
otherwise indicated. The words "include", "includes" and "including" when used
herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. All references herein to "$" or dollars shall refer to United
States dollars, unless otherwise specified. The Parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement; accordingly, in the
event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party
by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

5.7 _Amendments; Waiver_. Subject to the provisions of applicable Laws, the
Parties may modify or amend this Agreement, by written agreement executed and
delivered by the duly authorized officers of each of the respective Parties.
The Parties may waive or extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties. Any agreement on the part of a
Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party
to

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 



 

5.8 _No Limitation_. The Parties (other than the Escrow Agent) agree that the
rights and remedies of any Party under this Agreement shall not operate to
limit any other rights and remedies otherwise available to any Party under the
Merger Agreement.

 



 

5.9 _Facsimile Execution; Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile or other electronic transmission in one or more counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute
one and the same agreement.

 



 

5.10 _Other Transactions with MIP or the Company_. The Escrow Agent and any
stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Escrow Agent may become
pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which MIP or the Company may be
interested, and contract and lend money to MIP or the Company and otherwise
act as fully and freely as though it were not Escrow Agent under this
Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Escrow Agent from acting in any
other capacity for MIP, the Company or for any other entity.

 



 

5.11 _Authorized Signatures._ Contemporaneously with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and, if necessary, from time to time thereafter,
each of the Parties (other than the Escrow Agent) shall execute and deliver to
the Escrow Agent a Certificate of Incumbency substantially in the form of
Exhibit 5.11 hereto (a " _Certificate of Incumbency_ ") for the purpose of
establishing the identity and authority of persons entitled to issue notices,
instructions or directions to the Escrow Agent on behalf of each such party.
Until such time as the Escrow Agent shall receive an amended Certificate of
Incumbency replacing any Certificate of Incumbency theretofore delivered to
the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be fully protected in relying,
without further inquiry, on the most recent Certificate of Incumbency
furnished to the Escrow Agent. Whenever this Agreement provides for joint
written notices, joint written instructions or other joint actions to be
delivered to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be fully protected in
relying, without further inquiry, on any joint written notice, instructions or
action executed by persons named in such Certificate of Incumbency.
