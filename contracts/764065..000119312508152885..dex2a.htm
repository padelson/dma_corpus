v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this _"Agreement"_ ), dated as of July 15, 2008,
by and among Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, an Ohio corporation ( _"Parent_ _"_ ),
Daily Double Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ( _"Merger Sub"_ ), and Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the _"Company"_ ).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and Parent have
each determined that a business combination between Parent and the Company
is in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders and,
accordingly, have agreed to effect the merger of the Merger Sub with and into
the Company (the _"Merger"_ ), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the _"DGCL"_ ), whereby each issued
and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company ( _"Company Common Stock"_ ), other than Dissenting Shares and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect
subsidiary of Parent or held in the treasury of the Company, will be converted
into the right to receive 0.95 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a share of
common stock, par value $0.125 per share, of Parent ( _"Parent Common Stock"_
) and cash as provided in _Section 2.1_;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the Merger
is advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders;

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger will
qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the _"Code"_ ), and any comparable
provisions of state or local law, and this Agreement is intended to be and is
adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of
the Code.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub will be merged with
and into the  



 

1  Company at the Effective Time, and the separate corporate existence of the
Merger Sub will thereupon cease. Following the Effective Time, the Company
will be the surviving corporation (the _"Surviving Corporation"_ ).

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the _"Closing"_ ) will take
place at a time and on a date to be specified by the parties hereto, which is
to be no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver by the party entitled to the
benefit thereof of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their terms,
cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but subject to the fulfillment or
(to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver by the party entitled to
the benefit of those conditions) set forth in _Article VI_, unless another
time or date is agreed to by the parties hereto. The Closing will be held at
the offices of Jones Day, 901 Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, or such
other location to which the parties hereto agree in writing. The date on which
the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the _"Closing Date_. _"_
_"Business Day"_ means any day other than Saturday, Sunday or any day on
which banking and savings and loan institutions are authorized or required by
Law to be closed.

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, (i) as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the
parties shall file a certificate of merger (the _"Certificate of Merger"_ )
in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and the terms of this Agreement and (ii) as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, the parties shall make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger will become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date, or at such
subsequent date or time as the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes
effective is hereinafter referred to as the _"Effective Time"_ ).

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will be vested in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws_.

(a) Subject to _Section 5.5_, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of
the Company (the _"Company Charter"_ ) shall be amended at the Effective Time
to be in the form of the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time, and, as so amended, such Company
Charter shall be the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

(b) Subject to _Section 5.5_, the by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time, will be the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law.



 

2 Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their death,
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation,
until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

Section 1.7 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the
Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, and any comparable provisions of applicable state or local
Law. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the Treasury Regulations, and for all relevant
tax purposes.

Section 1.8 _Restructuring_. At the election of Parent or the Company, if in
their reasonable good faith opinion, such action is necessary to cause the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(d)_ or  _Section 6.3(d)_ to be
satisfied, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate to (i)
restructure the Merger so that the Company shall be merged with and into
Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the Surviving Corporation and/or
(ii) convert Merger Sub into a limited liability company prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , that neither Parent nor the Company shall be
deemed to have breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement by reason of such election.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT

CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENT

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Sub s Common Stock_. Each share of Merger Subs common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent or any direct or indirect
subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
and any Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time will automatically be canceled and retired and
will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange
therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.2(e)_, each
issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and
Dissenting Shares, will be  



 

3  converted into the right to receive (i) $22.23 in cash (the " _Cash
Consideration_ ") without interest and (ii) a number of validly issued, fully
paid, nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio
(the " _Stock Consideration_ "). The Cash Consideration, the Stock
Consideration, and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
as contemplated by _Section 2.2(e)_ are referred to collectively as the "
_Merger Consideration_ ".

(d) _Cancellation of Shares of Company Common Stock_. As of the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Common Stock, other than Dissenting Shares, shall
no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate formerly representing
any shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Certificate_ ") or book entry
shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, certain
dividends or other distributions, if any, upon surrender of such Company
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, in each case, in accordance with this
_Article II_ , without interest.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a
national bank or trust company, that is reasonably satisfactory to
the Company, to act as agent of Parent for purposes of, among other things,
mailing and receiving transmittal letters and distributing the Merger
Consideration to the Company stockholders (the _"Exchange Agent"_ ). Parent
and the Exchange Agent shall enter into an agreement which will provide that
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent as of the Effective Time, for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this  _Article II_, through the Exchange Agent, (i)
immediately available funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration
and (ii) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock (such
cash and such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the Effective Time
and any cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock,
being hereinafter referred to as the  _"Exchange Fund"_ ) issuable pursuant
to _Section 2.1_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event within 5 Business Days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Company Certificate or Book-Entry
Share whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal (which will
specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Company Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company
Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and such
letter of transmittal will be in customary form and have such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify consistent with this Agreement) and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates
or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares
in exchange for the Merger Consideration.



 

4 (ii) After the Effective Time, and upon surrender in accordance with _this
Article II_ of a Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares will be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration in the form of (A) a
certificate or book-entry share representing that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_ , after taking into account all the shares of
Company Common Stock then held by such holder under all such Book-Entry Shares
or Company Certificates so surrendered and (B) a check for the full amount of
cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_, including the Cash Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares, certain dividends or other distributions, if any, in
accordance with _Section 2.2(c),_ and the Company Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered will forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be issued to a person other than
the person in whose name the Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered is registered (the _"Transferee_ ") if such Company Certificate
or Book-Entry Share is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer and the Transferee pays any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of such payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or establishes to the satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_, each Company
Certificate and each Book-Entry Share will be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to receive in
respect of such Company Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_ and certain dividends or other distributions, if any, in
accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_. No interest will be paid or will accrue on
any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

(c) _Dividends; Other Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares will be
paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_, and all such dividends,
other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock will be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and will be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such
Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this _Article II_.
Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar Laws, following
surrender of any such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance
herewith, there will be paid to the holder of the certificate representing
whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, in addition to all other amounts to which such holder is entitled
under this _Article II_ (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ and (ii)
at the  



 

5  appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and
with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued and all Cash Consideration paid upon the surrender
for exchange of Company Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and
_Section 2.2(e)_) will be deemed to have been issued or paid, as the case may
be, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock theretofore represented by such Company Certificates and such
Book-Entry Shares, and there will be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, they will be canceled and exchanged as provided in this  _Article
II_.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_.

(i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock will be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of Parent will relate to
such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder
of Parent.

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the
Effective Time by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in
cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent and without interest) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which
such former holder would otherwise be entitled (rounded up to the nearest
ten thousandth when expressed in decimal form) by (B) the closing price for a
share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions
Reports (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ , or, if not reported
thereby, any other authoritative source) on the Closing Date or, if such date
is not a trading day, the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date
(the " _Closing Price_ ").

(iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such
amounts to such holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock subject to and in
accordance with the terms of _Section 2.2(c)_.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Company Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for twelve months after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who
have not theretofore complied with  



 

6  this _Article II_ may thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their
claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions, if any,
with respect to Parent Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent will be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent Common
Stock, any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any cash from the Exchange
Fund, in each case, delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, on a daily basis,
_provided_ , _that_ , (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect
the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America with maturities of no more than
30 days, or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose,
except as provided in this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments will be paid to Parent.

(i)  _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Certificate, the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, any unpaid
dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in
respect thereof and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, in each case, due to such person pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.3 _Certain Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock, or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of capital stock, of the Company
or Parent shall occur as a result of any merger, business combination,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_  that nothing in this
_Section 2.3_ shall be construed to permit either the Company or Parent to
take any action with respect to its respective securities that is prohibited
or not expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement. 

Section 2.4 _Dissenters  Rights_. Shares of Company Common Stock that have
not been voted for adoption of this Agreement and with respect to which
appraisal has been properly demanded in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL ( _"Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration at or after the Effective Time unless and until the
holder of such shares (a _"Dissenting Stockholder_ ") withdraws such demand
for such appraisal (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or becomes
ineligible for  



 

7  such appraisal. If a holder of Dissenting Shares withdraws such demand for
appraisal (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or
becomes ineligible for such appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time or the
occurrence of such event, whichever last occurs, each of such holders
Dissenting Shares will cease to be a Dissenting Share and will be converted as
of the Effective Time into and represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments received by the Company relating to stockholders
rights of appraisal, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands except as required
by applicable Law. The Company shall not, except with prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, unless and to the extent required to do so under applicable Law.

Section 2.5 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Section 2.6 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
person such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such amounts withheld shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.
Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts so withheld to the
appropriate taxing authority within the period required under applicable Law.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Section 3.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Subject only to
those exceptions and qualifications listed and described (including an
identification by section reference to the representations and warranties to
which such exceptions and qualifications relate) on the disclosure letter
delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the  _"Company Disclosure Letter"_ ), provided, however, that a matter
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to one representation
or warranty shall also be deemed to be disclosed with respect to each
other representation or warranty to the extent it is reasonably apparent from
the text of such disclosure that such disclosure applies to or qualifies such
other representation or warranty, and except as set forth in the Recent SEC
Reports, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
as follows:



 

8 (a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. The Company and each of the
Company Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
organized and has the requisite corporate authority to carry on its business
as now being conducted. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be
in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. The
Company has made available to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement
complete and correct copies of the Company Charter and the bylaws of the
Company, each as amended to date.

(b) _Subsidiaries_. All outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
equity interests in, each subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the
_"Company Subsidiaries_ " and, together with the Company, the _"Company
Entities_ ") (i) have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable, (ii) are free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens
and (iii) are free of any other restriction (including any restriction on the
right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other
ownership interests). All outstanding shares of capital stock (or equivalent
equity interests of entities other than corporations) of each of the Company
Subsidiaries are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company.
The Company does not, directly or indirectly, own more than 20% but less than
100% of the capital stock or other equity interest in any person other than
the Company Subsidiaries.

(c) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
entirely of (i) 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii)
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. At the close

were issued and outstanding (including 962,214 shares of unvested restricted
stock); (ii) no shares of Company Common Stock were held by the Company in its
treasury; (iii) 6,086,130 shares of Company Common Stock were issuable under
the Alpha Coal Management LLC Amended and Restated 2004 Long-Term Incentive

Term Incentive Plan as Amended and Restated as of May 14, 2008 (the _"2005
LTIP"_ and, together with the ACM 2004 LTIP, the _"Company Stock Plans"_ and
such stock options collectively, the _"Company Stock Options_ "); and (iv) up
to 977,320 shares of the Company Common Stock were subject to issued and
outstanding performance share grants under the Company Stock Plans. The
Company has made available to Parent a list, as of the close of business on
July 11, 2008, of the holders of outstanding Company Stock Options, restricted
shares, and performance shares or units, and the number of shares
outstanding, the number of shares exercisable (with respect to the Company
Stock Options), the vesting schedule and other forfeiture provision (with
respect to restricted shares and performance shares or units) and the
exercise price, as applicable, subject to each such equity award. As of the
close of business on July 14, 2008, the total number of votes entitled to be
cast at the Company Stockholders Meeting with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby is 70,494,861. All outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company are, and all shares that may be issued will be,
when issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
not subject to or issued in violation of preemptive rights. Except as  



 

9  otherwise provided in this _Section 3.1(c)_, there are not issued, reserved
for issuance or outstanding (i) any shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of the Company, (ii) any securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital stock or voting securities
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or (iii) any warrants, calls,
options or other rights to acquire from the Company or any Company Subsidiary

Company or any Company Subsidiary. Except as otherwise provided in this
_Section 3.1(c)_, there are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to (i) issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, any capital stock, voting securities or securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or voting
securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (ii) repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any such securities. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is a party to any voting agreement with respect to the voting of
any such securities. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 3.1(c)_,
there are no agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character (contingent or otherwise) pursuant to which any person is or may be
entitled to receive from the Company or a Company Subsidiary any payment based
on the revenues, earnings or financial performance of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or assets or calculated in accordance therewith.

(d) _Authority; Noncontravention_. The Company has all requisite corporate
power and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to the Company
Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company,
subject, in the case of the Merger, to the Company Stockholder Approval. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as
the enforcement thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws generally affecting the rights of
creditors and subject to general equity principles. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement will not, (i) conflict with the certificate of incorporation or by-
laws (or comparable organizational documents) of any of the Company Entities,
(ii) assuming that all the consents, approvals and filings referred to in the
next sentence are duly obtained and/or made, (A) result in any breach,
violation or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or creation or
acceleration of any obligation or right of a third party or loss of a benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or
assets of any of the Company Entities under, any loan or credit agreement,
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, instrument, permit,
concession, franchise, license or other authorization applicable to any of the
Company Entities or their respective properties or assets are bound or (B)
conflict with or violate any judgment, order, decree or Law applicable to any
of the Company Entities or their respective properties or assets, other than,
in the case of clause (ii)(A) and (B) and (iii) any such conflicts, breaches,
violations, defaults, rights, losses or Liens that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material
adverse effect on the Company. No consent, approval, order or authorization
of, action by or in respect of, or  



 

10  registration, declaration or filing with, any federal, state or local or
foreign government, any court, administrative, regulatory or other
governmental agency, commission or authority or any non-governmental United
States or foreign self-regulatory agency, commission or authority or any
arbitral tribunal (each, a _"Governmental Entity_ ") or any third party is
required by the Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except for: (i) the filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the  _"SEC_ ") of (A) a proxy

Stockholders Meeting, as amended or supplemented from time to time, the
_"Joint Proxy Statement_ ") and (B) such reports under Section 13(a), 13(d),
15(d) or 16(a) or such other applicable sections of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the  _"Exchange Act_ "), as may be required in

connection with mining, reclamation and environmental Permits, in each case
under the applicable Laws of Alabama, Michigan, Kentucky, Virginia, Minnesota,
West Virginia, Pennsylvania, United States, Australia, and Canada, and (vi)
such consents, approvals, orders or authorizations the failure of which to be
made or obtained, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company.

(e) _SEC Reports and Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities; Internal
Controls_.

(i) The Company has timely filed all required reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including exhibits and all other information
incorporated therein) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
_"Securities Act_ ") and the Exchange Act with the SEC since December 31, 2006
(as such reports, schedules, forms, statements and documents have been
amended since the time of their filing, collectively, the _"Company SEC
Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, or if amended prior to the date
of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, the Company SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC
Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents when filed, or as so
amended, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC
staff.

(ii) The financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC
Documents, comply as to form, as of their respective date of filing with the
SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and  



 

11  regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (
_"GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form
10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and on that basis fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
statements of income, cash flows and stockholders equity for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal recurring
year-end audit adjustments). No Company Subsidiary is required to make any
filings with the SEC. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed
since December 31, 2007 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the _"Recent
SEC Reports_ "), since December 31, 2007, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have not incurred any liabilities (direct, contingent or
otherwise), that are of a nature that would be required to be disclosed on a
balance sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or the footnotes
thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than (A) liabilities incurred
in the ordinary course of business and (B) liabilities that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a
material adverse effect on the Company.

(iii) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under
means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their accountants
(including all means of access thereto and therefrom) except for any non-
exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the system of
internal accounting controls described in the following sentence. As and to
the extent described in the Company SEC Documents, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
in accordance with GAAP. The Company (A) has implemented and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) of the
Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the
management of the Company by others within those entities, and (B) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Companys Board of
Directors (1) any significant deficiencies or material weakness in the design
or operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and (2) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal controls. The Company has made available to
Parent a summary of any such disclosure made by Company management to the
Companys auditors or audit committee of the Companys Board of
Directors since December 31, 2007.

(f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
(i) the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by Parent
in connection with the issuance of  



 

12  Parent Common Stock in the Merger (the _"Form S-4_ ") will, at the time the
Form S-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or (ii) the
Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys
stockholders and Parents stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The
Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder,
except that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect
to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

(g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except for liabilities incurred in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, since
December 31, 2007, (i) each of the Company Entities has conducted its
respective operations only in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice, (ii) there has not been any event, circumstance, change, occurrence
or state of facts that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and
(iii) none of the Company Entities has taken any action that if taken after
the date of this Agreement would constitute a violation of _Section 4.1(a)_
(other than  _Sections 4.1(a)(i),(ii)_ and _(iii)(A)_ ).

(h) _Compliance with Applicable Laws; Litigation_.

(i) The operations of the Company Entities have not been since January 1, 2006
and are not being conducted in violation of any Law (including the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001) or any Permit necessary for
the conduct of their respective businesses as currently conducted, except
where such violations, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company.
None of the Company Entities has received any written notice, or has knowledge
of any claim, alleging any such violation.

(ii) The Company Entities hold all licenses, permits, variances, consents,
authorizations, waivers, grants, franchises, concessions, exemptions, orders,
registrations and approvals of Governmental Entities or other persons (
_"Permits_ ") necessary for the conduct of their respective businesses as
currently conducted, except where the failure to hold such Permits,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or
result in a material adverse effect on the Company. None of the Company
Entities has received written notice that any such Permit will be terminated
or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of business, and the
Company has no knowledge of any reasonable basis for any such termination,
modification or nonrenewal, except for such terminations, modifications or
nonrenewals as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby do not  



 

13  and will not violate any such Permit, or result in any termination,
modification or nonrenewals thereof, except for such violations,
terminations, modifications or nonrenewals thereof as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material
adverse effect on the Company.

(iii) There is no suit, action or proceeding by or before any Governmental
Entity pending (or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened), except for
any such suit, action or proceeding that challenges or seeks to prohibit the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or against the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any
of their properties or assets that would reasonably be expected to have or
result in a material adverse effect on the Company. As of the date hereof,
there is no suit, action or proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company
or any Company Subsidiary challenging or seeking to prohibit the execution,
delivery or performance this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(i) _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(i) The Company has made available to Parent a true and complete list of (A)
each material bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation,
incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option, equity
compensation, retirement, vacation, employment, disability, death benefit,
hospitalization, medical insurance, life insurance, welfare, severance or
other employee benefit plan, agreement, arrangement or understanding
maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary contributes or is obligated to contribute with respect
to its employees, and (B) each change of control agreement providing benefits
to any current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party
or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound (collectively, the
_"Company Benefit Plans_ "). With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, no
event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of circumstances in
connection with which the Company or any Company Subsidiary could be subject
to any liability that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability (including
contingent liability) with respect to any plan, agreement, arrangement or
understanding of the type described in this paragraph other than the Company
Benefit Plans, other than liability that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse
effect on the Company.

(ii) Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with its
terms, all applicable Laws, including the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended ( _"ERISA_ "), and the Code, and the terms of all
applicable collective bargaining agreements, except for any failures so to
administer any Company Benefit Plan that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse
effect on the Company. The Company and all Company Benefit Plans are in
compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the  



 

14  Code and all other applicable Laws and the terms of all applicable
collective bargaining agreements, except for any failures to be in such
compliance that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. Each
Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a),
401(k) or 4975(e)(7) of the Code has received a favorable determination
letter from the IRS as to its qualified status and, to the knowledge of the
Company, there exist no facts or circumstances that have caused or could cause
a failure to be so qualified under Section 401(a), 401(k) or 4975(e)(7) of
the Code. No fact or event has occurred which is reasonably likely to affect
adversely the qualified status of any such Company Benefit Plan or the exempt
status of any such trust, except for any occurrence that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a
material adverse effect on the Company. All contributions to, and payments
from, the Company Benefit Plans that are required to have been made in
accordance with such Company Benefit Plans, ERISA or the Code have been
timely made other than any failures that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse
effect on the Company. All trusts providing funding for Company Benefit Plans
that are intended to comply with Section 501(c)(9) of the Code are exempt from
federal income taxation and, together with any other welfare benefit funds (as
defined in Section 419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained in connection with any
of the Company Benefit Plans, have been operated and administered in
compliance with all applicable requirements such that neither the Company, any
Company Subsidiary, any Company Benefit Plan nor such trust or fund is
subject to any taxes, penalties or other liabilities imposed as a consequence
of failure to comply with such requirements, other than any liability that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or
result in a material adverse effect on the Company. No welfare benefit fund
(as defined in Section 419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained in connection with
any of the Company Benefit Plans has provided any "disqualified benefit" (as
defined in Section 4976(b)(1) of the Code) for which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has or had any liability for the excise tax imposed by
Section 4976 of the Code which has not been paid in full, other than any
liability that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company.

(iii) Other than as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a
material adverse effect on the Company, neither the Company nor any trade or
business, whether or not incorporated, which, together with the Company, would
be deemed to be a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of
ERISA or Section 414(b) or 414(c) of the Code (a _"Company ERISA Affiliate"_ )
has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than for premiums
pursuant to Section 4007 of ERISA which have been timely paid) or Section 4971
of the Code, and no condition exists that presents a risk to the Company or
any Company ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability or failure. None
of the Company Benefit Plans (other than Multiemployer Plans) are defined
benefit plans within the meaning of ERISA or subject to the minimum funding
requirements of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.

(iv) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a
material adverse effect on the Company, no Company Benefit Plan provides
medical or  



 

15  life insurance benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to current or
former employees or officers or directors after retirement or other
termination of service, other than any such coverage required by Law, and the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries have reserved all rights necessary to
amend or terminate each of the Company Benefit Plans without the consent of
any other person.

(v) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, either alone or in combination with another event, (A) entitle any
current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment,
except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (B) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such
employee, officer or director.

(vi) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any
agreement, contract or arrangement (including this Agreement) that could
result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. No
Company Benefit Plan provides for the reimbursement of excise taxes under
Section 4999 of the Code or any income taxes under the Code.

(vii) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has delivered or
made available to Parent a true and complete copy of: (A) each writing
constituting a part of such Company Benefit Plan, including all Company
Benefit Plan documents and trust agreements; (B) the most recent Annual
Reports (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedules, if any; (C) the most
recent annual financial report, if any; (D) the most recent actuarial report,
if any; and (E) the most recent determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service, if any. Except as specifically provided in the foregoing
documents delivered or made available to Parent or in Section 3.1(i)(v) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no material amendments to any Company
Benefit Plan that have been adopted or approved nor has the Company or any
Company Subsidiary undertaken to make any such material amendments or to
adopt or approve any new Company Benefit Plan.

(viii) No Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan (as defined in Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a _"Multiemployer Plan"_ ) or a plan that has two or
more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan"_ ).
Other than as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material
adverse effect on the Company, none of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Company ERISA Affiliates has, at any
time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute
to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan. None of the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Company ERISA Affiliates has
incurred any material withdrawal liability under a Multiemployer Plan that has
not been satisfied in full, nor does the Company have any material contingent
liability with respect to any withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan. None of
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Company
ERISA Affiliates would incur any material withdrawal liability (within the
meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle E of Title I of ERISA) if the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective  



 

16  Company ERISA Affiliates withdrew (within the meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle
E of Title I of ERISA) on or prior to the Closing Date from each
Multiemployer Plan to which the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Company ERISA Affiliates has an obligation to contribute on
the date of this Agreement. To the knowledge of the Company, no Multiemployer
Plan to which the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Company ERISA Affiliates contributes or otherwise has any liability
(contingent or otherwise) has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency
within the meaning of Section 431(a) of the Code or Section 304(a) of ERISA,
is insolvent, is in reorganization (within the meaning of Section 4241 of
ERISA), is reasonably likely to commence reorganization, is in "endangered" or
"critical" status (as such terms are defined in Section 432 of the Code) or
is reasonably likely to be in endangered or critical status.

(ix) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been
asserted or instituted, or to the Companys knowledge, no set of circumstances
exists that may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the
Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to
the Company Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the
Company Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the
United States Department of Treasury, the United States Department of Labor,
any Multiemployer Plan, any Company Benefit Plan, any participant in a
Company Benefit Plan, any employee benefit plan with respect to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary has any contingent liability, or any
participant in an employee benefit plan with respect to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary has any contingent liability other than any liability
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company.

(x) To the knowledge of the Company, there have been no prohibited
transactions or breaches of any of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries"
(within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the
Company Benefit Plans that could result in any liability or excise tax under
ERISA or the Code being imposed on the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, other than any liability that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse
effect on the Company.

(xi) All contributions, transfers and payments in respect of any Company
Benefit Plan, other than transfers incident to an incentive stock option plan
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, have been or are fully
deductible under the Code, except as would not reasonably be expected to have
or result in a material adverse effect on the Company.

(xii) With respect to any insurance policy that has, or does, provide funding
for benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, to the knowledge of the Company
no insurance company issuing any such policy is in receivership,
conservatorship, liquidation or similar proceeding and, to the knowledge of
the Company, no such proceedings with respect to any insurer are imminent. 



 

17 (xiii) For purposes of this _Section 3.1(i)_ only, the term  _"employee"_
will be considered to include individuals rendering personal services to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary as independent contractors.

(j) _Taxes_. (i) Except as would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company,
the Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed all Tax Returns
required to be filed, and all such returns are true, correct, and complete;
(ii) the Company and each Company Subsidiary has paid all Taxes due whether or
not shown on any Tax Return, except, in the cases of (i) and (ii) hereof,
with respect to Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings; (iii) there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings in
respect of Taxes relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary; (iv) there
are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, other than Liens for Taxes not yet due and Liens for Taxes that
are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings; (v) neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes of any
person (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable provision of Law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise; (vi) neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any agreement or arrangement
relating to the allocation, sharing or indemnification of Taxes; (vii) neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has taken any action or knows of any
fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code; (viii) no deficiencies for any Taxes have been
proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary for which adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP have not been
created; (ix) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary will be required
to include any adjustment in taxable income for any Tax period ending after
the Closing Date (a  _"Post-Closing Tax Period"_ ) under Section 481(c) of
the Code (or any comparable provision of Law) as a result of a change in
method of accounting for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending prior to
the Closing Date (a _"Pre-Closing Tax Period"_ ) or pursuant to the
provisions of any agreement entered into with any taxing authority with regard
to the Tax liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period; (x) the financial statements included in the Company SEC
Documents reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with GAAP for all Taxes
for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary may be liable for all taxable
periods and portions thereof through the date hereof; (xi) no person has
granted any extension or waiver of the statute of limitations period
applicable to any Tax of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any
affiliated, combined or unitary group of which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is or was a member, which period (after giving effect to such
extension or waiver) has not yet expired, and there is no currently effective
"closing agreement" pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code (or any similar
provision of foreign, state or local Law); (xii) the Company and each Company
Subsidiary have withheld and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority all
Taxes required to have been withheld and remitted in connection with any
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,
stockholder, or other third party, and have complied in all material respects
with all applicable Laws relating to information reporting; (xiii) neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has distributed the stock of another
person or has had its stock distributed by another person, in a transaction
that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part by Section
355 or Section 361 of the Code; (xiv) neither the  



 

18  Company nor any Company Subsidiary has participated in any transaction that
has been identified by the Internal Revenue Service in any published guidance
as a "listed transaction" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4); and (xv) the consolidated federal income Tax Returns of the Company
have been examined, or the statute of limitations has closed, with respect to
all taxable years through and including 2003. As used in this Agreement,
_"Taxes"_ includes all federal, state or local or foreign net and gross

respect to any such taxes, charges, fees, levies or other assessments. As used
herein, _"Tax Return"_ shall mean any return, report, statement or
information required to be filed with any Governmental Entity with respect to

Company, the Company Entities are and have been for the past three years in

(ii) There are no written Environmental, Health and Safety Claims pending or,

or arising from Environmental, Health and Safety Laws, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the
Company.

(viii) There exist no Environmental Conditions relating to any currently or

Leased Real Property"_ and, together with the Company Owned Real Property, the
_"Company Real Property"_ ) constitute all of the real property occupied or
used by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the
operation of their respective businesses as currently conducted. The Company
or a Company Subsidiary has a valid leasehold interest in or valid rights to
all material Company Leased Real Property. The Company has made available to
Parent true and complete copies of all material leases of the Company Leased
Real Property (the _"Company Leases"_ ). No option, extension or renewal has

properties, assets and rights are in all material respects adequate for the
purposes for which such assets are currently used or held for use, and are

expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company.

to the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor the Company
Subsidiaries nor the conduct of their respective businesses has infringed,
misappropriated or otherwise conflicted with any intellectual property rights
or other rights of any third parties and neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries is aware of any infringement, misappropriation or
conflict which will occur as a result of the continued operation of
the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries respective businesses as
currently conducted, except, with respect to clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D), as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on the Company.

(iii) (A) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement will have no
material adverse effect on the right, title and interest of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries in and to the Company Intellectual Property; and (B)

all necessary action to maintain and protect the material Company
Intellectual Property and, until the Effective Time, shall continue to
maintain and protect the material Company Intellectual Property.

(n) _Labor Agreements and Employee Issues_. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have made available to Parent all collective
bargaining agreements or other agreements with any union or labor
organization to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a
party. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in material compliance
with each such collective bargaining agreement or other agreement. The
Company is unaware of any effort, activity or proceeding of any labor
organization (or representative thereof) to organize any other of its or their
employees. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are not, and have not
since December 31, 2006, been subject to any pending, or to the knowledge of
the  



 

23  Company, threatened (i) unfair labor practice charges and/or complaint, (ii)
grievance proceeding or arbitration proceeding arising under any collective

of which any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries is or may be entitled to claim indemnification from
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse
effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiaries is a
party to, or is otherwise bound by, any consent decree with any Governmental
Entity relating to employees or employment practices of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries.

(o) _Certain Contracts_. _Schedule 3.1(o)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a true and correct list of each contract, arrangement, commitment
or understanding to which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is a party to or
is bound (i) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC); (ii) that contains covenants that
limit the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or which,
following the consummation of the Merger, could restrict the ability of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates) to compete in any business or
with any person or in any geographic area or distribution or sales channel, or
to sell, supply or distribute any service or product, in each case, that could
reasonably be expected to be material to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) pursuant to which the Company and its
Subsidiaries expect to pay or receive payments in excess of $100 million
during the 12 month period following the date hereof; or (iv) which would
prohibit or delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (each of the foregoing, a _"Company Material Contract"_ ). Each
Company Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company and any Company
Subsidiary that is a party thereto and, to the knowledge of the Company, each
other party thereto and is in full force and effect. There is no default under
any Company Material Contract by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or,
to the knowledge of the Company, by any other party, and no event has occurred
that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a
default thereunder by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the
knowledge of the Company, by any other party, in each case except as would not
reasonably be expected to have or result in, individually or in the aggregate,
a material adverse effect on the Company. All contracts, agreements,
arrangements or understandings of any kind between any affiliate of the
Company (other than any wholly owned Company Subsidiary), on the one hand, and
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, are on terms no
less favorable to the Company or to such Company Subsidiary than would be
obtained with an unaffiliated third party on an arms-length basis.

(p) _Insurance_. _Section 3.1(p) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ contains a
list of all material insurance policies that are owned by the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries or which names the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries as an insured (or loss payee), including those which pertain to
the Companys or any of the Company Subsidiaries assets, employees or
operations. All such insurance policies are in full force and effect, are in
such amounts and cover such losses and risks as are consistent with industry
 



 

24  practice and, in the reasonable judgment of senior management of the
Company, are adequate to protect the properties and businesses of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and all premiums due thereunder have been paid.
Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is in material breach
or default under, or has received notice of cancellation of, any such
insurance policies.

 

(q) _Interested Party Transactions_. No event has occurred since December 31,
2007 that would be required to be reported by the Company pursuant to Item

(r) _Voting Requirement_. The affirmative vote at the Company Stockholders
Meeting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders
of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to adopt this Agreement is the
only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Companys capital
stock necessary to adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the _"Company Stockholder
Approval"_ ).

(s) _State Takeover Statutes_. The Board of Directors of the Company has taken
all necessary action so that no "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other anti-takeover Law (each, a _"Takeover Statute"_ )
(including the interested stockholder provisions codified in Section 203 of
the DGCL) or any anti-takeover provision in the Company Charter or the

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Board of Directors of the
Company has (i) duly and validly approved this Agreement, (ii) determined
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and (iii) resolved to
recommend to such stockholders that they vote in favor of the Merger, subject

(u) _Brokers_. Except for Citigroup Global Markets Inc., no broker, investment
banker, financial advisor or other person is entitled to any brokers,
finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of the Company. The Company has furnished to Parent true
and complete copies of all agreements under which any such fees, commissions

Agreement, of the persons to whom such fees, commissions or expenses are
payable.

Section 3.2 _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_. Subject
only to those exceptions and qualifications listed and described (including an
identification by section reference to the representations and warranties to
which such exceptions and qualifications relate) on the disclosure letter
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company prior to the execution of
this Agreement (the _"Parent Disclosure Letter"_ ),  _provided_ , however,
that a matter disclosed in the Parent Disclosure Letter with respect to one  



 

25  representation or warranty shall also be deemed to be disclosed with respect
to each other representation or warranty to the extent it is reasonably
apparent from the text of such disclosure that such disclosure applies to or
qualifies such other representation or warranty, and except as set forth in
the Recent Parent SEC Reports, each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents
and warrants to the Company as follows:

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate
authority to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on
Parent. Parent has made available to the Company prior to the execution of
this Agreement complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation
and the bylaws of Parent and Merger Sub, each as amended to date.

(b) _Subsidiaries_. All outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
equity interests in, each subsidiary of Parent (collectively, the _"Parent
Subsidiaries"_ and, together with Parent, the _"Parent Entities"_ ) (i) have
been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, (ii) are free and
clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens and (iii) are free of any other
restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise
dispose of such capital stock or other ownership interests). All outstanding
shares of capital stock (or equivalent equity interests of entities other
than corporations) of each of the Parent Subsidiaries are beneficially owned,
directly or indirectly, by Parent. Parent does not, directly or indirectly,
own more than 20% but less than 100% of the capital stock or other equity
interest in any person other than the Parent Subsidiaries.

(c) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists
entirely of (i) 224,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) 7,000,000
shares of preferred stock of Parent, of which (x) 3,000,000 shares have been
designated as Serial Preferred Stock, Class A, without par value, of which
172,500 shares have been designated as 3.25% Redeemable Cumulative Convertible
Perpetual Preferred Stock ( _"Series A-2 Preferred Stock"_ ), and (y)
4,000,000 shares have been designated as Serial Preferred Stock, Class B,
without par value. At the close of business on July 14, 2008: (i) 104,145,300
shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding (including 1,936,799
shares of restricted stock); (ii) 30,478,228 shares of Parent Common Stock
were held by Parent in its treasury; (iii) 19,555 shares of Series A-2
Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of Parent Common
Stock were reserved for issuance in connection with the conversion of the
Series A-2 Preferred Stock; and (iv) no shares of Parent Common Stock were
subject to issued and outstanding options to purchase Parent Common Stock
granted under Parents 2007 Incentive Equity Plan (the  _"2007 Incentive
Plan"_ ), Parents 1992 Incentive Equity Plan, as amended (the _"1992 IEP"_ ),
Parents 1996 Nonemployee Directors Compensation Plan, as amended and
restated (the  _"1996 Directors  Plan"_), Parents Nonemployee Directors
Deferred Compensation Plan (the _"Directors  DCP"_), and Parents Long-Term
Incentive Program (the _"Parent LTIP"_ and,  



 

26  together with the 2007 Incentive Plan, the 1992 IEP, the 1996 Directors
Plan, the Directors DCP, and the Parent LTIP, the  _"Parent Stock Plans"_
and such stock options, collectively the _"Parent Stock Options"_ ). Parent
has made available to the Company a list, as of the close of business on July
14, 2008, of the number of performance share grants issued for the 2006-2008,
2007-2009 and 2008-2010 performance periods. The shares of Series A-2
Preferred Stock that are issued and outstanding are entitled to vote on the
Merger together with the Parent Common Stock, as a single class and each
share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote thereon. As of the
close of business on July 14, 2008, each share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock
is currently convertible into 133.0646 shares of Parent Common Stock at a
conversion price of $7.52 per share of Parent Common Stock. As of July 14,
2008, the total number of votes entitled to be cast at the Parent Stockholders
Meeting with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby is
104,164,855. All outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent are, and all
shares that may be issued will be, when issued, duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation
of preemptive rights. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 3.2(c)_,
there are not issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding (i) any shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of Parent, (ii) any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital stock
or voting securities of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or (iii) any
warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary any capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or voting securities of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
3.2(c)_, there are no outstanding obligations of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary to (i) issue, deliver or sell, or caused to be issued, delivered or
sold, any capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or voting securities of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or (ii) repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any such securities. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a
party to any voting agreement with respect to the voting of any such
securities. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 3.2(c)_, there are
no agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character (contingent or
otherwise) pursuant to which any person is or may be entitled to receive from
Parent or a Parent Subsidiary any payment based on the revenues, earnings or
financial performance of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or assets or
calculated in accordance therewith.

(d) _Authority; Noncontravention_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and,
subject to the Parent Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, respectively, subject
to the Parent Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against
Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement
thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws generally affecting the rights of creditors and
subject to general equity principles. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not,
(i) conflict with the articles of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable  



 

27  organizational documents) of any of the Parent Entities, (ii) assuming that
all the consents, approvals and filings referred to in the next sentence
are duly obtained and/or made, (A) result in any breach, violation or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or creation or acceleration of any
obligation or loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub under any loan or
credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement,
instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license or other authorization
applicable to any of the Parent Entities or by which their respective
properties or assets are bound, or (B) conflict with or violate any judgment,
order, decree or Law applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
properties or assets, other than, in the case of clause (ii) (A) and (B) and
(iii) any such conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults, rights, losses or
Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. No consent,
approval, order or authorization of, action by or in respect of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or third
party is required by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub or the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for: (i)
the filing with the SEC of (A) the Form S-4 and a proxy statement/prospectus
relating to the Parent Stockholders Meeting and (B) such reports under Section
13(a), 13(d), 15(d) or 16(a) or such other applicable sections of the Exchange
Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; (iii) the filing of a premerger
notification and report form by Parent under the HSR Act; (iv) filings with
and approvals of the NYSE to permit the shares of Parent Common Stock that are
to be issued in the Merger to be listed on the NYSE; (v) such governmental
consents, qualifications or filings as are customarily obtained or made in
connection with the transfer of interests or the change of control of
ownership in properties used for the mining, processing or shipping of coal or
iron ore, including notices and consents relating to or in connection with
mining, reclamation and environmental Permits, in each case under the
applicable Laws of Alabama, Michigan, Kentucky, Virginia, Minnesota, West
Virginia, Pennsylvania, United States, Australia, and Canada, and (vi)
such consents, approvals, orders or authorizations the failure of which to be
made or obtained, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent.

(e) _SEC Reports and Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities; Internal
Controls_.

(i) Parent has timely filed all required reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents (including exhibits and all other information
incorporated therein) under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with the
SEC since December 31, 2006 (as such reports, schedules, forms, statements and
documents have been amended since the time of their filing, collectively, the
_"Parent SEC Documents"_ ). As of their respective dates, or if amended prior
to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, the
Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent
SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents when filed, or as so
amended, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material  



 

28  fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff.

(ii) The financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents,
comply as to form, as of their respective date of filing with the SEC, in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and on
that basis fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders equity for
the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal recurring year-end audit adjustments). No Parent Subsidiary is required
to make any filings with the SEC. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC
Documents filed since December 31, 2007 and prior to the date of this
Agreement (the _"Recent Parent SEC Reports"_ ), since December 31, 2007,
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have not incurred any liabilities (direct,
contingent or otherwise) that are of a nature that would be required to be
disclosed on a balance sheet of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries or the
footnotes thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than (A)
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and (B) liabilities
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent.

(iii) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or their accountants (including all
means of access thereto and therefrom) except for any non-exclusive ownership
and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have or result
in a material adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls
described in the following sentence. As and to the extent described in the
Parent SEC Documents, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Parent (A)
has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as required
by Rule 13a-15(a) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material
information relating to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is
made known to the management of Parent by others within those entities, and
(B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
hereof, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of Parents Board of
Directors (1) any significant deficiencies or material weakness in the design
or operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and (2) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal controls. Parent has made available to the Company
a summary of  



 

29  any such disclosure made by the Parent management to the Parents auditors
or audit committee of the Parents Board of Directors since December 31,
2007.

(f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date
it is first mailed to the Companys stockholders and Parents stockholders or
at the time of the Parent Stockholders Meeting or the Company Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation or
warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the Company
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement, as the case may be.

(g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except for liabilities incurred
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
since December 31, 2007, (i) each of the Parent Entities has conducted their
respective operations only in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice, (ii) there has not been any event, circumstance, change, occurrence
or state of facts that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent and, (iii)
none of the Parent Entities has taken any action that if taken after the date
of this Agreement would constitute a violation of _Section 4.1(b)_.

(h) _Compliance with Applicable Laws; Litigation_.

(i) The operations of the Parent Entities have not been since January 1, 2006
and are not being conducted in violation of any Law (including the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001) or any Permit necessary
for the conduct of their respective businesses as currently conducted, except
where such violations, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. None of
the Parent Entities has received any written notice, or has knowledge of any
claim, alleging any such violation.

(ii) The Parent Entities hold all Permits necessary for the conduct of their
respective businesses as currently conducted, except where the failure to hold
such Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. None of
the Parent Entities has received written notice that any such Permit will be
terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of
business, and Parent has no knowledge of any reasonable basis for any such
termination, modification or nonrenewal, except for such terminations,
modifications or nonrenewals as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on
Parent. The execution,  



 

30  delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not violate any such Permit,
or result in any termination, modification or nonrenewals thereof, except for
such violations, terminations, modifications or nonrenewals thereof as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or
result in a material adverse effect on Parent.

(iii) There is no suit, action or proceeding by or before any Governmental
Entity pending (or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened), except for any
such suit, action or proceeding that challenges or seeks to prohibit the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is
a party or against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any of their properties
or assets that would reasonably be expected to have or result in a material
adverse effect on Parent. As of the date hereof, there is no suit, action or
proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity pending or, to the knowledge
of Parent, threatened against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary challenging or
seeking to prohibit the execution, delivery or performance this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(i) _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(i) Parent has made available to the Company a true and complete list of (A)
each material bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation,
incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option, equity
compensation, retirement, vacation, employment, disability, death benefit,
hospitalization, medical insurance, life insurance, welfare, severance or
other employee benefit plan, agreement, arrangement or understanding
maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or to which Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary contributes or is obligated to contribute with respect to its
employees, and (B) each change of control agreement providing benefits to any
current employee, officer or director of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, to
which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party or by which Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary is bound (collectively, the _"Parent Benefit Plans"_ ).
With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan, no event has occurred and there
exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary could be subject to any liability that, individually or
in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have or result in a material
adverse effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any
liability (including contingent liability) with respect to any plan,
agreement, arrangement or understanding of the type described in this
paragraph other than the Parent Benefit Plans, other than liability that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or
result in a material adverse effect on the Parent.

(ii) Each Parent Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with its
terms, all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code, and the terms of
all applicable collective bargaining agreements, except for any failures so to
administer any Parent Benefit Plan that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse
effect on Parent. Parent and all Parent Benefit Plans are in compliance with
the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws and
the terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements, except for any
failures to be in such compliance that, individually or in the  



 

31  aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material
adverse effect on Parent. Each Parent Benefit Plan that is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a), 401(k) or 4975(e)(7) of the Code has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its qualified
status and, to the knowledge of Parent, there exist no facts or circumstances
that have caused or could cause a failure to be so qualified under Section
401(a), 401(k) or 4975(e)(7) of the Code. No fact or event has occurred which
is reasonably likely to affect adversely the qualified status of any such
Parent Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such trust, except for any
occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. All
contributions to, and payments from, the Parent Benefit Plans that are
required to have been made in accordance with such Parent Benefit Plans, ERISA
or the Code have been timely made other than any failures that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in
a material adverse effect on Parent. All trusts providing funding for Parent
Benefit Plans that are intended to comply with Section 501(c)(9) of the Code
are exempt from federal income taxation and, together with any other welfare
benefit funds (as defined in Section 419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained in
connection with any of the Parent Benefit Plans, have been operated and
administered in compliance with all applicable requirements such that neither
Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, any Parent Benefit Plan nor such trust or fund
is subject to any taxes, penalties or other liabilities imposed as a
consequence of failure to comply with such requirements, other than any
liability that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Parent. No
welfare benefit fund (as defined in Section 419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained
in connection with any of the Parent Benefit Plans has provided
any "disqualified benefit" (as defined in Section 4976(b)(1) of the Code) for
which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has or had any liability for the excise
tax imposed by Section 4976 of the Code which has not been paid in
full, other than any liability that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on
the Parent.

(iii) Other than as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a
material adverse effect on the Parent, neither Parent nor any trade or
business, whether or not incorporated, which, together with Parent, would be
deemed to be a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of
ERISA or Section 414(b) or 414(c) of the Code (a _"Parent ERISA Affiliate"_ )
has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than for premiums
pursuant to Section 4007 of ERISA which have been timely paid) or Section 4971
of the Code, and no condition exists that presents a risk to Parent or any
Parent ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability or failure. None of the
Parent Benefit Plans (other than Multiemployer Plans) are defined benefit
plans within the meaning of ERISA or subject to the minimum
funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.

(iv) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a
material adverse effect on the Parent, no Parent Benefit Plan provides medical
or life insurance benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to current or
former employees or officers or directors after retirement or
other termination of service, other than any such coverage required by Law,
and Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have reserved all  



 

32  rights necessary to amend or terminate each of the Parent Benefit Plans
without the consent of any other person.

(v) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, either alone or in combination with another event, (A) entitle any
current or former employee, officer or director of Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment,
except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (B) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such
employee, officer or director.

(vi) Neither the Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to any
agreement, contract or arrangement (including this Agreement) that could
result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. No Parent
Benefit Plan provides for the reimbursement of excise taxes under Section 4999
of the Code or any income taxes under the Code.

(vii) With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan, Parent has delivered or made
available to the Company a true and complete copy of: (A) Parent Benefit
Plan, including all Parent Benefit Plan documents and trust agreements; (B)
the most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedules,
if any; (C) the most recent annual financial report, if any; (D) the most
recent actuarial report, if any; and (E) the most recent determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service, if any. Except as specifically provided in
the foregoing documents delivered or made available to the Company or in the
Parent Disclosure Letter, there are no material amendments to any Parent
Benefit Plan that have been adopted or approved nor has Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary undertaken to make any such material amendments or to adopt or
approve any new Parent Benefit Plan.

(viii) No Parent Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer
Plan. None of the Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
Parent ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years,
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or
Multiple Employer Plan. None of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective Parent ERISA Affiliates has incurred any material withdrawal
liability under a Multiemployer Plan that has not been satisfied in full, nor
does Parent have any material contingent liability with respect to any
withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan. None of Parent, the Parent
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Parent ERISA Affiliates would incur
any material withdrawal liability (within the meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle E
of Title I of ERISA) if Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Parent ERISA Affiliates withdrew (within the meaning of Part 1 of
Subtitle E of Title I of ERISA) on or prior to the Closing Date from each
Multiemployer Plan to which Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Parent ERISA Affiliates has an obligation to contribute on the date
of this Agreement. To the knowledge of the Parent, no Multiemployer Plan to
which Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any of their respective Parent ERISA
Affiliates contributes or otherwise has any liability (contingent or
otherwise) has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning
of Section 431(a) of the Code or Section 304(a) of ERISA, is insolvent, is
in reorganization (within the meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA), is  



 

33  reasonably likely to commence reorganization, is in "endangered" or
"critical" status (as such terms are defined in Section 432 of the Code) or
is reasonably likely to be in endangered or critical status.

(ix) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been

closed, with respect to all taxable years through and including 2003.

(k) _Environmental Matters_.

(i) Except where noncompliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not

compliance with all applicable Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and

35 (ii) There are no written Environmental, Health and Safety Claims pending or,
to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of Parent, there are no existing conditions,
circumstances or facts which could give rise to an Environmental, Health and

or result in a material adverse effect on Parent.

(iii) Parent has made available to the Company all material information,
including such studies, reports, correspondence, notices of violation,

used, handled or manufactured at, or transported, shipped or disposed of from,

listed on the National Priorities List, the Comprehensive Environmental

pursuant to any Environmental, Health and Safety Law, including any so-called

(viii) There exist no Environmental Conditions relating to any currently or
previously owned, leased, operated or otherwise used properties which,

(l) _Real Property; Assets_.

(i) The Parent or a Parent Subsidiary has good and marketable title to
each parcel of or interest in real property owned by Parent or a Parent
Subsidiary (the _"Parent Owned Real Property"_ ).

(ii) The Parent Owned Real Property and all real property interests leased or
otherwise held by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries (the _"Parent Leased Real
Property"_ ) and, together with the Parent Owned Real Property, the _"Parent
Real Property_ ") constitute all of the real property occupied or used by
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries in connection with the operation of their
respective businesses as currently conducted. Parent or a Parent Subsidiary
has a valid leasehold interest in or valid rights to all material Parent
Leased Real Property. Parent has made available to the Company true and
complete copies of all material leases of the Parent Leased Real Property
(the _"Parent Leases"_ ). No option, extension or renewal has been exercised
under any Parent Lease except options, extensions or renewals that would not
have a material and adverse impact on Parents ability to conduct its mining
operations at any of its business units, whose exercise has been evidenced by
a written document, a true and complete copy of which has been made available
to the Company with the corresponding Parent Lease. Each of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects with the terms of
all Parent Leases to which it is a party and under which it is in occupancy,
and all such Parent Leases are in full force and effect. To the knowledge of
Parent, the lessors under the Parent Leases to which Parent or a Parent
Subsidiary is a party have complied in all material respects with the terms of
their respective Parent Leases. Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such Parent Leases,
except where a failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on
Parent.

(iii) None of the Parent Owned Real Property or Parent Leased Real Property is
subject to any Liens (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise),
except Permitted Liens.

(iv) (A) The Parent Entities have good and marketable title to all
properties, assets and rights relating to or used or held for use in
connection with the business of the Parent Entities and such properties,
assets and rights comprise all of the assets required for the conduct of the
business of the Parent Entities as now being conducted and (B) all such
properties, assets and rights are in all material respects adequate for the
purposes for which such assets are currently used or held for use, and are
serviceable and in reasonably good operating condition (subject to normal
wear and tear),  



 

37  except in each case where such failure would not reasonably be expected to
have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent.

(m) _Parent Intellectual Property_.

(i) The term _"Parent Intellectual Property"_ means all of the following that
is owned by, issued or licensed to Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or used
in the business of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries: (A) all patents,
trademarks, trade names, trade dress, assumed names, service marks, logos,
copyrights, Internet domain names and corporate names together with all
applications, registrations, renewals and all goodwill associated therewith;
(B) all trade secrets and confidential information (including customer lists,
know-how, formulae, manufacturing and production processes, research,
financial business information and marketing plans); (C)
information technologies (including software programs, data and related
documentation); and (D) other intellectual property rights and all copies and
tangible embodiments of any of the foregoing in whatever form or medium.

(ii) (A) Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries own and possess all right, title
and interest in and to, or have a valid and enforceable license to use, the
Parent Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of their respective
businesses as currently conducted; (B) no claim by any third party contesting
the validity, enforceability, use or ownership of any of the
Parent Intellectual Property has been made, is currently outstanding or is
threatened and, to the knowledge of Parent, there are no grounds for the same;
(C) neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries has received any written
notices of, or is aware of any facts which indicate a likelihood of, any
infringement or misappropriation by, or other conflict with, any third party
with respect to the Parent Intellectual Property; (D) to the knowledge of
Parent, neither Parent nor the Parent Subsidiaries nor the conduct of their
respective businesses has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise conflicted
with any intellectual property rights or other rights of any third parties and
neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is aware of any
infringement, misappropriation or conflict which will occur as a result of the
continued operation of Parents and the Parent Subsidiaries respective
businesses as currently conducted except, with respect to clauses (A),
(B), (C) and (D), as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Parent.

(iii) (A) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement will have no
material adverse effect on the right, title and interest of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries in and to the Parent Intellectual Property; and (B)
Parent or each of the Parent Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has taken all
necessary action to maintain and protect the material Parent Intellectual
Property.

(n) _Labor Agreements and Employee Issues_. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
have made available to the Company all collective bargaining agreements or
other agreements with any union or labor organization to which Parent or any
of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are
in material compliance with each such collective bargaining agreement or other
agreement. Parent is unaware of any effort, activity or proceeding of any
labor organization (or representative thereof) to organize any other  



 

38  of its or their employees. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are not
subject to any pending, or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened (i) unfair
labor practice charges and/or complaint, (ii) grievance proceeding or
arbitration proceeding arising under any collective bargaining agreement or
other labor agreement to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party,
(iii) claim, suit, action or governmental investigation relating to
employees, including discrimination, wrongful discharge, or violation of any
state and/or federal statute relating to employment practices, (iv) strike,
lockout or dispute, slowdown or work stoppage or (v) claim, suit, action or
governmental investigation, in respect of which any director, officer,
employee or agent of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries is or may be
entitled to claim indemnification from Parent or any Parent Subsidiary,
except for the foregoing which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on
Parent. Neither Parent nor the Parent Subsidiaries is a party to, or is
otherwise bound by, any consent decree with any Governmental Entity relating
to employees or employment practices of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries.

(o) _Certain Contracts_. _Schedule 3.2(o)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter
sets forth a true and correct list of each contract, arrangement, commitment
or understanding to which Parent or a Parent Subsidiary is a party to or
is bound (i) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (ii) that contains covenants that
limit the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or which, following
the consummation of the Merger, could restrict the ability of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Affiliates) to compete in any business or with any
person or in any geographic area or distribution or sales channel, or to sell,
supply or distribute any service or product, in each case, that could
reasonably be expected to be material to the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) pursuant to which Parent and its
Subsidiaries expect to pay or receive payments in excess of $100 million
during the 12 month period following the date hereof; or (iv) which would
prohibit or delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (each of the foregoing, a  _"Parent Material Contract"_ ).
Each Parent Material Contract is valid and binding on Parent and any Parent
Subsidiary that is a party thereto and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other
party thereto and is in full force and effect. There is no default under any
Parent Material Contract by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or, to the
knowledge of Parent, by any other party, and no event has occurred that with
the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default
thereunder by Parent or any of Parent Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of
Parent, by any other party, in each case except as would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on Parent. All contracts, agreements, arrangements or
understandings of any kind between any affiliate of Parent (other than any
wholly owned Parent Subsidiary), on the one hand, and Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, on the other hand, are on terms no less favorable to Parent or to
such Parent Subsidiary than would be obtained with an unaffiliated third party
on an arms-length basis.

(p) _Insurance_. _Section 3.2(p)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter contains a
list of all material insurance policies that are owned by Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries or which names Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries
as an insured (or loss payee), including those which pertain to Parents or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries assets, employees or operations. All such
insurance policies are in full force and effect, are in such amounts and
cover such losses and risks as are consistent with industry practice and, in
the reasonable  



 

39  judgment of senior management of Parent, are adequate to protect the
properties and businesses of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries and all
premiums due thereunder have been paid. Neither Parent nor any of the Parent
Subsidiaries is in material breach or default under, or has received notice of
cancellation of any such insurance policies.

(q) _Interested Party Transactions_. No event has occurred since December 31,
2007 that would be required to be reported by Parent pursuant to Item 404(a)
of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act.

(r) _Voting Requirement_. The affirmative vote at the Parent Stockholders
Meeting of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders
of outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock,
voting together as a class, is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of Parents capital stock necessary to approve this Agreement and the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (the _"Parent Stockholder
Approval"_ ).

(s) _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. Parent has received the opinion of J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc., dated as of the date of this Agreement, to the effect
that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration is fair from a financial point
of view to Parent, a signed copy of which opinion has been delivered to the
Company.

(t) _Brokers_. Except for J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., no broker, investment
banker, financial advisor or other person is entitled to any brokers,
finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent. Parent has furnished to the
Company true and complete copies of all agreements under which any such
fees, commissions or expenses are payable and all indemnification and other
agreements related to the engagement, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, of persons to whom such fees, commissions or
expenses are payable. 

(u) _Availability of Funds_. Parent has fully committed debt financing in an
amount sufficient to pay the Cash Consideration and all fees, expenses and
other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent or its Affiliates by this
Agreement, and Parent has provided the Company true, correct and accurate
copies of the commitment letters in respect of such debt financing. At
the Closing, Parent will have available cash in an amount sufficient for
Parent and Merger Sub to timely pay the Cash Consideration and all fees,
expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent or its Affiliates
by this Agreement.

(e) _Advice of Changes_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly advise the other parties to this Agreement orally and in writing to
the extent it has knowledge of any change or event having, or which, insofar
as can reasonably be foreseen would  



 

45  reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on such party or
the ability of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ to be
satisfied before the end of six months from the date hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such notification will affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement and no failure to comply with this _Section 4.1(e)_ shall be taken
into account for purposes of determining whether the conditions to Closing
have been satisfied.

Section 4.2 _No Solicitation by the Company_.

(a) _Company Takeover Proposal_. The Company shall and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and its and their officers, directors, employees, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants and other advisors, investment bankers,
representatives and agents retained by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, other than in the case of officers, directors and employees, in
their capacity as such, (collectively, the _"Company Representatives"_ ) to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated immediately all existing
activities, discussions and negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company
Takeover Proposal. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall not, shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, and shall direct the
Company Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate
or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public
information), or knowingly facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into any Acquisition Agreement or enter
into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) initiate or participate in any way
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or knowingly furnish or disclose
to any person (other than a party hereto) any non-public information with
respect to, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate or knowingly
further any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
and which Company Takeover Proposal was made after the date hereof and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this _Section 4.2_, the Company may, if
and only to the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to
do so could be reasonably likely to be a violation of its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Delaware Law, and subject to
compliance with _Section 4.2(c)_, (i) furnish non-public information with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such
Company Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such person than the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that all such
information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such
person, and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person
making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such
Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing,  



 

46  the parties agree that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 4.2(a)_ by any Company Representative (other than in the case of
officers, directors and employees, acting in their capacity as such) shall be
deemed to be a breach of this _Section 4.2(a)_ by the Company.

(b) _Definitions_. As used herein, (i) _"Superior Proposal"_ means a bona
fide written Company Takeover Proposal (except that the references in the
definition thereof to "25%" shall be replaced by "75%") that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after
consulting with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation), taking into account all legal, financial and
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal (including any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation), the
likelihood and timing of required governmental approvals and consummation and
the ability of the person making the proposal to finance and pay the
contemplated consideration, would be more favorable to the stockholders of the
Company than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any
adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by Parent in response to such
Company Takeover Proposal) and (ii) _"Company Takeover Proposal"_ means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent or its
affiliates) relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of
a business that constitutes 25% or more of the net revenues, net income or the
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B)
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 25% or more of any class of
equity securities of the Company, (C) any tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 25% or more of
any class of equity securities of the Company, or (D) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, asset purchase, recapitalization or
similar transaction involving the Company, other than the transactions
contemplated or permitted by this Agreement.

(c) _Actions by the Company_. Neither the Board of Directors of the Company
nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or approve, any Company Takeover Proposal (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as a _"Company Adverse
Recommendation Change"_ ) or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.2(a)) (an _"Acquisition
Agreement"_ ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be a
violation of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Delaware Law, the Company may (A) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(iii)_ and cause the Company to enter into an
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (which was made
after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
_Section 4.2_) or (B) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, if: (i)
the Company provides written notice (a _"Notice of Adverse Recommendation"_
) advising Parent that  



 

47  the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor, including, if applicable, the terms and
conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action
by the Board of Directors (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to the amount of consideration or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation); (ii) for a
period of three Business Days following Parents receipt of a Notice of
Adverse Recommendation the Company negotiates with Parent in good faith to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable the Company to proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement and
the Merger and not make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change (it being
understood that such negotiation need not be exclusive); and (iii) if
applicable, at the end of such three Business Day period, the Board of
Directors of the Company continues to believe that the Company Takeover
Proposal, if any, constitutes a Superior Proposal (after taking into account
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement). No Company
Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the Board of
Directors of the Company for purposes of causing any state takeover Law
(including Section 203 of the DGCL) or other state Law to be inapplicable to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) _Notice of Company Takeover Proposal_. From and after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall promptly (but in any event within one calendar
day) notify Parent in the event that the Company receives, directly or
indirectly, (i) any Company Takeover Proposal; (ii) any request for non-
public information relating to any of the Company Entities by any person that
informs the Company or any Company Representative that such person is
considering making, or has made, a Company Takeover Proposal, or (iii) any
request for discussions or negotiations relating to a possible Company
Takeover Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing,
and shall indicate the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity
of the other party or parties involved and promptly furnish to Parent and
Merger Sub a copy of any such written inquiry, request or proposal. The
Company agrees that it shall keep Parent reasonably informed, in all material
respects, of the status and details (including amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such request, Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and keep
Parent reasonably informed, in all material respects, as to the details of any
information requested of or provided by the Company and as to the details of
discussions or negotiations with respect to any such request, Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry, including by providing a copy of all material
documentation of the Company Takeover Proposal.

(e) _Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Other Applicable Law_. Nothing contained in
this _Section 4.2_ shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing
to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors (after consultation with outside counsel), failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to violate its or the Companys
obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board
of Directors of the Company may not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, unless permitted to do so by _Section 4.2(c)_, _provided_ , _further_
, that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any "stop, look
and listen" disclosure in and of itself shall not be considered a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change.



 

48 (f) _Return or Destruction of Confidential Information_. The Company agrees
that immediately following the execution of this Agreement it shall request
each person which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with such persons consideration of acquiring the Company to return
or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such person
by or on the Companys behalf.

ARTICLE V

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 5.1 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholders Meetings_.

(a) _Form S-4 Proxy Statement_. As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Joint Proxy Statement and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form
S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus.
Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to have the
Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders,
and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to Parents stockholders, in each case as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act.
Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file a general
consent to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable
state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock
in the Merger and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock as Parent may reasonably
request in connection with any such action. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or
amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by the
Company or Parent, in each case, without providing the other party and its
respective counsel the reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon
and giving due consideration to such comments. The parties shall notify
each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff
and any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the
Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or for additional information and shall
supply each other with copies of all correspondence between such party or any
of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff on the other
hand, with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger.
Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop
order or the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the
Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
 



 

49  supplement describing such information must be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of each
of the Company and Parent.

(b) _Stockholders Meetings_.

(i) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the _"Company Stockholders Meeting"_ ) in accordance with
applicable Law, the Company Charter and by-laws for the purpose of obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to _Section 4.2(c)_, the Company
shall (A) through the Board of Directors of the Company, recommend to its
stockholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and include in the Joint Proxy
Statement such recommendation and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit and obtain such approval and adoption. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, subject to its rights under _Section 4.2(c)_, the Company
agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section
5.1(b)(i)_ shall not be affected by any Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
the Company or its stockholders of any Company Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall provide Parent with the Companys stockholder list as and when requested
by Parent, including at any time and from time to time following a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change. 

(ii) Parent shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the _"Parent Stockholders Meeting"_ ) in accordance with
applicable Law, Parents Amended Articles of Incorporation and Regulations for
the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval. Parent shall (A)
through the Board of Directors of Parent, recommend to its stockholders the
approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and
include in the Joint Proxy Statement such recommendation, (B) use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain such approval and (C) not
withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, the
recommendation contemplated by clause (A) or recommend, adopt or approve
or publicly propose to recommend, adopt or approve any Parent Alternative
Proposal (any such action in this clause (C) being referred to as a _"Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change"_ ; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to obtaining the Parent
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good
faith that failure do so would reasonably be reasonably likely to be a
violation of its fiduciary duties to the Stockholders of Parent under the
Ohio General Corporation Law, Parent may make a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change. Parent agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of
this _Section 5.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be affected by any Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change. Parent shall provide the Company with Parents
stockholder list as and when requested by the Company, including at any time
and from time to time following a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change. Parent may not make any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change unless:
(i) Parent provides the Company three Business Days advance written notice
advising the Company that the Board of Directors of Parent intends to take
such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including, if applicable,
the material terms of any Parent Alternative Proposal  



 

50  that is the basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors of Parent
and during such three Business Day period, Parent negotiates with the Company
in good faith in order to enable Parent to proceed with its recommendation of
this Agreement and the Merger and not make such Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change.

(iii) Each of Parent and the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
to hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting and the Company Stockholders Meeting
at the same time on the same day.

Section 5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject to the agreement,
dated June 21, 2007, between the Company and Parent (the  _"Confidentiality
Agreement"_ ), the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to,
afford to the Parent Representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to all of the Company Entities properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records and all other information concerning their
business, properties and personnel as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably
request. Parent and Merger Sub shall hold, and shall cause their respective
affiliates and the Parent Representatives to hold, any nonpublic information
in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be
obligated to provide any such access or information to the extent that doing
so (x) may cause a waiver of an attorney-client privilege or loss of attorney
work product protection, (y) would violate a confidentiality obligation to any
person or (z) would be materially disruptive to the business or operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, _provided_ , that the Company and Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access or
information in a manner that avoids or removes the impediments described in
clauses (x), (y) and (z).

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent
Subsidiaries to, afford to the Company Representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours, to all of the Parent Entities properties,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and all other
information concerning their business, properties and personnel as the Company
may reasonably request. The Company shall hold, and shall cause their
respective affiliates and the Parent Representatives to hold, any nonpublic
information in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary shall
be obligated to provide any such access or information to the extent that
doing so (x) may cause a waiver of an attorney-client privilege or loss of
attorney work product protection, (y) would violate a confidentiality
obligation to any person or (z) would be materially disruptive to
the business or operations of Parent, _provided_ , that Parent and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access or
information in a manner that avoids or removes the impediments described in
clauses (x), (y) and (z).

Section 5.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation_.

(a) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, including _Section 5.3(d)_, each of the parties
agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist  



 

51  and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to obtain satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the
Merger, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, clearances, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and
the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) preventing
the entry, enactment or promulgation of any injunction or order or Law that
could materially and adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto to
consummate the transactions under this Agreement, (iv) seeking the lifting or
rescission of any injunction or order or Law that could materially and
adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the
transactions under this Agreement, (v) cooperating to defend against any
proceeding or investigation relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and to cooperate to defend against it and respond
thereto, (vi) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry
out the purposes of, this Agreement, (vii) using commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange for the Companys independent accountants to provide such
comfort letters, consents and other services that are reasonably required in
connection with Parents financings of the Cash Consideration and (viii)
assisting in the marketing and sale or any other syndication of any such
financings by making appropriate officers of the Company available for due
diligence meetings and for participation in the road show and meetings with
prospective participants in such financings upon reasonable notice and at
reasonable times, _provided_ , that in the case of clauses (vii) and (viii),
Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for all out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by, and otherwise indemnify and hold harmless, the Company, its
Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, accountants and
representatives from and against all liabilities, relating to such actions
other than those arising from such persons willful misconduct or
gross negligence. For purposes of this Agreement, reasonable best efforts
shall not require the parties to (i) sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose
of or conduct the business of the Company, Parent and/or any of their
respective affiliates in a manner which would resolve such objections or
suits, (ii) agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct
the business of the Company, Parent and/or any of their respective affiliates
in a manner which would resolve such objections or suits, (iii) permit the
sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any of the assets of the
Company, Parent and/or any of their respective affiliates or the execution of
any agreement or order to do so, and (iv) conduct the business of the
Company, Parent and/or any of their respective affiliates in a manner which
would resolve such objections or suits, except to the extent any such action
described in clauses (i) through (iv) would not reasonably be expected to
materially impair the benefits each of Parent and the Company reasonably
expects to be derived from the combination of Parent and the Company through
the Merger. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
Parent and the Company agrees to make an appropriate filing under HSR with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and
in any event within 20 Business Days following the date hereof and to supply
as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other
actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable.



 

52 (b) _No Takeover Statutes Apply_. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that no Takeover Statute or similar Law is or becomes
applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) if any Takeover Statute or similar Law becomes
applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) _Opinions Regarding Tax Treatment_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate
with each other in obtaining the opinions of Jones Day, counsel to Parent,
for the benefit of Parent, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, counsel
to the Company, for the benefit of the Companys stockholders, respectively,
dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that the Merger will constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In connection
therewith, each of Parent and the Company shall deliver to Jones Day and
Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP customary representation letters in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel, and at such time or
times that may be reasonably requested by such counsel (the representation
letters referred to in this sentence are collectively referred to as the
_"Tax Certificates"_ ). None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall take
or cause to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue (or fail to
take or cause not to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any
of such certificates and representations.

(d) _Information Cooperation_. In connection with the efforts referenced in 
_Section 5.3(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, and to obtain
all such approvals and authorizations under any other applicable Antitrust
Law, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other
party informed in all material respects of any material communication (and if
in writing, provide a copy of such communication) received by such party from,
or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity and of
any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) permit the other party to review any material
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, any such Governmental Entity or in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, (iv) consult and cooperate with the
other party and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions or proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of the
Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates to any such Governmental
Entity or private party and (v) not participate in any substantive meeting or
have any substantive communication with any Governmental Entity unless it has
given the other parties a reasonable opportunity to consult with it in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other the
opportunity to attend and participate therein. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement and any attorney-client, work product or other privilege, each of
the parties hereto will coordinate and cooperate fully with the other parties
hereto in exchanging such information and  



 

53  providing such assistance as such other parties may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act. Any competitively sensitive
information that is disclosed pursuant to this _Section 5.3(d)_ will be
limited to each of Parents and the Companys respective counsel pursuant to a
separate customary confidentiality agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Antitrust Law" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all
other Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.3_, if any objections are asserted with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any suit
is instituted or threatened to be instituted by any Governmental Entity or any
private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Law or which would otherwise prevent, impede or delay the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as reasonably practicable. Neither the Company nor Parent shall, and they
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to, acquire or agree to acquire
any assets, business, securities, person or subdivision thereof, if the
entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of
such acquisition, could reasonably be expected to materially delay
or materially increase the risk of not obtaining the applicable action,
nonaction, waiver, clearance, consent or approval under the Antitrust Laws or
any other competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Laws.

(f) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that their obligations
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are
not conditioned or contingent upon receipt of any financing.

(g) The parties shall, and shall cause their respective advisors, to
use their reasonable best efforts jointly (i) to compile, by no later than
the seventh calendar day after the date hereof, a definitive list of all
consents, approvals and filings under any applicable Laws governing antitrust
or merger control matters in jurisdictions outside the United States that, if
not obtained or made, would prohibit the consummation of the Merger and (ii)
to expand, as promptly as practicable, such list after such seventh calendar
day to the extent that, subsequent to such seventh day, there are any changes
in applicable Law or the application or interpretation thereof (including the
adoption of new applicable Laws) that result in the existence of new consents,
approvals and filings under any applicable Laws governing antitrust or merger
control matters in jurisdictions outside the United States that, if not
obtained or made, would prohibit the consummation of the Merger .

Section 5.4 _Stock Options; Restricted Stock and Performance Shares_.

(a) _Assumption of Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, (i) each
outstanding Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested immediately
prior to the Effective Time, to purchase shares of Company Common Stock, and
(ii) each of the Company Stock Plans and all agreements thereunder, shall be
assumed by Parent. To the extent provided  



 

54  under the terms of the Company Stock Plans, all such outstanding options
shall accelerate and become immediately exercisable in connection with the
Merger in accordance with their existing terms. Except for the acceleration
of the Company Stock Options in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock
Plans and any agreements thereunder, prior to or at the Effective Time, each
Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement (an _"Adjusted
Option"_ ) shall continue to have, and be subject to, substantially the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under the Company Stock Plans and the
documents governing the Company Stock Options immediately before the
Effective Time, except that (x) each Company Stock Option will be exercisable
for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise
of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the sum
of (1) the Stock Consideration plus (2) the Cash Consideration divided by the
Closing Price and (y) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option will be equal
to the quotient determined by dividing the per share exercise price of the
Company Stock Option by the sum of (1) the Stock Consideration plus (2) the
Cash Consideration divided by the Closing Price. The date of grant of each
Adjusted Option will be the date on which the corresponding Company Stock
Option was granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the adjustment described
in this Section 5.4(a) shall be made in a manner consistent with Section 409A
of the Code and, with respect to each Company Stock Option that is an
incentive stock option (within the meaning of Section 422(b) of the Code), no
adjustment will be made that would be a modification (within the meaning of
Section 424(h) of the Code) to such option.

(b)  _Stock Plans_. The Company and Parent agree that each of the Company
Stock Plans and all relevant Parent Stock Plans will be amended, to the extent
necessary, to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including conversion of shares of the Company Common Stock held or to be
awarded or paid pursuant to such benefit plans, programs or arrangements into
shares of Parent Common Stock on a basis consistent with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent agree to submit the
amendments to the Parent Stock Plans or the Company Stock Plans to their
respective stockholders if such submission is determined to be necessary by
counsel to the Company or Parent after consultation with one another; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that such approval will not be a condition to the
consummation of the Merger.

(c) _Reservation of Shares_. Parent will (i) reserve for issuance the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock that will become subject to the benefit
plans, programs and arrangements referred to in this _Section 5.4_ and (ii)
issue or cause to be issued the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, pursuant to applicable plans, programs and arrangements, upon the
exercise or maturation of rights existing thereunder on the Effective Time or
thereafter granted or awarded. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent will prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock necessary to fulfill Parents obligations under this _Section
5.4_. Such registration statement will be kept effective (and the current
status of the prospectus required thereby will be maintained) for at least as
long as Adjusted Options remain outstanding.



 

55 (d) _Notices_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will
deliver to the holders of the Company Stock Options appropriate notices
setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the
agreements evidencing the grants of such Company Stock Options and that such
Company Stock Options and the related agreements will be assumed by Parent
and will continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustment required by this _Section 5.4_ after giving effect to the Merger).

(e) _Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding unvested
share of restricted Company Common Stock issued under a Company Stock
Plan (each, a _"Restricted Share"_ ) shall become vested and no longer
subject to restrictions, and as a result shall be treated in the Merger as set
forth in _Section 2.1_.

(f) _Performance Shares_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding performance
share granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a  _"Performance Share"_ )
shall vest according to the terms of the applicable Performance Share
agreement, and the holder of each Performance Share agreement shall be
entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the sum of
(A) the Cash Consideration plus (B) the product of the Stock Consideration
multiplied by the Closing Price, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that would be issuable under such Performance Share
agreement.

(g) _Withholding_. All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ shall
be paid net of any required withholding of federal, state, local or foreign
taxes, unless withholding is effected otherwise with the consent of the
recipient, and shall be paid without interest.

Section 5.5 _Indemnification_.

(a) _Rights Assumed by Surviving Corporation_. Parent agrees that all rights
to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including any matters arising
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) now
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation, by-laws (or comparable organizational
documents) or in any agreement between the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any current or former director, officer or employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, will be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation without further action, as of the Effective Time, and
will survive the Merger and will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

(b) _Successors and Assigns of Surviving Corporation_. In the event that the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.5_.

(c) _Continuing Coverage_. From the Effective Time and for a period of six
years thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in
effect directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons
who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability  



 

56  insurance policy (a copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Parent)
(the _"Indemnified Parties"_ ) on terms with respect to such coverage and
amount no less favorable than those of such current insurance coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300%
of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that, if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent will be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount; and
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that at Parents option in lieu of the
foregoing insurance coverage, the Surviving Corporation or Parent may purchase
six-year "tail" insurance coverage in favor of the Indemnified Parties that
provides coverage identical in all material respects to the coverage described
above. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if two Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, Parent has not completed the actions
contemplated by the last proviso of the preceding sentence, the Company may,
with prior notice to Parent, purchase six-year "tail" insurance coverage in
favor of the Indemnified Parties that provides coverage identical in all
material respects to the coverage described above, provided that the Company
does not pay in excess of $1,500,000.

(d) _Intended Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this _Section 5.5_ are (i)
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and in
the case of _Section 5.5(a)_, current and former directors, officers and
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and (ii) in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

Section 5.6 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before holding any press conferences, analysts calls or other
meetings or discussions and before issuing any press release or other public
announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger. The parties will provide each other the opportunity to
review and comment upon any press release or other public announcement or
statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or other
public announcement or statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange. The parties agree
that the initial press release or releases to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be mutually agreed upon
prior to the issuance thereof.

Section 5.7 _NYSE Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Parent Common Stock issuable either to the Companys stockholders
as contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant to _Section 5.4_, to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any
event prior to the Closing Date.

Section 5.8 _Stockholder Litigation_. The parties to this Agreement shall
cooperate and consult with one another, to the fullest extent possible, in
connection with any stockholder litigation against any of them or any of their
respective directors or officers with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In furtherance of and without in any way limiting the
foregoing, each of the parties shall use its respective reasonable best
efforts to prevail in such litigation so as to permit the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by  



 

57  this Agreement in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as
reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company agrees that
it will not compromise or settle any litigation commenced against it or its
directors or officers relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) without Parents prior written
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Section 5.9 _Tax Treatment_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code and to
obtain the opinions of counsel referred to in _Sections 6.2(d)_ and _6.3(d)_
, including forbearing from taking any action that would cause the Merger not
to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

Section 5.10 _Standstill Agreements; Confidentiality Agreements_. During the
period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, neither
Parent nor the Company shall terminate, amend, modify or waive any
provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries, or the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable, is a party, other than (a) the Confidentiality
Agreement, pursuant to its terms or by written agreement of the parties
thereto, (b) confidentiality agreements under which Parent or the Company, as
applicable, does not provide any confidential information to third parties,
(c) standstill agreements that do not relate to the equity securities of
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, or the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or (d) to the extent necessary to take any actions that the
Company or any third party would otherwise be permitted to take pursuant to
_Section 4.2_ (and in such case only in accordance with the terms of _Section
4.2_). During such period, except to the extent any such agreement is
terminated, amended, modified or any provision thereof waived in accordance
with the preceding sentence, Parent and the Company shall enforce, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such
agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such
agreements and by enforcing specifically the terms and provisions thereof in
any court of competent jurisdiction.

Section 5.11  _Section 16(b)_. Parent and the Company shall take all steps
reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) or acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including derivative
securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act.

Section 5.12 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) _Company Obligations_. The Company shall adopt such amendments to the
Company Benefit Plans as requested by Parent and as may be necessary to ensure
that Company Benefit Plans cover only employees and former employees (and
their dependents and beneficiaries) of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. With respect to any Company Common Stock held by any Company
Benefit Plan as of the date of this Agreement or thereafter, the Company
shall take all actions necessary or appropriate (including such actions as are
reasonably requested by Parent) to ensure that all participant voting
procedures contained in the Company Benefit Plans relating to such shares,
and all applicable provisions of ERISA, are complied with in full.



 

58 (b) _Parent Obligations_. For the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the second anniversary thereof, the Parent shall cause to be
maintained on behalf of employees of the Company at the Effective Time other
than individuals covered by a collective bargaining agreement (the _"Company
Employees"_ ), considered as a group, compensation opportunities and employee
benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the
compensation opportunities and employee benefits provided by the Company or
its Subsidiaries, as applicable. 

(c) _Credit for Service of Company Employees_. If Company Employees are
included in any benefit plan maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (a
_"Parent Plan"_ ) following the Effective Time, such Company Employees shall
receive credit for service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
their predecessors prior to the Effective Time to the same extent such
service was counted under similar Company Benefit Plans for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, level of benefits and benefit accrual under such Parent
Plan, or if there is no such similar Company Benefit Plan, to the same extent
such service was recognized under the Alpha Natural Resources, LLC and
Subsidiaries Retiree Medical Benefit Plan ( _"Retiree Plan"_ ), including,
without limitation, the Legacy Company service and Acquired Company service,
as defined in the Retiree Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time,
provided that (i) such recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate
any benefits payable to the Company Employee with respect to the same period
of service, (ii) service of Company Employees subject to collective
bargaining agreements or obligations shall be determined under such collective
bargaining agreements or obligations, (iii) in no event will such recognition
of service for purposes of benefit levels or benefit accrual under a defined
benefit pension plan of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary apply for any purpose
other than determining the annual rate of benefit accrual under a cash balance
pension plan formula for a period after the date that any such Company
Employee first actually becomes eligible to participate therein, and (iv) in
no event will such recognition of service be taken into account for purposes
of determining a Company Employees eligibility to participate in a retiree
medical benefit plan maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. If Company
Employees or their dependents are included in any medical, dental or health
plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates (a _"Successor Plan"_ ) other than
the plan or plans in which they participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a _"Prior Plan"_ ), any such Successor Plan shall not include
any restrictions or limitations with respect to pre-existing condition
exclusions or any actively-at-work requirements (except to the extent such
exclusions were applicable under any similar Prior Plan at the Effective Time)
and any eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of such Prior Plan
ending on the date such Company Employees participation in such Successor
Plan begins shall be taken into account under such Successor Plan for purposes
of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such Successor Plan;  _provided_ _however_ , that the rights
under a Successor Plan of any Company Employee subject to collective
bargaining agreements or obligations shall be determined pursuant to such
collective bargaining agreements or obligations. 

(d) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this _Section 5.12_ shall (i)
confer any rights upon any person, including any Company Employee or former
employees of the Company, other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, (ii) 



 

59  constitute or create an employment agreement, or (iii) constitute or be
treated as the amendment, modification or adoption of any employee benefit
plan of Parent, the Company of any of their Affiliates.

Section 5.13 _Actions with Respect to Existing Debt_. (a) Provided
that Parent complies with its obligations under this _Section 5.13_, the
Company will, upon receiving any written request by Parent to do so, use its
reasonable best efforts to commence as soon as reasonably practicable in light
of Section 5.13(c) a tender offer (the _"Notes Tender Offer"_ ) for all
outstanding 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 of the Company (the
_"Notes"_ ). As part of any Notes Tender Offer, the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit the consent of the holders of the Notes
(the _"Notes Consents"_ ) to amend, eliminate or waive certain sections (as
may be proposed by Parent) of the Indenture, dated as of April 7, 2008,
between the Company, as issuer, and Union Bank of California, National
Association, as trustee (the _"Indenture"_ ). The aggregate consideration
payable to each holder of Notes pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer will be an
amount in cash established and funded by Parent. The Notes Tender Offer will
be made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement
prepared by Parent in connection with the Notes Tender Offer in a form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company; _provided_ , _that_ any
such Notes Tender Offer will be subject to the conditions set forth in
_Section 5.13(b)_ (as amended from time to time, the _"Notes Offer
to Purchase"_ ).

(b) The Companys and the Surviving Corporations obligation to accept for
payment and pay for the Notes tendered pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer
will be subject to the conditions that (i) the Merger will have occurred (or
Parent and the Company will be satisfied that it will occur substantially
concurrently with such acceptance and payment) and (ii) such other conditions
as may be proposed by Parent, including such other conditions as are customary
for transactions similar to the Notes Tender Offer. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Notes Tender Offer, substantially concurrently with the
Closing, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to accept for
payment and thereafter to promptly pay for all Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Notes
shall be required to be purchased nor shall any payments be required to be
made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Notes
Tender Offer prior to the Effective Time. The Company will waive any of
the conditions to the Notes Tender Offer as may be requested by Parent (other
than the conditions that the Notes Tender Offer is conditioned on the Merger
as provided in clause (i) above and that there shall be no Law, injunction or
other legal restraint prohibiting consummation of the Notes Tender Offer), so
long as such waivers would not cause the Notes Tender Offer to violate the
Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the _"TIA"_ ), or
any other applicable Law, and will not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, waive any condition to the Notes Tender Offer or make any change,
amendment or modification to the terms and conditions of the Notes Tender
Offer (including any extension thereof) other than as agreed between Parent
and the Company or as required to comply with applicable Law.

(c) After having submitted a request to the Company pursuant to _Section
5.13(a)_, Parent will prepare, as promptly as practicable, the Notes Offer to
Purchase, together with any required related letters of transmittal and
similar ancillary agreements and other necessary and appropriate documents
(such documents, together with all supplements and



 

60  amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the _"Notes
Tender Offer Documents"_ ), relating to the Notes Tender Offer and will use
its reasonable best efforts to cause to be disseminated to the record holders
of the Notes and, to the extent known to the Company, the beneficial owners of
the Notes (collectively, the _"Noteholders"_ ) the Notes Tender Offer
Documents; _provided_ , _however_ , that, upon reasonable request, Parent will
provide the Company with any information for inclusion in the Notes Tender
Offer Documents that may be required under applicable Law and all mailings to
the Noteholders in connection with the Notes Tender Offer shall be subject to
the prior review of, and comment by, the Company and shall be reasonably
acceptable to it before dissemination. The Company shall reasonably cooperate
with Parent in the preparation of the Notes Tender Offer Documents. If at any
time prior to the acceptance of the Notes pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer
any event should occur or any information should be discovered by the Company
or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Notes Tender Offer Documents, so that the Notes Tender Offer Documents shall
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading or so that the Notes Tender Offer Documents comply with applicable
Law, the party that becomes aware of such event or discovers such information
shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to promptly notify the other
party, and Parent shall prepare and disseminate to the Noteholders on behalf
of the Company such amendment or supplement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that prior to such dissemination, Parent will provide copies thereof to the
Company not less than two Business Days (or such shorter period of time as is
reasonably practicable in light of the circumstances) in advance of any such
dissemination, will regularly consult with the Company with respect to and
during the process of preparing such amendment or supplement and will include
in such amendment and supplement all reasonable comments proposed by the
Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.13(c)_,
the Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, the TIA and any other applicable Law in connection with the
Notes Tender Offer and such compliance will not be deemed a breach hereof.

(d) Promptly following the expiration of the consent solicitation, assuming
the requisite consents from Noteholders (including from persons holding
proxies from the Noteholders) have been received, the Company will use
reasonable best efforts to cause an appropriate supplemental indenture (the
_"Supplemental Indenture"_ ) to become effective providing for the amendments
of the Indenture contemplated in the Notes Tender Offer Documents; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Supplemental Indenture shall become effective only
concurrently with the Effective Time and only if all conditions to the Notes
Tender Offer have been satisfied or waived by the Company in accordance with
the terms hereof and thereof and the Surviving Corporation accepts all Notes
(and related Notes Consents) validly tendered for purchase and payment
pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer, whereupon the proposed amendments set
forth in the Supplemental Indenture shall become operative. The form and
substance of the Supplemental Indenture will be reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and the Company.

(e) In connection with the Notes Tender Offer, Parent may select one or more
dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and other agents, in each
case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to provide assistance
in connection therewith and the Company shall enter into customary agreements
(including indemnities) with such parties so selected. Parent shall pay, on
behalf of the Company, the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any  



 

61  dealer manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in
connection with the Notes Tender Offer upon the incurrence of such fees
and out-of-pocket expenses, and Parent further agrees to reimburse the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their directors, officers, employees,
consultants, financial advisors, accountants, legal counsel, investment
bankers, and other agents, advisors and representatives, for all of their
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Notes Tender
Offer promptly following the incurrence thereof. The Company agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to cause its counsel to provide any legal opinions
reasonably requested dealer manager engaged in connection with the Notes
Tender Offer. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and each of
their respective officers, directors and each person that controls the Company
within the meaning of Section 20 of the Exchange Act (each a _"Company
Person"_ ) from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by any Company Person, or to which any Company Person may become
subject, that arises out of, or in any way in connection with, the Notes
Tender Offer or any actions taken, or not taken by Company, or at the
direction of Company, pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ or at the request of
Parent (provided, that Parent shall not indemnify the Company pursuant to this
_Section 5.13_ with respect to any liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties to the extent
arising from information supplied in writing by the Company specifically for
inclusion in the Notes Tender Offer Documents).

Section 5.14 _Parent Board of Directors_. As of the Effective Time, the board
of directors of Parent shall take all actions as may be required to appoint
to vacancies or newly-created seats on such board of directors, to serve until
such persons respective successor shall have been duly elected and qualified
or until the earlier of such persons death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the amended articles of incorporation and regulations of
Parent and applicable Law, the following persons: Michael J. Quillen and Glenn
A. Eisenberg. At least one of the directors designated pursuant to this 
_Section 5.14_ shall meet the independence standards of the listing standards
of the NYSE. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the Effective Time,
any such designee shall decline or be unable to serve, Parent and the Company
shall agree on mutually acceptable replacement designees. As of the Effective
Time, Parent shall take all actions as may be required to appoint Kevin S.
Crutchfield as chief executive officer and president of the coal division of
Parent until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or
until his earlier death, resignation or removal. As of the Effective Time,
Parent shall take all actions as may be required to appoint Michael J. Quillen
as non-executive vice-chairman of Parents board of directors until his
successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his earlier
death, resignation or removal.

Section 5.15 _Dissenters  Rights_. Parent shall give the Company prompt
notice of any demands received by Parent for the fair cash value of Parent
Common Stock. Parent (i) shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, waive any requirement under or compliance with the laws of the State
of Ohio applicable to any stockholder of Parent demanding the fair cash value
of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") and
(ii) shall require each Dissenting Shareholder holding shares of Parent Common
Stock in certificated form to deliver such shares to Parent, and Parent shall
endorse on shares a legend to the effect that a demand for the fair cash
value of such shares has been made.



 

62 Section 5.16 _Company Credit Facility_. The Company shall, prior to the
Closing Date, deliver to Parent a payoff letter in customary form, providing
that upon receipt from the Surviving Corporation of the repayment amount
stated therein on the Closing Date, all of the Companys outstanding
obligations (other than contingent obligations for indemnification that are
not then due and payable) under that certain Credit Agreement, dated October
26, 2005, by and among Alpha NR Holding, Inc., Alpha Natural Resources, LLC,
Citicorp North America, Inc., UBS Securities LLC, Bank of America, N.A.,
National City Bank of Pennsylvania and PNC Bank, N.A., Citigroup Global

the Company by Parent promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days
after the date of such termination. In the event of a termination of

event later than two Business Days after the date of such termination.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the conditions to

(z) In the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(i)_, _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ or  _Section 7.1(d)(i)_, and (A) prior to

designed to cause the termination or failure of the Merger or this Agreement
shall have been made public and (B) within 12 months of such termination
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to, or consummates, any Parent Alternative Proposal, then Parent
shall pay, or cause to be paid, upon the earlier to occur of the execution of
such definitive agreement and such consummation, the Parent Termination Fee,
payable by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated in writing
to Parent by the Company. A " _Parent Alternative Proposal_ " means any

(c) _Failure to Pay Fees and Expenses_. Each party acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, neither party would enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if

7.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit
that results in a judgment against such party for the Company Termination Fee,
Parent Termination Fee, Company No Vote Fee or Parent No Vote Fee, as
applicable, that results in a judgment against  



 

68  the defaulting party for the Company Termination Fee, Parent Termination
Fee, Company No Vote Fee or Parent No Vote Fee, as applicable, the defaulting
party shall pay to the other party its reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee,
Parent Termination Fee, Company No Vote Fee or Parent No Vote Fee, as
applicable. Without limiting any rights or remedies of the parties in law or
equity, in no event shall the aggregate fees payable by either party pursuant
to _Section 7.3(b)_ exceed the Parent Termination Fee or the Company
Termination Fee, as applicable. The payment of any fees payable by either
party pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ shall not constitute or be construed as
constituting liquidating damages or prejudice any rights or remedies
available to the parties in law or equity.

other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)
subject to the proviso of _Section 8.10_, waive compliance by the other
parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement.
Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver will be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on  



 

73  behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

Section 8.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement will
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.
