Section 2.5 _Further Conveyances and Assumptions; Consent of Third Parties_.

 



 

(a) From time to time following the Closing, Sellers shall, or shall cause
their Affiliates to, make available to Purchaser such non-confidential data in
personnel records of Transferred Employees as is reasonably necessary for
Purchaser to transition such employees into Purchasers records.

 



 

(b) From time to time following the Closing, Sellers and Purchaser shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver
all such further conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases and acquaintances
and such other instruments, and shall take such further actions, as may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate to assure fully to Purchaser and its
respective successors or assigns, all of the properties, rights, titles,
interests, estates, remedies, powers and privileges intended to be conveyed to
Purchaser under

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement and the Seller Documents and to assure fully to Sellers and
their Affiliates and their successors and assigns, the assumption of the
liabilities and obligations intended to be assumed by Purchaser under this
Agreement and the Seller Documents, and to otherwise make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to assign
any Purchased Asset, including any Contract, Permit, certificate, approval,
authorization or other right, which by its terms or by Law is nonassignable
without the consent of a third party or a Governmental Body or is cancelable
by a third party in the event of an assignment (" _Nonassignable Assets_ ")
unless and until such consent shall have been obtained. With respect to
Material Contracts or Permits that are material for the Business as a going
concern after the Closing Date, Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Purchaser for up to one hundred and eighty (180) days following the Closing
Date in endeavoring to obtain such consents promptly; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such efforts shall not require Sellers or any of their Affiliates to
incur any expenses or Liabilities or provide any financial accommodation or to
remain secondarily or contingently liable for any Assumed Liability to obtain
any such consent. Purchaser and Sellers shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, any
consent, substitution, approval or amendment required to novate all
Liabilities under any and all Purchased Contracts or other Liabilities that
constitute Assumed Liabilities or to obtain in writing the unconditional
release of Sellers and their Affiliates so that, in any such case, Purchaser
shall be solely responsible for such Liabilities. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, as of and from the Closing Date and during the cooperation
period until such time as consents are obtained, or in the event consents to
the assignment thereof cannot be obtained, such Nonassignable Assets shall be
held, as of and from the Closing Date, by Sellers or the applicable Affiliate
of Sellers in trust for Purchaser and the covenants and obligations thereunder
shall be performed by Purchaser in Sellers or such Affiliates name and all
benefits and obligations existing thereunder shall be for Purchasers account.
Sellers shall take or cause to be taken at Purchasers expense such actions in
their name or otherwise as Purchaser may reasonably request so as to provide
Purchaser with the benefits of the Nonassignable Assets and to effect
collection of money or other consideration that becomes due and payable under
the Nonassignable Assets, and Sellers or the applicable Affiliate of Sellers
shall promptly pay over to Purchaser all money or other consideration received
by them in respect of all Nonassignable Assets. As of and from the Closing
Date, Sellers on behalf of Sellers and their Affiliates authorize Purchaser,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the Nonassignable
Assets, at Purchasers expense, to perform all the obligations and receive all
the benefits of Sellers or their Affiliates under the Nonassignable Assets and
appoint Purchaser their attorney-in-fact to act in their name on their behalf
or in the name of the applicable Affiliate of Sellers and on such Affiliates
behalf with respect thereto, and Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold
Sellers and their Affiliates, agents, successors and assigns harmless from and
against any and all Liabilities and Losses based upon, arising out of or
relating to Purchasers performance of, or failure to perform, such
obligations under the Nonassignable Assets.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Bulk Sales Laws_. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by Sellers
with the requirements and provisions of any "bulk-transfer" Laws of any
jurisdiction that may otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

be applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of the Purchased Assets
to Purchaser; it being understood that any Liabilities arising out of the
failure of Sellers to comply with the requirements of any "bulk-transfer" Laws
which would not otherwise constitute an Assumed Liability shall be treated as
an Excluded Liability.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Allocation of Consideration_. Within one hundred eighty (180)
days following the Closing, Purchaser shall provide Sellers with an allocation
of the Purchase Price (together with the Assumed Liabilities and other
relevant items) among the Purchased Assets (the " _Allocation_ ") which
Allocation will comply with the requirements of Code Section 1060 and
applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder, for Sellers review. Within
fifteen (15) days of Sellers receipt of such Allocation (the " _Review
Period_ "), Sellers may object to such Allocation by delivering notice to
Purchaser in writing. If at the expiration of the Review Period, Sellers have
not objected to the Allocation it will be deemed accepted as the final
Allocation. In the event that there is an objection timely raised by Sellers
to the Allocation during the Review Period, Sellers and Purchaser shall work
together in good faith to come to a mutually agreeable Allocation. If after
thirty (30) days, Sellers and Purchaser are unable to come to an agreement,
the Parties shall submit their dispute to the Accounting Referee (as defined
below) in accordance with _Section 3.3(c)_. In accordance with the final
Allocation, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Sellers copies of Form 8594
and any required exhibits thereto (the " _Asset Acquisition Statement_ ").
Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Sellers from time to time revised
copies of the Asset Acquisition Statement (the " _Revised Statements_ ") so as
to report any matters on the Asset Acquisition Statement that need updating
(including purchase price adjustments, if any), subject to the Sellers review
in accordance with this _Section 2.7_. All income Tax Returns and reports
filed by Purchaser and Sellers shall be prepared consistently with such
Allocation.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

 _CONSIDERATION_

 



 

Section 3.1 _Consideration_. The aggregate consideration for the Purchased
Assets shall be (a) an amount in cash equal to $240,000,000.00 (the "
_Purchase Price_ "), subject to adjustment as provided in _Sections 3.2(c)_
and _3.3_ (which, for purposes of clarification, is inclusive of any portion
of $4,566,666.59 (the " _Retention Bonus Escrow Amount_ ") and $7,833,333.41
(the " _Seller Retention Payments_ ") distributed or escrowed pursuant to the
Retention Bonus Agreement), and (b) the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities.
The Retention Bonus Escrow Amount shall be distributed by the applicable
escrow agent in accordance with the Retention Bonus Agreement. The Seller
Retention Payments shall be distributed by Sellers in accordance with the
Retention Bonus Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Payment of Purchase Price; Funding of Escrow Accounts_.

 



 

(a) On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay (i) the Purchase Price, less the
Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Retention Bonus Escrow Amount, to Sellers by
payment to an account designated by Sellers, (ii) the Indemnity Escrow Amount
to the Indemnity Escrow Agent by payment into the Indemnity Escrow Account,
and (iii) the Retention Bonus Escrow Amount to the applicable escrow agent by
payment into the Retention Bonus Escrow Account, each of which shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be held in an escrow account (the "
_Indemnity Escrow Account_ ") to be governed by the terms of this Agreement
and of an Indemnity Escrow Agreement, the purpose of which, as more fully set
forth _Sections 3.3(e)_ and _11.5(c)_ and in the Indemnity Escrow Agreement,
shall be to provide non-exclusive, readily accessible funds to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Losses upon the terms of and subject to
the limitations of _Article XI_.

 



 

(c) The Retention Bonus Escrow Amount shall be held in an escrow account (the
" _Retention Bonus Escrow Account_ ") to be governed by the terms of this
Agreement and by the Retention Bonus Agreement. The Retention Bonus Escrow
Amount shall be distributed as set forth in the Retention Bonus Agreement. To
the extent that the Retention Bonus Escrow Amount is distributed to employees
and not to Owner or Sellers, such amount shall be a reduction of the Purchase
Price and employee expense of Purchaser. For clarity, such reduction does not
require Purchaser to make up such reduction in Purchase Price paid to Sellers.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the
Sellers Representative, the Closing Statement (as defined below) in the form
of _Schedule 3.3(a)_ and a certificate based on such Closing Statement
setting forth Purchasers calculation of Closing Working Capital. The closing
statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") shall present the Net Working Capital
as of the end of business on the Closing Date (" _Closing Working Capital_ ").

 



 

(b) If the Sellers Representative disagrees with Purchasers calculation of
Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_, the Sellers
Representative may, within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Closing
Statement, deliver a notice to Purchaser stating its disagreement with such
calculation and setting forth the Sellers Representatives calculation of
such amount (" _Dispute Notice_ "). Any such notice of disagreement shall
specify those items or amounts as to which the Sellers Representative
disagrees, and Sellers shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and
amounts contained in the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing
Working Capital delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_.

 



 

(c) If Sellers Representative has delivered a Dispute Notice pursuant to
_Section 3.3(b)_, Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall, during the
thirty (30) days following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Working Capital. If
during such period, Purchaser and the Sellers Representative are unable to
resolve such items in dispute as provided in the Dispute Notice (the "
_Unresolved Items_ "), they shall promptly thereafter cause Montgomery Coscia
Greilich LLP (or if unable or unwilling to accept its mandate, an independent
accountant to be mutually agreed upon by the Sellers Representative and
Purchaser) (Montgomery Coscia Greilich LLP or such other independent
accountant, as the case may be, the " _Accounting Referee_ ") to review this
Agreement and the Unresolved Items for the purpose of calculating Closing
Working Capital, based solely on the provisions of this Agreement and the
written presentations by Purchaser

 



      
 

 



 

and the Sellers Representative and not on an independent review. The
Accounting Referee may not take oral testimony from the parties hereto or any
other Person. In making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall
consider only the Unresolved Items and its decision for each such Unresolved
Item shall not be greater than the greatest value, or lower than the lowest
value, for such item as provided by Sellers Representative in the Dispute
Notice or Purchaser in the Closing Statement, as the case may be. The parties
hereto agree that all adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality.
The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than
thirty (30) days from the date of engagement of the Accounting Referee), a
report setting forth such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding
upon Purchaser and Sellers. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee
shall be allocated between Sellers, on one hand, and Purchaser, on the other,
based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each such party bears to the total amount contested by such
parties.

 



 

(d) Purchaser and Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective
representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing
Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital and in the conduct of
the review referred to in this _Section 3.3_, including the making available
to the extent necessary of books, records, work papers and personnel.

 



 

(e) If Final Working Capital exceeds the Target Working Capital, Purchaser
shall pay to Sellers such difference, in the manner and with interest as
provided in _Section 3.3(f)_, the amount of such excess and, if the Target
Working Capital exceeds Final Working Capital, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser
such difference, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and
with interest as provided in _Section 3.3(f)_. " _Final Working Capital_ "
means Closing Working Capital (i) as shown in Purchasers calculation
delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_ if no Dispute Notice is duly delivered
pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_; or (ii) if such a notice of disagreement is
delivered, (A) as agreed by Purchaser and the Sellers Representative pursuant
to _Section 3.3(c)_ or (B) in the absence of such agreement, as shown in the
Accounting Referees calculation delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Final Working Capital be more
than the Sellers Representatives calculation of Closing Working Capital set
forth in the Dispute Notice or less than Purchasers calculation of Closing
Working Capital as set forth in the Closing Statement. In the event that an
amount is required to be paid by Sellers pursuant to this _Section 3.3(e)_,
Sellers Representative and Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Indemnity
Escrow Agent to pay such amount to Purchaser from the Indemnity Escrow
Account, and Sellers and Owner shall promptly replenish such distributed
amount in the Indemnity Escrow Account for satisfaction if indemnity claims
pursuant to _Section 11.5(c)_.

 



 

(f) Any payment pursuant to _Section 3.3(e)_ shall be made at a mutually
convenient time and place within five (5) Business Days after Final Working
Capital has been determined by wire transfer by Purchaser or the Sellers
Representative, as the case may be, of immediately available funds to the
account of such other party as may be designated in writing by such other
party. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this _Section 3.3_
shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the
date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest published
from time to time by the

 



      
 

 



 

 _Wall Street Journal_ as the "prime rate" at large U.S. money center banks
during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest
shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall
be calculated daily on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty five (365)
days and the actual number of days elapsed.

warranties of Sellers or Owner, including those set forth in _Article V_ and

Business. Purchaser further acknowledges that no Seller, any Affiliate
thereof, or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative thereof
or any other Person has been authorized to make nor has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Business, the Purchased Assets
or the Assumed Liabilities or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

any such information, including any confidential information memoranda, any
materials uploaded to any electronic data room in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any due diligence report by any
third party or any other document or information in any form provided or made
available to Purchaser or its Affiliates or any employee or representative
thereof, including management presentations, in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser specifically disclaims any
obligation or duty of Sellers or Owner to make any disclosures of fact not
required to be disclosed pursuant to the specific representations and

modified by the Disclosure Schedules). With respect to any projection or
forecast delivered by or on behalf of Sellers or Owner to Purchaser or its
Affiliates or any employee or representative thereof, Purchaser acknowledges
that (a) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
projections and other forecasts and plans, and that Purchaser is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it,
including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections and forecasts, (b) the accuracy and correctness of such
projections and forecasts may be affected by information which may become
available through discovery or otherwise after the date of such projections
and forecasts, (c) it is familiar with each of the foregoing and (d) neither

its obligations, and enforce its rights, under the Commitment Letter.
Purchaser shall give Sellers prompt notice of any material breach by any party
to the Commitment Letter of which Purchaser has become aware or any
termination of the Commitment Letter. Purchaser shall keep Sellers informed on
a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts
to obtain the proceeds of the Transaction Financing and shall not permit any
amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any material provision or
remedy under, the Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification, waiver or
remedy (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Transaction Financing, (ii)
adds new conditions or amends the existing conditions to the drawdown of the
Transaction Financing (except in connection with

 



      
 

 



 

any "market flex" terms contained in the Commitment Letter) or (iii) is
adverse to the interests of Sellers, in each case, in any material respect. In
the event that all or any portion of the Transaction Financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letter becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions set
forth in the Commitment Letter, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange alternative financing from the same or alternative sources
in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on terms that are no less favorable to Purchaser than the Commitment
Letter (the " _Alternative Financing_ ").

 



 

Section 8.12 _Warranty Claims_. After the Closing, all warranty claims related
to Products, whether sold before or after Closing, shall be received, analyzed
and reviewed by Purchaser, and Purchaser shall make a preliminary
determination on whether such warranty claim is a result of a defect in
manufacturing by a Seller, and respond to such warranty claims if it
reasonably determines that such warranty claim is not a result of a
manufacturers defect. If Purchaser makes a preliminary determination that the
cause of such Product warranty claim is a result of a defect in manufacturing
by a Seller, Purchaser shall be allowed to make a Claim for a Loss arising out
of such manufacturing defect pursuant to Article XI (such claim, a "
_Manufacturer s Defect Claim_").

advisors, of the Sellers to, provide to Purchaser such cooperation as is

facilitating the grant of a security interest in collateral and providing
related lender protections; _provided_ that (x) none of the Sellers shall be

the arrangement of the Transaction Financing, such cooperation or providing
any information utilized in connection therewith, except for such liability to

accounting advisors with respect to cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Transaction Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, including this _Section 8.13_, nothing

applicable, to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement, (B) unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the Sellers, (C) require
the Sellers to take any action that will conflict with or violate, or result

interference with the prompt and timely discharge of the duties of any of the
Sellers executive officers, or (E) result in any officer or director of the

such Transferred Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to

Plans shall credit such Transferred Employees for any

 



      
 

 



 

deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid in the year of initial
participation in the Purchaser Plans.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 9.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall be construed to prevent the termination of employment of any individual
Transferred Employee or any change in the employee benefits available to any
individual Transferred Employee, except as provided specifically herein.

Purchaser shall be responsible for all Liabilities with respect to Transferred

Schedules_ sets forth a schedule of each Transferred Employees accrued and
unused vacation, sick days and personal days as of the date hereof.

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 



 

Section 11.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties; Expiration of Pre-
Closing Covenants_. The representations and warranties of the parties
contained in _Articles V_, _VI_ and _VII_ of this Agreement shall survive the
Closing through and including, and shall expire and terminate on, the first
(1st) anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
representations and warranties of Sellers set forth in _Sections 5.1_
(Organization and Good Standing), _5.2_ (Authorization), _5.3(a)(i)_
(Conflicts; Consents of Third Parties), _5.6(a)_ (Title to Purchased Assets;
Sufficiency), _5.8_ (Taxes), _5.17_ (Environmental Matters) and _5.18_

warranties of Purchaser and Parent set forth in _Sections 7.1_ (Organization
and Good Standing), _7.2_ (Authorization of Agreement), _7.5_ (Financial

(90) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to the particular matter that is the subject matter thereof (in
each case before and after the first proviso of this sentence, the " _Survival
Period_ "); _further provided_ , that any obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless shall not terminate with respect to any Losses (hereinafter defined)
as to which the Person to be indemnified shall have given notice (stating in
reasonable detail the basis of the claim for indemnification) to the

 



      
 

 



 

indemnifying party in accordance with _Section 11.5(a)_ before the
termination of the applicable Survival Period. The covenants of Sellers and,
if applicable, Purchaser, set forth in _Sections 8.1_ , _8.2_ , _8.4_ and
_8.11_ shall expire and terminate upon the Closing (the " _Pre-Closing
Covenants_ "). Claims arising out of breaches of representations, warranties
and covenants, for which written notice was not provided in accordance with
terms of _Section 11.5_ prior to the expiration or termination of such
representation, warranty or covenant pursuant to this _Section 11.1_, shall
be irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived.

 



 

Section 11.2 _Indemnification by Sellers_. Subject to the remainder of this
_Article XI_, each Seller and Owner (each, a " _Seller Indemnifying Party_ ")
hereby agrees, from and after the Closing, to jointly and severally indemnify
and hold Purchaser and its respective officers, members, employees,
Affiliates, agents, attorneys, representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from and
against:

 



 

(a) any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, damages, costs and expenses,
(as limited by the limitations set forth in _Section 11.8_, individually, a "
_Loss_ " and, collectively, " _Losses_ ") based upon, attributable to or
resulting from the failure of any representation or warranty of any Seller
Indemnifying Party set forth in this Agreement or any other Seller Document or
Owner Document, to be true and correct in all respects at the date hereof and
at the Closing Date or other date as set forth therein;

 



 

(b) any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from the
breach of any covenant or other agreement on the part of any Seller
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement or any Seller Document or Owner
Document;

 



 

(c) any and all Losses based upon or attributable to the Excluded Assets and
the Excluded Liabilities; and

 



 

(d) any and all notices, actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands,
assessments, judgments, costs, penalties and expenses, including attorneys

incident to any and all Losses with respect to which indemnification is
provided hereunder.

(a) any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from the
failure of any representation or warranty of Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement or any other Purchaser Document, to be true and correct at the date
hereof and at the Closing Date;

 



 

(b) any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from the
breach of any covenant or other agreement on the part of Purchaser under this
Agreement or any other Purchaser Document;

 



 

(c) any and all Losses based upon or attributable to the Assumed Liabilities;

 



      
 

 



 

(d) any and all Expenses incident to any and all Losses with respect to which
indemnification is provided hereunder; and

 



 

(e) any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from an audit
performed by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts related to its
correspondence dated January 15, 2016.

 



 

Section 11.4 _Limitations_.

 



 

(a) None of the Seller Indemnifying Parties, collectively on the one hand, nor
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall have any Liability under _Sections
11.2(a)_ or _11.3(a)_ (and to the extent applicable thereto, _Sections
11.2(d)_ or _11.3(d)_ ), as the case may be, (i) for any event or condition
for which the Losses do not exceed $75,000.00 (the " _De Minimis Basket_ ")
and (ii) unless the aggregate amount of Losses for events or conditions that
exceed the De Minimis Basket incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or
the Seller Indemnified Parties for such Sections, respectively, exceeds
$2,400,000.00 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case the Seller Indemnifying
Parties, on the one hand, or Purchaser and Parent, on the other, as the case
may be, shall, subject to the other limitation set forth in this _Article
XI_, be required to pay the Losses arising out of events or conditions that
exceed the De Minimis Basket in excess of the Deductible; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the De Minimis Basket and the Deductible limitation described
in this _Section 11.4(a)_ shall not apply to Losses related to the failure of
any Fundamental Representations (excluding _Section 5.17_ (Environmental
Matters)) to be true and correct. No Seller Indemnifying Party shall have any
liability under _Sections 11.2(b), (c)_ and _(d)_ for Losses arising out of
Manufacturers Defect Claims unless the aggregate amount of such Losses
exceeds $50,000.00 (the " _Defect Basket_ "), in which case the Seller
Indemnifying Parties shall be required to pay for such Losses arising out of
Manufacturers Defect Claims in excess of the Defect Basket, provided that
such Losses actually do arise out of defects in manufacturing by a Seller.

 



 

(b) None of Sellers or Owner, collectively on the one hand, nor Purchaser or
Parent, on the other hand, shall have any Liability under _Sections 11.2(a)_
or _11.3(a)_ (and to the extent applicable thereto, _Sections 11.2(d)_ or
_11.3(d)_ ), as the case may be (i) in excess of $18,000,000.00, except for
Losses arising out of breaches of Fundamental Representations, or (ii) for
Losses in the aggregate in excess of the Purchase Price.

 



 

(c) No time limitation set forth in _Section 11.1_ or limitations based upon
an amount set forth in _Sections 11.4(a)_ or _11.4(b)_ shall apply with
regard to claims arising out of Fraud.

 



 

(d) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties right to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 11.2_ will be reduced by all insurance or other third party
indemnification proceeds actually received by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties. Purchaser and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
mitigate such Losses and (ii) claim and recover any Losses suffered by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties under all such insurance policies and other
third party indemnities. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall remit to
Sellers and Owner for the benefit of Sellers and Owner any such insurance or
other third party proceeds

 



       
 

 



 

that are paid to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to Losses for
which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have been previously compensated
pursuant to _Section 11.2_.

 



 

(e) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties right to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 11.2_ will be reduced for Losses to the extent that any Losses or
related Liability has been taken into account in the calculation of Closing
Working Capital.

 



 

(f) No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be compensated more than once for the
same Loss.

 



 

(g) None of the Retention Bonus Escrow Amount shall be used to satisfy any
Claims made under this _Section 11_.

 



 

Section 11.5 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or that any
claim or demand (" _Claim_ ") shall be asserted by any Person in respect of
which payment may be sought under _Sections 11.2_ or _11.3_ hereof (regardless
of the limitations set forth in _Section 11.4_), the indemnified party shall
reasonably and promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any Claim of
which it has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to
the indemnifying party (and in the case of a Claim made by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party prior to the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date, to the
Indemnity Escrow Agent; reference is made to Section 3(b) of the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement which provides for release of funds from the Indemnity Escrow
Account upon Sellers Representatives failure to object to such Claim within
twenty one (21) days following such notice), and such written notice shall
contain an estimate of the Claim amount. With respect to a Claim that arises
out of a Legal Proceeding brought by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_
"), the indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to
the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified
against hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates
to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, it shall within thirty (30) days
(or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) notify the
indemnified party of its intent to do so. If the indemnifying party elects not
to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party
Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, fails to
notify the indemnified party of its election as herein provided or contests
its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party for such Losses under this
Agreement, the indemnified party may defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim. If the indemnifying party shall
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party may
participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such indemnified party shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the
indemnifying party if (i) so requested by the indemnifying party to
participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified
party a conflict or potential conflict exists between the indemnified party
and the indemnifying party that would make such separate representation
advisable; and provided, further, that the indemnifying party shall not be
required to pay for more than one such counsel for all indemnified parties in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with any Third Party Claim. The parties hereto agree to cooperate
fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 11.5_ to the contrary, neither the indemnifying party nor the
indemnified party shall, without the written consent of the other party,
settle or compromise any indemnifiable Third Party Claim unless the claimant
provides to such other party an unqualified release from all liability in
respect of the indemnifiable Third Party Claim. After any final judgment or
award shall have been rendered by a Governmental Body of competent
jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a
settlement shall have been consummated, or the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with
respect to a Claim hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the
indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and the indemnifying
party shall be required, subject to _Section 11.5(c)_, to pay all of the sums
so due and owing to the indemnified party by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within ten (10) Business Days after the date of such notice.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 11.1_, the failure of the indemnified party to give
reasonably prompt notice of any Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise
affect the indemnifying partys obligations with respect thereto except to the
extent that the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice
as a result of such failure.

 



 

(c) Any payment that a Seller Indemnifying Party is obligated to make to a
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article XI_ shall be paid
first, to the extent there are sufficient funds in the Indemnity Escrow
Account, from the Indemnity Escrow Account. On the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (such date, the " _Indemnity Escrow
Termination Date_ "), the Indemnity Escrow Agent shall release the Indemnity
Escrow Amount plus all accrued interest thereon (to the extent not utilized to
pay any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any Claim) to the Sellers
Representative, except that the Escrow Agent shall retain an amount (up to the
total amount then held by the Indemnity Escrow Agent) equal to the amount of
all Claims for indemnification under this _Article XI_ asserted in accordance
with _Section 11.5(a)_ prior to the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date but not
yet resolved (" _Unresolved Claims_ "). The Indemnity Escrow Amount retained
for Unresolved Claims shall be released by the Indemnity Escrow Agent (to the
extent not utilized to pay the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any such
Claims resolved in favor of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties) upon their
resolution in accordance with this _Article XI_ and the terms of the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement. Each release of funds from the Indemnity Escrow
Account shall be made in accordance with _Section 3.3(e)_, this _Article XI_
and the terms of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement. For clarity, the Retention
Bonus Escrow Account is not available for the payment the working capital
adjustment pursuant to _Section 3.3(e)_ or for the payment of any Claims
under this _Article XI_. Each of Sellers Representative and Purchaser shall
jointly instruct the Indemnity Escrow Agent to release funds from the
Indemnity Escrow Account as provided in this _Section 11.5(c)_.

 



 

Section 11.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Purchaser and Sellers
agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article XI_ as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes. If, notwithstanding the
treatment required by the preceding sentence, any indemnification payment is
determined to be taxable to the party receiving such payment by

 



      
 

 



 

any Taxing Authority, the paying party shall also indemnify the party
receiving such payment for any Taxes incurred by reason of the receipt of such
payment and any Expenses incurred by the party receiving such payment in
connection with such Taxes (or any asserted deficiency, claim, demand, action,
suit, proceeding, judgment or assessment, including the defense or settlement
thereof, relating to such Taxes).

 



 

Section 11.7 _Exclusivity_. Except (a) in the case of Fraud and (b) in the
case where a party seeks to obtain injunctive relief or specific performance,
from and after the Closing, the rights of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
and the Seller Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article XI_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, with respect to any matter in any way arising from or relating to
this Agreement or its subject matter. Subject to the foregoing, to the maximum
extent permitted by Law, the parties hereto hereby waive all other rights and
remedies with respect to any matter in any way relating to this Agreement or
arising in connection herewith, whether under any Laws, at common law, in
equity or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 11.7_, together with the
provisions of this _Article XI_, were specifically bargained for by the
parties and were taken into account by such Persons in arriving at the
Purchase Price. Sellers and Owner have specifically relied upon the provisions
of this _Section 11.7_, together with the provisions of this _Article XI_,
in agreeing to the Purchase Price and in agreeing to provide the specific
representations and warranties set forth herein.

 



 

Section 11.8 _No Consequential Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement and with the exception of a partys
indemnification obligations arising from a Third Party Claim, no party shall,
in any event, be liable to any other Person for any consequential, incidental,
indirect, special or punitive damages of such other Person, including loss of
future revenue, income or profits, diminution of value, loss of business
reputation or opportunity or loss based upon multiples of income or revenue,
relating to the breach or alleged breach hereof (provided that such limitation
with respect to lost profits shall not limit Sellers right to recover
contract damages in connection with Purchasers failure to close in violation
of this Agreement).

 



 

Section 11.9 _Subrogation_. If the indemnifying party makes any payment on any
indemnifiable Claim, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent
of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the indemnified party against
any third party in respect of the Losses to which the payment related. The
parties hereto will execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary
to evidence and perfect the above described subrogation rights.

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 



 

Section 12.1 _Payment of Sales, Use or Similar Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall be responsible for (and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Sellers against) any sales taxes applicable to the Purchased Assets and for
all other applicable sales, use, stamp, documentary, filing, recording,
transfer or similar fees or taxes or governmental charges (including motor
vehicle registration, title recording or filing fees

 



      
 

 



 

and other amounts payable in respect of transfer filings) in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than taxes measured by
or with respect to income imposed on Sellers or their Affiliates). Sellers
shall file all necessary documents (including all Tax Returns) with respect to
all such amounts in a timely manner.

 



 

(b) All real property taxes, personal property taxes, or ad valorem
obligations and similar recurring Taxes and fees on the Purchased Assets for
taxable periods beginning before and ending after the Closing Date, shall be
prorated between Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand,
as of the Closing Date. Sellers shall be responsible for and shall pay all
such Taxes and fees on the Purchased Assets accruing solely during any period
up to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall pay all
such Taxes and fees on the Purchased Assets accruing solely during any period
on or after the Closing Date. With respect to Taxes described in this _Section
12.1(b)_, Sellers shall timely file all Tax Returns due before the Closing
Date with respect to such Taxes and Purchaser shall prepare and timely file
all Tax Returns due on or after the Closing Date with respect to such Taxes.
If one party remits to the appropriate taxing authority payment for Taxes,
which are subject to proration under this _Section 12.1(b)_ and such payment
includes the other partys share of such Taxes, such other party shall
promptly reimburse the remitting party for its share of such Taxes.

 



 

Section 12.2 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each
of Sellers and Owner, on the one hand, and Purchaser shall bear its own
expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument contemplated by
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. The expenses associated with retaining the Indemnity Escrow Agent
and the escrow agent used for the Retention Bonus Escrow Agreement shall be
shared equally between the Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the
other hand.

 



 

Section 12.3 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_. Each
party agrees that any suit, action or proceeding brought by such party against
the other in connection with or arising from this Agreement (" _Judicial
Action_ ") shall be brought against any of the parties only in any court in
Dallas County, Texas and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court (and of the appropriate appellate court)
in any such Judicial Action and waives any objection to venue laid therein.
Process in any such Judicial Action proceeding may be served on any party
anywhere in the world. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
party hereto agrees that service of process upon such party at the address
referred to in _Section 12.6_, together with written notice of such service
to such party, shall be deemed effective service of process upon such party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will
not (and will cause its Affiliates not to) bring or support any action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement, including

Commitment Letter, the Transaction Financing or the performance thereof, in
any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 12.4 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement
(including the exhibits hereto and the Disclosure Schedules) and the
Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire understanding and agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof
can be waived, only by written instrument making specific reference to this
Agreement signed by the party against whom enforcement of any such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this
Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such
action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing
waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No
failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, _Sections 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.8, 12.10_ and _12.14_ may not be

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas applicable to
contracts made and performed in such State. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, any action, claim, controversy or dispute of any kind or

construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

against Sellers as a result of or arising out of this Agreement or any other
transaction.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 12.13(a)_ above and _Section 12.13(e)_ below, the

or the fact that at any time Purchaser does not exist, (iv) the inaccuracy of
any of the representations and warranties of Purchaser under this Agreement,
(v) any neglect, delay, omission, failure or refusal of

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser to take or prosecute any action in connection with this Agreement,
(vi) the full or partial release of Purchaser on any liability or obligation,
except that Parent shall be released to the extent Sellers expressly release
Purchaser from liability with respect to all or a portion of any such
Obligations, or (vii) any other circumstance relating to the Obligations that
might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of or defense to
Parent not available to Purchaser who is liable for such Obligations.

 



 

(d) Parent waives notice of (i) acceptance of the guaranty contained in this
_Section 12.13_ (the " _Guaranty_ ") and (ii) the creation, renewal,
extension, modification, alteration or existence of any liability or
obligation of Purchaser constituting part of the Obligations.

 



 

(e) Sellers agree that in no event shall Parent be required to pay any amount
under the Guaranty except and then only to the extent that Purchaser is so
obligated to pay under the terms of the Obligations, and in each case,
notwithstanding any provision of this _Section 12.13_ to the contrary, the
Obligations are subject to, and Parent reserves the right to assert, any
defenses, counterclaims, and rights of set off and recoupment which Purchaser
may have to payment or performance of any Obligation, other than defenses that
Purchaser may possess relating to (i) lack of validity or enforceability of
this Agreement against Purchaser arising from Purchasers defective formation
or lack of qualification to do business in any applicable jurisdiction, (ii)
Purchasers lack of authority to enter into or perform this Agreement or the
due execution and delivery thereof, or (iii) the termination of existence,
dissolution, liquidation, insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, or other
reorganization of Purchaser.

 



 

(f) Each Seller hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and
shall cause its respective Affiliates not to institute, any proceeding or
bring any other claim arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby against Parent or any former, current or
future equity holder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, agent,
member, manager, general or limited partner, permitted assignee or Affiliate
of Parent (each a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ", and collectively the " _Non-
Recourse Parties_ "), whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of the Sellers against
Parent or any Non-Recourse Party by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Law, or otherwise,
except for (i) the Sellers rights to recover from Parent (but not any other
Person) under and to the extent provided in the Guaranty and subject to the
limitations described herein (" _Retained Guaranty Claims_ "), (ii) claims
that a Seller has against Purchaser under this Agreement (subject to the terms
and conditions hereof) (" _Retained Purchase Agreement Claims_ "), and (iii)
claims that a Seller has against any Non-Recourse Party under any agreement to
which such Non-Recourse Party is a party or otherwise bound (" _Retained Other
Claims_ "). Recourse against Parent with respect to the Retained Guaranty
Claims, subject to the limitations and conditions set forth herein, against
Purchaser with respect to the Retained Purchase Agreement Claims and against
any Non-Recourse Party with respect to the Retained Other Claims shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies of Sellers and all of its Affiliates against
Parent and any Non-Recourse Party in respect of any liabilities or obligations
arising under, or in connection with, the Guaranty or this Agreement or in
respect of any representations made or alleged to be made in connection the
Guaranty or the Agreement.
