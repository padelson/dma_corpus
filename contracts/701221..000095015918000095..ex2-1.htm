controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the

over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of

recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting prior to the
date hereof, management of Parent has disclosed to Parent auditors and the
audit committee of the Board of Directors of Parent (a) any significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over which could adversely affect Parent\'s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (b) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting.

pursuant to Article I and any other fees and expenses reasonably expected to
be incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. As of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, (i) no event has occurred which would constitute a breach or
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would

in each case, on the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other
party to the Commitment Letter, under the Commitment Letter, and (ii) Parent
does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the

Section 6.2 _Employee Benefits_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Holdco shall, and Holdco shall cause
the Emerson Surviving Corporation to, honor all Company Benefit Plans and
compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time, _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not prohibit Holdco from amending or
terminating any Company Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by the terms of
such Company Benefit Plan. For the period from the Closing Date through
December 31, 2019 (the " _Benefit Continuation Period_ "), Holdco agrees to
provide each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Effective
Time (each, a " _Continuing Company Employee_ "), while such Continuing
Company Employee remains employed by Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Effective Time, the Emerson Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries), with (i) a base salary or base wage rate and, if
applicable, annual cash incentive opportunity, at a level no lower than the
base salary or base wage rate and, if applicable, annual cash incentive
opportunity, in effect for the applicable Continuing Company Employee as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) Total Aggregate Benefits (as
defined below) on terms no less favorable than the Total Aggregate Benefits
provided to the applicable Continuing Company Employee as of immediately prior
to the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 6.2(a), " _Total Aggregate
Benefits_ " means employee welfare and retirement benefits (other than
severance benefits), collectively. Upon a termination by the Company, Holdco
or any Subsidiary of a Continuing Company Employee\'s employment under
severance qualifying circumstances during the Benefit Continuation Period,
such Continuing Company Employee shall be eligible to receive cash severance
pay in an amount equal to the cash severance pay for which such Continuing
Company Employee would have been eligible under the Company Benefit Plan which
is a severance plan (as identified on Section 6.2(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) applicable to such Continuing Company Employee as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, subject to the Continuing Company Employee\'s
execution without revocation of a release of claims in favor of Parent and its
Affiliates and satisfaction of any other eligibility requirements set forth in
such plan as in effect on the date hereof.

  

  

 

48  

  

  

(b) If the Effective Time occurs on or prior to December 31, 2018, the Company
may, but is not required to, pay immediately prior to the Closing to each
Continuing Company Employee (including the Company\'s executive officers) who
participates in the Company\'s Employee Annual Bonus Plan (the " _Company
Incentive Plan_ ") and who is then in good standing (as determined by the
Company in its discretion) a cash bonus in respect of such plan year in an
amount equal to two hundred percent (200)% of the Continuing Company
Employee\'s target bonus award under the Company Incentive Plan for 2018
(without pro-ration other than with respect to new hires and mid-year changes
to bonus targets). If the Effective Time occurs on or after January 1, 2019,
the Company may, but is not required to, pay immediately prior to the Closing
to each Continuing Company Employee who participates in the Company Incentive
Plan and who is then in good standing (as determined by the Company in its
discretion), a pro-rata cash bonus in respect of such plan year, in an amount
equal to (i) the cash bonus amount payable to such Continuing Company Employee
under the Company Incentive Plan based on the actual level of achievement of
the applicable performance criteria for such plan year measured through the
latest practicable date prior to the Closing Date, with such level of
achievement conclusively determined, in good faith, by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company in the ordinary course of
business (other than as to timing) and consistent with past practice prior to
the Closing, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days elapsed from January 1, 2019 through the day prior to the
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is 365. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a bonus or pro-rata bonus is to be paid by the Company under
this Section 6.2(b), any Continuing Company Employee who is party to an
executive employment agreement, covered by the Company\'s Change in Control
Severance Plan, or covered by or party to any other Company Benefit Plan that
provides for a full or prorated bonus upon termination of employment or a
change in control, shall not be entitled to receive a full or prorated bonus
under such agreement or plan in respect of the 2018 plan year or the
applicable portion of the 2019 plan year, and the Company shall effectuate the
foregoing through either an amendment to such agreement or plan, or receipt of
a waiver from the impacted Continuing Company Employee, as a condition to
payment of the bonus payout described in this Section 6.2(b), and Holdco will
be provided with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each such
amendment or waiver in advance and the Company shall consider Holdco\'s
comments in good faith. In addition, notwithstanding Section 6.2(a) hereof,
(i) if a bonus is paid by the Company to a Continuing Company Employee
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.2(b) with respect to the 2018
plan year, Holdco shall not be obligated to provide an annual cash incentive
opportunity or pay a bonus for 2018 to any such Continuing Company Employee,
and (ii) if a pro-rata bonus is paid by the Company to a Continuing Company
Employee pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 6.2(b) with respect
to the applicable portion of the 2019 plan year, Holdco shall not be obligated
to provide an annual cash incentive opportunity or pay a bonus to any such
Continuing Company Employee with respect to the portion of the 2019 plan year
ending prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

 

49  

  

  

(c) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan, Parent Benefit Plan or employee
benefit plan sponsored by Holdco, in each case, in which any Continuing
Company Employee first becomes eligible to participate on or after the
Effective Time (collectively, the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing Company
Employee shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, receive full credit
for the years of continuous service by such Continuing Company Employee
recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to a corresponding Company Benefit Plan to the same extent as if it
were service with Parent for all purposes other than (i) for purposes of
retiree medical plans or for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit
pension plans, (ii) where such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits, (iii) where such service was not recognized under the corresponding
Company Benefit Plan or no corresponding Company Benefit Plan existed or (iv)
for purposes of any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides
grandfathered benefits. With respect to any New Plan that is a welfare benefit
plan in which any Continuing Company Employees first become eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time, Holdco shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (A) cause to be waived any eligibility requirements or
pre-existing condition limitations except to the extent such eligibility
requirements or pre-existing conditions would apply under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan in which any such Continuing Company Employee was a
participant or eligible to participate as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (B) give effect, in determining any deductibles, co-
insurance or maximum out of pocket limitations, to amounts paid by such
Continuing Company Employees prior to the Effective Time under a Company
Benefit Plan in which any such Continuing Company Employee was a participant
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent that such
credit was given under such Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time)
in satisfying such requirements during the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs. If employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time become eligible to participate in New Plans (other
than existing Parent Benefit Plans) after the Effective Time, the provisions
of this Section 6.2(c) shall apply to such employees in the same manner as
such provisions apply to Continuing Company Employees.

  

(d) Prior to making any broad-based communication or written communications
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any schedules hereto),
the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication,
Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any
such mutually agreeable communication.

  

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in no event
later than thirty (30) days after the date hereof), the Company shall provide
Parent the following: (i) with respect to each material Company Benefit Plan,
to the extent applicable, (A) the most recent determination letter received by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from the IRS regarding the tax-
qualified status of such Company Benefit Plan; (B) the most recent financial
statements for such Company Benefit Plan; (C) the most recent actuarial
valuation report; (D) the current summary plan description and any summaries
of material modifications; and (E) Form 5500 Annual Returns/Reports, together
with all schedules thereto, for the most recent plan year; and (ii) complete
copies of the calculations prepared for purposes of Section 280G of the Code
for employees with a pay grade of M3 or higher and/or who are executive
officers and the related supporting data. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof (and in no event later than ninety (90) days after the
date hereof), the Company shall provide Parent with complete copies of the
calculations prepared for purposes of Section 280G of the Code for employees
with a pay grade below M3 who are reasonably expected to be "disqualified
individuals" for purposes of Section 280G of the Code.

  

  

 

50  

  

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 or any other provision of this
Agreement, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or
modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, including any
Company Benefit Plan or any Parent Benefit Plan, (ii) shall alter or limit the
ability of any of Holdco, the Whitman Surviving Corporation, the Emerson
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to amend,
modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any
time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, (iii) is
intended to confer upon any current or former employee any right to employment
or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment, or (iv) is intended
to confer upon any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current or
former employee, director, officer or other service provider or any
participant in a Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan,
agreement or other arrangement) any right as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement.

  

Section 6.3 _Indemnification Continuation_.

  

(a) For purposes of this Section 6.3, (i) " _Whitman Indemnified Person_ "
shall mean any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
Effective Time, (x) an officer or director of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or (y) serving at the request of Parent as an officer or director
of or in any similar capacity with another corporation, joint venture or other
enterprise or general partner of any partnership or a trustee of any trust,
(ii) " _Emerson Indemnified Person_ " shall mean any person who is now, or has
been at any time prior to the Effective Time, (x) an officer or director of or
in any similar capacity with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (y)
serving at the request of the Company as an officer or director of another
corporation, joint venture or other enterprise or general partner of any
partnership or a trustee of any trust and (iii) " _Proceeding_ " shall mean
any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, subpoena or investigation.

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Holdco shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify
each Whitman Indemnified Person and each Emerson Indemnified Person in
connection with any Proceeding based directly or indirectly (in whole or in
part) on, or arising directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) out of, the
fact that such Whitman Indemnified Person or Emerson Indemnified Person is or
was an officer or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case
of such Whitman Indemnified Person) or an officer or director of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of such Emerson Indemnified Person),
or is or was serving at the request of Parent (in the case of such Whitman
Indemnified Person) or the Company (in the case of such Emerson Indemnified
Person) as an officer or director of or in any similar capacity with another
corporation, joint venture or other enterprise or general partner of any
partnership or a trustee of any trust, whether

  

  

 

51  

  

pertaining to any matter arising before or after the Effective Time. In the
event of any such Proceeding, each Whitman Indemnified Person and each Emerson
Indemnified Person will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any such Proceeding from Holdco within a reasonable period of time
following receipt by Holdco from such Whitman Indemnified Person or Emerson
Indemnified Person of a request therefor; _provided_ that a Whitman
Indemnified Person or an Emerson Indemnified Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking (only to the extent required by the DGCL) to
repay Holdco for any expenses incurred by Holdco in connection with the
indemnification of such Whitman Indemnified Person or Emerson Indemnified
Person pursuant to this Section 6.3 if it is ultimately determined that such
Whitman Indemnified Person or Emerson Indemnified Person did not meet the
standard of conduct necessary for indemnification as set forth in the Parent
Organizational Documents (in the case of such Whitman Indemnified Person) or
the Company Organizational Documents (in the case of such Emerson Indemnified
Person). For six years from the Effective Time, the Whitman Surviving
Corporation and the Emerson Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
provisions of Parent\'s, the Company\'s or any of their respective
Subsidiaries\' certificates of incorporation or by-laws or similar
organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Whitman
Indemnified Person or Emerson Indemnified Person. In the event that Holdco,
the Whitman Surviving Corporation or the Emerson Surviving Corporation (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, Holdco, the Whitman Surviving
Corporation or the Emerson Surviving Corporation (as applicable) shall cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Holdco, the
Whitman Surviving Corporation or the Emerson Surviving Corporation (as
applicable) assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.3, unless such
assumption occurs by operation of Law.

  

(c) Holdco shall cause the Whitman Surviving Corporation and the Emerson
Surviving Corporation to, and the Whitman Surviving Corporation and the
Emerson Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect for six years from the
Effective Time, Parent\'s (in the case of the Whitman Surviving Corporation)
and the Company\'s (in the case of the Emerson Surviving Corporation) current
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies covering acts or
omissions occurring (or alleged to occur) prior to or at the Effective Time
with respect to Whitman Indemnified Persons or Emerson Indemnified Persons;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Whitman Surviving
Corporation or the Emerson Surviving Corporation be required to expend
pursuant to this Section 6.3(c) more than an amount per year equal to 450% of
current annual premiums paid by Parent (in the case of the Whitman Surviving
Corporation) or the Company (in the case of the Emerson Surviving Corporation)
for such insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Whitman Surviving Corporation or the Emerson Surviving
Corporation would be required to expend more than 450% of current annual
premiums, the Whitman Surviving Corporation or the Emerson Surviving
Corporation (as applicable) shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance
obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to 450% of current annual
premiums. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent may purchase at or prior to the
Effective Time, and the Company, in consultation with, and with the consent
of, Parent, may (and at the request of Parent, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to) purchase at or prior to the Effective Time, and/or
Holdco may purchase following the Effective Time, a six-year "tail" prepaid
officers\' and directors\' liability insurance policy in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Whitman
Indemnified Person or Emerson Indemnified Person (as applicable) for an amount
not to exceed 450% of current annual premiums. If such "tail" policy has been
established by Parent or the Company, Holdco shall not terminate such policy
and shall cause all obligations of Parent or the Company thereunder to be
honored by the Whitman Surviving Corporation and the Emerson Surviving
Corporation (as applicable).

  

  

 

52  

  

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.3 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger for a period of six years and are expressly intended to benefit each of
the Whitman Indemnified Persons and the Emerson Indemnified Persons;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any claim or claims for
indemnification are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights
to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
disposition of any and all such claims.

  

ARTICLE VII 
  
  ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

  

Section 7.1 _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Registration
Statement; Stockholder Meetings_.

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the Company and Parent shall cooperate in preparing the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the registration statement on Form S-4 (and any
amendment or supplement thereto) pursuant to which shares of Holdco Common
Stock issuable in the Merger will be registered with the SEC (the "
_Registration Statement_ ") (in which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will be included), and shall cause Holdco to file the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement with the SEC. Each of
Holdco, Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act as
soon after such filing as practicable, to ensure that the Registration
Statement complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and to keep the Registration Statement
effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. The Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall include the Company Recommendation, the Parent
Recommendation, and the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the
Company and of the Board of Directors of Parent in favor of approval of any
resolution required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act to approve, on an
advisory basis, the compensation required to be disclosed in the Registration
Statement pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, and the Parent
Recommendation, except to the extent there has been a Company Change in
Recommendation permitted by Section 7.4 (in the case of the Company
Recommendation) or there has been a Parent Change in Recommendation permitted
by Section 7.5 (in the case of the Parent Recommendation). Each of the Company
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its respective stockholders as promptly
as practicable after the Registration Statement becomes effective. The parties
shall promptly provide copies of any written comments received from the SEC
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration
Statement and promptly advise one another of any oral comments received from
the SEC. Prior to filing the Registration Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide
the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response in advance (including the proposed final version of such document or
response), except to the extent such disclosures relate to a Company
Acquisition Proposal or a Parent Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

 

53  

  

  

(b) Holdco, Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with
respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and applicable "blue sky" laws and the
rules and regulations thereunder. Each party will advise the other, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement
has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the
issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Holdco
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. No
amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement shall be filed without the approval of both parties
hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ that with respect to documents filed by a party which are
incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement, this right of approval shall apply only with respect
to information relating to the other party or such other party\'s business,
financial condition or results of operations. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that
such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company and Parent.

  

(c) The Company shall cause the Company Stockholders Meeting to be duly called
and held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the
Required Company Vote. In connection with such meeting, the Company (i)
subject to Section 7.4, shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Required Company Vote and otherwise comply with all legal requirements
applicable to such meeting and (ii) shall not submit any other proposal (other
than matters of procedure and matters required by Law to be voted on by the
Company\'s stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby and, if the Company
Stockholders Meeting is also the Company\'s annual stockholders meeting,
proposals customarily brought in connection with the Company\'s annual
stockholders meeting) to Company stockholders in connection with the Company
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company reasonably believes that (i) it
is necessary to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to ensure
that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting or
(ii) (A) the Company will not receive proxies representing a sufficient number
of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Required Company Vote, whether
or not a quorum is present, or (B) the Company will not have a sufficient
number of shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall have the right to, and shall upon
request by Parent, on one or more occasions postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the minimum duration necessary to remedy the
circumstances giving rise to such adjournment or postponement and not more
than an aggregate of 40 days (in the case of clause (ii) of this sentence) or
10 days (in the case of clause (i) of this sentence).

  

  

 

54  

  

  

(d) Parent shall cause the Parent Stockholders Meeting to be duly called and
held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the
Required Parent Vote. In connection with such meeting, Parent (i) subject to
Section 7.5, shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required
Parent Vote and otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to
such meeting and (ii) shall not submit any other proposal (other than matters
of procedure and matters required by Law to be voted on by Parent\'s
stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby and, if the Parent
Stockholders Meeting is also Parent\'s annual stockholders meeting, proposals
customarily brought in connection with Parent\'s annual stockholders meeting)
to Parent stockholders in connection with the Parent Stockholders Meeting
without the prior written consent of the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Parent reasonably believes that (i) it is necessary to postpone
or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to
the stockholders of Parent within a reasonable amount of time in advance of
the Parent Stockholders Meeting or (ii) (A) Parent will not receive proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to obtain
the Required Parent Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, or (B) Parent
will not have a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall have the right to,
and shall upon request by the Company, on one or more occasions postpone or
adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting for the minimum duration necessary to
remedy the circumstances giving rise to such adjournment or postponement and
not more than an aggregate of 40 days (in the case of clause (ii) of this
sentence) or 10 days (in the case of clause (i) of this sentence).

  

Section 7.2 _Access to Information_.

  

Upon reasonable notice, each of Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause
its respective Subsidiaries to) afford to the other party hereto and its
representatives (including Financing Parties and their Representatives)
reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all its officers, employees, properties, offices, plants
and other facilities and to all books and records, including financial
statements, other financial data and monthly financial statements within the
time such statements are customarily prepared, and, during such period, each
of Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries
to) furnish promptly to the other party hereto and its representatives
(including Financing Parties and their Representatives), consistent with its
legal obligations, all other information concerning its business, properties
and personnel as such Person may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that either party hereto may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that,
in such Person\'s

  

  

 

55  

  

  

reasonable judgment, (i) providing such access would result in the waiver of
any attorney-client privilege (provided that the withholding party shall use
reasonable best efforts to allow for such access to the maximum extent that
does not result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege), in the disclosure
of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality (provided that the withholding party shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consent of any such third party
to such access), or (ii) any Law of any Governmental Entity applicable to such
Person requires such Person or its Subsidiaries to preclude the other party
and its representatives from gaining access to any properties or information;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the withholding party will inform the requesting
party of the general nature of the document or information being withheld and
reasonably cooperate with the requesting party to provide such document or
information in a manner that would not result in violation of Law or the loss
or waiver of such privilege. No investigation by a party or its
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other party set forth in this Agreement.
Each party hereto will hold any such information that is non-public in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions
of that certain agreement, dated December 21, 2017 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), between the Company and Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
competitive sensitively information may be provided only to a limited subset
of the other party\'s personnel or representatives, as the case may be,
pursuant to customary "clean room" procedures.

  

Section 7.3 _Efforts_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the date hereof
and in any event no later than the Termination Date, including using
reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following as soon as practicable and
in any event no later than the Termination Date (i) preparing and filing, in
consultation with the other party and as promptly as practicable and advisable
after the date hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary applications,
notices, petitions, filings, and other documents and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all waiting period expirations or terminations, consents,
clearances, waivers, exemptions, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals,
permits, and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain all such waiting period
expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, exemptions,
licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (A) each party hereto
agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days
after the execution of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties, and to substantially comply as promptly as practicable with any
"second request" for additional information and documentary material under the
HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable, and (B) Parent agrees to file or cause to be filed within 45 days
following the execution of this Agreement "Form A" statements or equivalent
change of control applications (or, as reasonably determined by Parent, "Form
A" exemption requests or equivalent exemption requests) with the insurance
commissioners or regulators or departments of health or other Governmental
Entities in each jurisdiction where required by applicable Law; provided,
however, to the extent that subsequent to the filing of any such "Form A"
exemption request or equivalent exemption request it becomes reasonably
apparent that such exemption request is reasonably unlikely to be granted in a
timely manner, Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter,
withdraw such exemption request and file in substitution thereof a "Form A"
statement or equivalent change of control application with the applicable
Governmental Entity.

  

  

 

56  

  

  

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 7.3(a) to obtain all waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, exemptions, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law
(as defined below) or from any Governmental Entity, (i) cooperate in all
respects and consult with each other in connection with any communication,
filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, including by
allowing the other party and/or its counsel to have a reasonable opportunity
to review in advance and comment on drafts of any communications, filings and
submissions (and documents submitted therewith) and considering in good faith
any such comments; (ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission
(the " _FTC_ "), any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other person, including by promptly
providing copies to the other party of any such written communications, and of
any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) where legally permissible, permit
the other party to review any communication it gives to, and consult with each
other in advance of any substantive meeting, telephone call, or conference
with, the DOJ, the FTC, or such other Governmental Entity (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, with respect to all matters set forth in Section 7.3(a))
or other person ( _provided_ that materials may be redacted (A) to remove
references concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements in
effect prior to the date hereof, and (C) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege or confidentiality concerns), and allow the other party and/or its
counsel to attend and participate at any such meeting, telephone call or
conference (whether in person or by telephone). Parent and the Company may, as
each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material to be provided to the other under this Section 7.3(b) as "
_Antitrust Counsel Only Material_." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient
and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be)
or its legal counsel. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ "
means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, Laws relating to the Healthcare
Regulatory Approvals, and all other national, federal or state, domestic or
foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative
and judicial doctrines and other Laws that are designed or intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade, affecting competition or market
conditions through merger, acquisition or other transaction or effectuating
foreign investment.

  

  

 

57  

  

  

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including this
Section 7.3, Parent and the Company (if requested by Parent), along with their
respective Subsidiaries, shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or
cause to be taken any and all steps and to make or cause to be made any and
all undertakings necessary (x) to resolve such objections, if any, that a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction asserts under any Regulatory Law
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable Regulatory
Law asserted by any such Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case to
the extent necessary so as to enable the Closing to occur no later than the
Termination Date, which reasonable best efforts shall include (i) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, disposition, license or other
disposition of any Subsidiaries, operations, divisions, businesses, product
lines, contracts, customers or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), (ii) taking or committing
to take such other actions that may limit or impact Parent\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' (including the Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\') freedom
of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of Parent\'s or any
of its Subsidiaries\' (including the Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\')
operations, divisions, businesses, products lines, contracts, customers or
assets, (iii) entering into any orders, settlements, undertakings, contracts,
consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements to effectuate any of the
foregoing or in order to vacate, lift, reverse, overturn, settle or otherwise
resolve any order that prevents, prohibits, restricts or delays the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, in
any case, that may be issued by any court or other Governmental Entity, and
(iv) creating, terminating or divesting relationships, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, and (v)
forfeiting or non-continuing any Company License and Permit or Parent License
and Permit (including withdrawing or being compelled to withdraw from an
applicable jurisdiction or being subject to any suspension of a Company
License and Permit or Parent License and Permit), in each case in connection
with obtaining all, or eliminating any requirement to obtain any, waiting
period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, exemptions,
licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations for
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
Regulatory Law or from any Governmental Entity so as to enable to the Closing
to occur no later than the Termination Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Company shall not, unless requested to do so by Parent, commit to or effect
any action contemplated in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of the
immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, none of Parent, Holdco or the other Subsidiaries
of Parent shall be required to, and none of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall, without the prior written consent of Parent, take any action, or commit
to take any action, or agree to any condition or limitation contemplated in
this Section 7.3 that is not conditioned on the consummation of the Merger or
that would result in, or would be reasonably likely to result in, individually
or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company, Parent and
their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the
Merger, including the synergies expected to be realized from the Merger (a "
_Burdensome Condition_ ").

  

  

 

58  

  

  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 7.3, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction is instituted
challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) oppose fully and
vigorously, including by defending through litigation, any such action or
proceeding, (ii) pursue vigorously all available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal and (iii) seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any Order that is in effect that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that none of
Parent, Holdco or a Subsidiary of Parent shall be required to, and the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
take any action under this Section 7.3(d) that would result in, or would be
reasonably likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Burdensome
Condition. To assist Parent in complying with its obligations set forth in
this Section 7.3, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
provide to Parent such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

  

(e) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the expiration or termination of all waiting periods and all consents,
waivers, authorizations and approvals of all third parties, including
Governmental Entities (except those related to Regulatory Laws, which shall be
governed by the other subsections of this Section 7.3), necessary, proper or
advisable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to provide any notices to third parties required to be provided
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
will be required to, and without the prior written consent of Parent the
Company and its Subsidiaries will not, grant or offer to grant any
accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise), or make any payment, to
any third party in connection with seeking or obtaining its consent to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
obtaining the consents described in the first sentence of this Section 7.3(e)
is not a condition to the obligation of any party hereto to effect the Merger
except to the extent set forth in Section 8.1(d).

  

(f) The parties shall jointly develop, consult and cooperate with one another
regarding, the strategy for obtaining any necessary approval of, or responding
to any request from, inquiry by, or investigation by (including directing the
timing, nature and substance of all such responses), any Governmental Entity
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including determining the timing and content of any registrations, filings,
agreements, forms, notices, petitions, statements, submissions of information,
applications and other documents, communications and correspondence
contemplated by, made in accordance with, or subject to this Section 7.3;
provided, if the parties cannot agree on a jointly developed strategy,
notwithstanding their respective good faith attempts to do so, Parent shall
have the final say with respect to the strategy. Parent shall have the final
authority to direct and implement (or direct the implementation by the Company
of) the regulatory strategy; provided, however, that Parent will consult with
the Company and consider in good faith the views of the Company in advance of
making any decisions with respect to such strategy.

  

  

 

59  

  

  

Section 7.4 _No Solicitation by the Company_.

  

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.4, none of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall (whether directly or indirectly through
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives, advisors or other
intermediaries), nor shall the Company (directly or indirectly) authorize or
permit any of its or their controlled Affiliates, officers, directors,
representatives, advisors or other intermediaries or Subsidiaries to: (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the
submission of inquiries, proposals or offers from any Person (other than
Parent) relating to or that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
Company Acquisition Proposal, or agree to or endorse any Company Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) enter into any agreement (x) to consummate any Company
Acquisition Proposal or otherwise relating to any Company Acquisition
Proposal, (y) to approve or endorse any Company Acquisition Proposal or (z) to
require the Company, in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal, to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger; (iii) enter into or
participate in any discussions or negotiations in connection with any Company
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry with respect to any Company Acquisition
Proposal, or furnish to any Person any non-public information with respect to
its business, properties or assets in connection with any Company Acquisition
Proposal; or (iv) agree, propose or resolve to take, or take, any of the
actions prohibited by clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this sentence. The Company
shall immediately cease, and cause its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, representatives, advisors and other intermediaries to immediately

constitute a Company Superior Proposal and, following the end of such notice
period, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have considered in good
faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, and
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the
Company to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable Law and that the

Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were given effect.

come to an arrangement regarding, or offer or agree to compromise, settle or
come to an arrangement regarding, any Company Transaction Litigation without
the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , if any Company
Transaction Litigation continues after the Effective Time, the Company\'s pre-
Effective Time directors and officers may continue to retain the same counsel
engaged prior to the Effective Time with respect thereto.

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall provide the Company with prompt
notice of any stockholder litigation or claim against Parent and/or its
directors or officers relating to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (" _Parent Transaction Litigation_ ")
(including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto). Parent
shall control the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Parent Transaction
Litigation, and Parent shall consult with the Company with respect to the
defense, settlement and prosecution of any Parent Transaction Litigation and
shall consider in good faith the Company\'s advice with respect to such Parent
Transaction Litigation. Parent may not compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding, or offer or agree to compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding, any Parent Transaction Litigation without the prior
written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). If any litigation or claim meets the
definition of both Company Transaction Litigation and Parent Transaction
Litigation, it shall be treated as Parent Transaction Litigation, unless such
litigation or claim against Parent and/or its directors or officers is only
with respect to aiding and abetting or similar theories, in which case such
litigation or claim shall be treated as Company Transaction Litigation.

  

Section 7.7 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent, Holdco,
Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 agrees that no public release or announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party
without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or
announcement may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any
applicable United States securities exchange, in which case the party required
to make the release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final
form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so
required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party; _provided_
that the foregoing shall not apply to any public release or announcement so
long as the statements contained therein concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby are substantially similar to previous releases or
announcements made by the applicable party with respect to which such party
has complied with the provisions of this sentence.

and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) or Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Holdco
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Holdco Common
Stock) resulting from the Merger by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Parent or the Company or will become subject to such reporting requirements
with respect to Holdco, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  

Section 7.9 _Tax Matters_.

  

(a) The parties intend that (i) the Merger qualify as a transaction described
in Section 351 of the Code and (ii) the Whitman Merger qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of
Holdco, Parent and the Company will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to) use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not take
or knowingly fail to take any action (and will cause its Subsidiaries not to
take or knowingly fail to take any action) which action or failure to act
could reasonably be expected to impede or prevent the Merger from qualifying,
as a transaction described in Section 351 of the Code. Each of Holdco, Parent
and the Company will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to) use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Whitman Merger to qualify, and will not take or
knowingly fail to take any action (and will cause its Subsidiaries not to take
or knowingly fail to take any action) which action or failure to act could
reasonably be expected to impede or prevent the Whitman Merger from
qualifying, as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

  

(b) Each of Holdco, Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) use its reasonable best efforts and will cooperate with the
other to (i) execute and deliver customary tax representation letters that
include the representations referred to in Section 8.2(c) and Section 8.3(c)
as of the Closing Date (and, if requested, as of the date of effectiveness of
the Registration Statement) to each counsel referred to in Section 8.2(c) and
Section 8.3(c) in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel
and (ii) obtain the opinions referred to in Section 8.2(c) and Section 8.3(c),

eight independent members of the Board of Directors of Parent as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus the Chief Executive Officer of
Parent and (b) four independent members of the Board of Directors of the
Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. In furtherance of the
foregoing, within 30 days following the date hereof, the Company shall provide
to Parent a list of independent members of the Board of Directors of the
Company who are willing to serve as members of the Board of Directors of
Holdco effective at the Effective Time. Within 30 days following the date of
delivery of such list, Parent shall select the four members of the Board of
Directors of the Company from such list who shall serve as members of the
Board of Directors of Holdco effective at the Effective Time.

  

Section 7.11 _Financing_.

  

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary to consummate the Financing or any
Substitute Financing in an amount sufficient, together with cash on hand that
replaces or supplements the Financing consistent with the terms set forth in
this Section 7.11, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (including the payment of the Cash Consideration, any
other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article I and any other fees and
expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby) no later than the
Closing, including, to the extent necessary to consummate the Merger and such
other transactions, using reasonable best efforts to (i) (A) maintain in
effect the Commitment Letter and in all material respects comply with all of
their respective obligations thereunder and (B) negotiate, enter into and
deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Financing reflecting the
terms contained in the Commitment Letter (or with other terms agreed by Parent
and the Financing Parties, subject to the restrictions on amendments of the
Commitment Letter set forth below), so that such agreements are in effect no
later than the Closing, and (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all the
conditions to the Financing and the definitive agreements related thereto that
are in Parent\'s (or its Subsidiaries\') control. In the event that all
conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 have been satisfied or
waived or, upon funding of the Financing, shall have been satisfied or waived,
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Persons providing the Financing to fund on the Closing Date the
Financing, to the extent the proceeds thereof are required to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the payment
of the Cash Consideration, any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to
Article I and any other fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred
in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby). Parent and/or Holdco shall pay, or cause to be paid, as
the same shall become due and payable, all fees and other amounts under the
Commitment Letter.

  

(b) Parent will keep the Company reasonably informed on a timely basis of the
status of Parent\'s and its Subsidiaries\' efforts to obtain the Financing and
to satisfy the conditions thereof, including providing copies of any
amendment, modification or replacement of the Commitment Letter ( _provided_ ,
that any fee letter may be redacted to remove the fee amounts, the rates and
amounts included in the "market flex" and other economic terms that could not
adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination or aggregate
principal amount of the Financing) and shall give the Company prompt notice of
any fact, change, event or circumstance that is reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse impact on the Financing
necessary for the satisfaction of all of Parent\'s and its Subsidiaries\'

  

  

 

71  

  

  

obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Cash
Consideration, any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article I and
any other fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, including, promptly after obtaining Knowledge thereof, providing the
Company written notice of any (A) material breach or default by a Financing
Party or any party to any definitive document related to the Financing of the
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing, (B)
actual or threatened withdrawal, repudiation or termination in writing of the
Commitment Letter or the Financing by the Financing Parties or (C) material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Commitment Letter
or any definitive document related to the Financing with respect to the
obligations to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded
at Closing; _provided_ , that neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall
be under any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to
attorney client or similar privilege to the extent such privilege is asserted
in good faith or otherwise would violate or contravene any Law or any
obligation of confidentiality. Parent and Holdco may amend, modify, replace,
terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under the Commitment Letter without
the prior written approval of the Company, provided, that Parent and Holdco
shall not, without the Company\'s prior written consent, permit any such
amendment, replacement, modification, assignment, termination or waiver to be
made to, or consent to any waiver of, any provision of or remedy under the
Commitment Letter which would (i) reduce the aggregate cash amounts of the
Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount) unless the aggregate amount of the Financing following such
reduction, together with cash on hand and other financial resources of Parent
on the Closing Date, is sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including the payment of the Cash
Consideration, any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article I and
any other fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(it being understood that any such reduction in such amounts in accordance
with the terms of such Commitment Letter shall be permitted), (ii) impose new
or additional conditions to the Financing or otherwise expand, amend, modify
or waive any of the conditions to the Financing or (iii) otherwise expand,
amend, modify or waive any provision of the Commitment Letter, in a manner
that in any such case would reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or
make less likely the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date, (B) materially adversely
impact the ability of Parent or Holdco to enforce its rights against the
Financing Parties or any other parties to the Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto or (C) materially adversely affect
the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to timely consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Holdco may modify, supplement or
amend the Commitment Letter to (1) add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Commitment
Letter as of the date of this Agreement and (2) implement or exercise any
"market flex" provisions contained in the Commitment Letter. In the event that
new commitment letters and/or fee letters are entered into in accordance with
any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the Commitment
Letter permitted pursuant to this Section 7.11, such new commitment letters
and/or fee letters shall be deemed to be the "Commitment Letter" for all
purposes of this Agreement and references to "Financing" herein shall include
and mean the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as so amended,
replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, as applicable. Parent shall
promptly deliver to the Company copies of any termination, amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement of the Commitment Letter. If funds in the
amounts set forth in the Commitment Letter, or any portion thereof, become
unavailable (other than in accordance with the terms of the Commitment
Letter), Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event (x) notify the Company in
writing thereof and (y) use reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute
financing, including, as applicable, a commitment to provide such substitute
financing (on terms and conditions that are not materially less favorable to
Parent and/or Holdco, taken as a whole, than the terms and conditions as set
forth in the Commitment Letter, taking into account any "market flex"
provisions thereof) sufficient, together with cash on hand and other financial
resources of Parent on the Closing Date, to enable Parent and its Subsidiaries
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(including the payment of the Cash Consideration, any other amounts required
to be paid pursuant to Article I and any other fees and expenses reasonably
expected to be incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby) in accordance with the terms hereof
(the " _Substitute Financing_ ") and, promptly after execution thereof,
deliver to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the new commitment
letter and the related fee letters (in redacted form removing the fee amounts,
the rates and amounts included in the "market flex" and other economic terms
that could not adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability,
termination or aggregate principal amount of the Financing) or related
definitive financing documents with respect to such Substitute Financing. Upon
obtaining any commitment for any such Substitute Financing, such financing
shall be deemed to be a part of the "Financing" and any commitment letter for
such Substitute Financing shall be deemed to be the "Commitment Letter" for
all purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

 

72  

  

  

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to,

part of such financing;

  

(v) using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent or any of its Subsidiaries

such authorization letters contain customary disclaimers for the Company, its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives with respect to responsibility
for the use or misuse of the contents thereof).

  

  

 

75  

  

  

(d) All non-public information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries

permitted by Law and with appropriate contribution to the extent such
indemnification is not available, other than to the extent any such
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments or penalties are the result of the gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives, or such Person\'s material breach of this Agreement, or with
respect to any material misstatement or omission in information provided in
writing hereunder by any of the foregoing Persons for use in connection

expenses actually incurred by each such Person in connection with the
cooperation provided under this Section 7.11 and Section 7.12, such financing
or Existing Debt Modification, whether or not the Merger is consummated or
this Agreement is terminated. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company\'s breach of any of the covenants required to be
performed by it under this Section 7.11 or Section 7.12 will not be considered
in determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 8.2(b)
unless such breach is the primary cause of Parent being unable to obtain the
proceeds of the Financing at the Closing.

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all
notices and take all other actions, to the extent requested in writing by

Program Termination_ "). In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts
to deliver to Parent executed termination letters with respect to the Company
Commercial Paper Program in form and substance customary for transactions of
its type, acknowledged or otherwise executed by the applicable placement
agents or dealers.

  

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all
notices and take all other actions required to facilitate the termination of
commitments in respect of the Company Credit Agreement and, to the extent
requested in writing by Parent, any other Indebtedness incurred by any of the

the Company shall promptly and in any event no later than ten (10) days prior
to the Closing Date notify Parent of the amount of any such Indebtedness
incurred or to be incurred and expected to be outstanding on the Closing
Date), the repayment in full of all obligations in respect of such
Indebtedness and the release of any Liens securing such Indebtedness and
guarantees in connection therewith on the Closing Date (such terminations,
repayments and releases, the " _Existing Credit Facility Terminations_ "). In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent (A) at
least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date draft payoff letters and (B)
on the Closing Date, executed payoff letters, in each case, with respect to
the Company Credit Agreement and, to the extent requested by Parent, any
Indebtedness incurred by any of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the
date hereof (each, a " _Payoff Letter_ ") in form and substance customary for
transactions of this type, from the applicable agent on behalf of the Persons
to whom such Indebtedness is owed, which Payoff Letters together with any
related release documentation shall, among other things, include the payoff
amount and provide that Liens (and guarantees), if any, granted in connection
therewith relating to the assets, rights and properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries securing such Indebtedness and any other obligations secured
thereby, shall, upon the payment of the amount set forth in the applicable
Payoff Letter at or prior to the Closing, be released and terminated.

the outstanding Company Notes for securities issued by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Offers to Exchange_ "); and (ii) solicit the consent of
the holders of Company Notes regarding certain proposed amendments to the
applicable indenture (each, an " _Indenture_ ") governing such Company Notes
(the " _Consent Solicitations_ " and, together with the Offers to Purchase and
Offers to Exchange, if any, the " _Company Note Offers and Consent
Solicitations_ ", and together with the Existing Program Termination and the
Existing Credit Facility Terminations, the " _Existing Debt Modifications_ ");
_provided_ that the closing of any such transaction shall not be consummated
until the Closing and any such transaction shall be funded using consideration
provided by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company or one
of its Subsidiaries). Any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations shall
be made on such terms and conditions (including price to be paid and
conditionality) as are proposed by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries and which
are permitted by the terms of such Company Notes, the applicable Indenture and
applicable Laws, including SEC rules and regulations. Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall consult with the Company regarding the material terms and
conditions of any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations, including the
timing and commencement of any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations
and any tender deadlines. Parent shall not be permitted to commence any
Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations until Parent shall have provided
to the Company the necessary offer to purchase, offer to exchange, consent
solicitation statement, letter of transmittal, press release, if any, in
connection therewith, and each other document relevant to the transaction that
will be distributed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to holders of the
Company Notes in the applicable Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations
(collectively, the " _Debt Offer Documents_ ") a reasonable period of time in
advance of commencing the applicable Company Note Offers and Consent
Solicitations to allow the Company and its counsel to review and comment on
such Debt Offer Documents (and the Parent shall consider in good faith
comments of the Company and its counsel thereon). Subject to the receipt of
the requisite consents, in connection with any or all of the Consent
Solicitations, the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture to the
applicable Indenture in accordance with the terms thereof amending the terms
and provisions of such Indenture as described in the applicable Debt Offer
Documents in a form as reasonably requested by Parent, which supplemental
indenture shall not become effective until Closing. Subject to Section
7.11(e), at Parent\'s or its Subsidiaries\' expense, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their respective Representatives to, on a timely basis, upon the
reasonable request of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, provide cooperation
in connection with any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations
(including but not limited to requesting, and using reasonable best efforts to
cause, the Company\'s independent accountants to provide customary consents
for use of their reports to the extent required in connection with any Company
Note Offers and Consent Solicitations); _provided_ that prior to the Closing,
neither the Company nor counsel for the Company shall be required to furnish
any certificates, legal opinions or negative assurance letters in connection

supplemental indentures and legal opinions (such legal opinions solely with
respect to redemptions), respectively, to the trustee under the applicable

opinions are required thereby, would not conflict with applicable Laws and

(j) For purposes of this Section 9.2(c) and Section 9.2(e), the term "
_Company Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term
in Section 7.4(a), except that all references to "more than 20%" in the
definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference
to "more than 50%", and the term " _Parent Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have
the meaning assigned to such term in Section 7.5(a), except that all
references to "more than 20%" in the definition of "Parent Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "more than 50%".

  

(k) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
are not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, Parent, Holdco and the
Merger Subs would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to
timely pay any amounts due pursuant to this Section 9.2, the Company will also
pay to Parent Parent\'s reasonable costs and expenses (including legal fees
and expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any
lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment of such overdue
amount, together with interest on the unpaid amount under this Section 9.2,
accruing from its due date, at an interest rate per annum equal to two
percentage points in excess of the prime rate quoted by The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to pay or cause
to be paid the Company Termination Fee more than once. Each of the parties
hereto acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee is not intended to be a
penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision.

  

(l) Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are
not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter
into this Agreement. If Parent fails to pay promptly the amounts due pursuant
to this Section 9.2, Parent will also pay to the Company the Company\'s
reasonable costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in
connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other legal
action, taken to collect payment of such overdue amount, together with
interest on the unpaid amount under this Section 9.2, accruing from its due
date, at an interest rate per annum equal to two percentage points in excess
of the prime rate quoted by The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in no event
shall Parent be required to pay or cause to be paid the Parent Termination Fee
more than once and (ii) in no event shall Parent be required to pay or cause
to be paid both the Parent Termination Fee and the Reverse Termination Fee.
Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Parent Termination Fee and
Reverse Termination Fee are not intended to be a penalty, but rather are
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in
the circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee or Reverse Termination
Fee, as applicable, is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on

constitute a waiver of those rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

Section 10.4 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance_.

  

(a) This Agreement shall be construed, performed and enforced in accordance
with, and governed by, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the
application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other party(ies) hereto or its successors or assigns shall be
brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware, or in the event
(but only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, any state or federal court within
the State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits
with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its
property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the
courts set forth in this paragraph and agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than such courts. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect
to this Agreement, (i) any claim that is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts, (ii) any claim that it or its property
is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of Parent, Holdco, Merger Sub
1, Merger Sub 2 and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. To the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the parties hereto hereby consents
to the service of process in accordance with Section 10.7; _provided_ , that
nothing herein shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other matter permitted by Law.

  

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 10.4(b).

(c) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or were threatened not to be
performed, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at
law would be adequate is hereby waived. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement (in addition to any and all other rights and
remedies at law or in equity, and all such rights and remedies shall be
cumulative, except, in each case, as may be limited by Section 9.2). Any
requirements for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with or as
a condition to obtaining any such remedy are waived. Each of the parties
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an
adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any person at law or in equity.

  

Section 10.5 _Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Merger including all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all
other fees and expenses of third parties incurred by a party in connection

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be the obligation of
the respective party incurring such fees and expenses, except (a) Parent and
the Company shall each bear and pay one-half of the expenses incurred in
connection with (i) the filing, printing and mailing of the Registration

the Merger and this Agreement under the HSR Act, (b) as provided in Section
7.11, and Section 7.12 and (c) as provided in Section 9.2.

  

Section 10.6 _Severability; Construction_.

  

(a) In the event that any part of this Agreement is declared by any court or
other judicial or administrative body to be null, void or unenforceable, and
all of the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect, with no effect on the validity or enforceability of such other
provisions. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of such
provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (i)
a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (ii) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in any
other jurisdiction.

  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. If any ambiguity or question of intent arises, this Agreement
will be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or
burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party because of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

communications or documents to be given or made hereunder by any party to the
other parties to this Agreement shall be in writing and (a) served by personal
