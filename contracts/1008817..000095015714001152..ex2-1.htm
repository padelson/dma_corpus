The Offer

  


 

  

SECTION 1.01. The Offer. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and provided that this Agreement has not been terminated in
accordance with Article VIII and that the Company shall have complied with its
obligations under Section 1.01(b) and 1.02(c), as promptly as practicable (but
in no event later than ten business days after the date of this Agreement),
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence the Offer
within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
"Exchange Act"). The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause
Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer are subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Exhibit A (the
"Offer Conditions"). The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be 12:00
midnight, New York City time, on the 20th business day following the
commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the Exchange
Act). Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any Offer Condition or
modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the consent of the
Company, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, (i)
reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii)
reduce the Offer Price, (iii) waive, amend or modify the Minimum Tender
Condition or the Termination Condition, (iv) add to the Offer Conditions or
amend, modify or supplement any Offer Condition in any manner adverse to the
holders of Company Common Stock, (v) except as otherwise permitted under this
Agreement, terminate or extend the Offer, (vi) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (vii) otherwise amend, modify or
supplement any of the terms of the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders
of Company Common Stock in any material respect or (viii) provide any
"subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange
Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the parties' respective rights
to terminate this Agreement under Article VIII and provided that in no event
shall Merger Sub be required to extend the expiration date of the Offer to any
date later than the Outside Date, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, (A) extend the Offer for one or more consecutive increments of
not more than ten business days each (or for such longer period as may be
agreed by the Company), if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer any
of the Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall not
have been satisfied or waived, until such time as such conditions shall have
been satisfied or waived, and (B) extend the Offer for the minimum period
required by any Law, any rule, regulation or interpretation or position of the
SEC or the staff thereof or any rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Global
Market ("Nasdaq") applicable to the Offer. In addition, subject to the
parties' respective rights to terminate this Agreement under Article VIII, if
at the otherwise scheduled expiration date of the Offer each Offer Condition
(other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived
and the Minimum Tender Condition shall not have been satisfied, Merger Sub
may, and at the request of the Company, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer at the request of the Company for one or
more consecutive increments of not more than ten business days each (or for
such longer period as may be agreed by the Company); provided, that in no
event shall Merger Sub (1) be required or permitted to extend the expiration
date of the Offer to any date later than the Outside Date or (2) be required
or permitted to extend the expiration date of the Offer more than two times
pursuant to this sentence. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, accept for payment, and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable
after the expiration of the Offer and, in any event, no more than three
business days after the Acceptance Time. The time at which Merger Sub first
accepts for payment the shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer
is referred to as the "Acceptance Time". The Offer may not be terminated prior
to its expiration date (as such expiration date may be extended and re-
extended in accordance with this Section 1.01(a)), unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.01. If the Offer is terminated
or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 8.01, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository
acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered shares of Company
Common Stock to the registered holders thereof. Nothing contained in this
Section 1.01(a) shall affect any termination rights set forth in Section 8.01.

(b) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), Parent
and Merger Sub shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer,
which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal
and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein
pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or
amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents") and shall disseminate the Offer
Documents to the holders of Company Common Stock as and to the extent required
by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub
all information concerning the Company required by applicable Law to be set
forth in the Offer Documents or as reasonably requested by Parent, so as to
enable Parent and Merger Sub to comply with their respective obligations under
this Section 1.01(b). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to
cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and
shall inform the Company and its counsel of any oral comments, that Parent,
Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments. Prior to
the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement
thereto) with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company
Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the
Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents
or response (including the proposed final version thereof), and Parent and
Merger Sub shall give good faith consideration to any comments reasonably made
by the Company or its counsel.

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent and Merger Sub
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to the Offer such amounts as Parent or Merger Sub is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

  


 

  

(e) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring or
having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance
Time, in each case, effected in compliance with Section 5.01, and the Offer
Price as so adjusted shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.02. Company Actions. (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents
to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, the "Transactions").

  


 

  

(b) Subject to Section 5.03(e), on the date the Offer Documents are filed with
the SEC the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as
amended from time to time, the "Schedule 14D-9"), including the Company Board
Recommendation and a description thereof, and shall disseminate the Schedule
14D-9 to the holders of Company Common Stock as and to the extent required by
applicable Law, including by setting the Stockholder List Date as the record
date for purposes of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the
DGCL. The Schedule 14D-9 shall also contain the notice of appraisal required
to be delivered by the Company under Section 262(d) of the DGCL at the time
the Company first files the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub
shall furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub
required by applicable Law to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 or as
reasonably requested by the Company, so as to enable the Company to comply
with its obligations under this Section 1.02(b). Each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take
all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the
Schedule 14D-9, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall provide Parent and
its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform Parent and
its counsel of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
the receipt of such comments. Except with respect to any amendments filed
after an Adverse Recommendation Change or in connection with any disclosures
made in compliance with Section 5.03(e) or Section 5.03(f), prior to the
filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or supplement thereto)
with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Common
Stock, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule
14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response
(including the proposed final version thereof), and the Company shall give
good faith consideration to any comments reasonably made by Parent or its
counsel. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents
of the Company Board Recommendation and a description thereof (except to the
extent that the Company Board shall have previously withdrawn or modified the
Company Board Recommendation pursuant to and in accordance with Section
5.03(e)).

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
to promptly furnish Merger Sub with mailing labels containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of a recent date
and of those Persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together
with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings, computer
files and all other information in the Company's possession or control
regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to
Merger Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists of
stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent may
reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the Company's stockholders
(the date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom the Offer
Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the "Stockholder List
Date"). Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub
shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, lists,
listings, files and other information, shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company all copies of such
information.

  


 

  

(d) The Company shall register the transfer of shares of Company Common Stock
accepted for payment effective immediately after the Acceptance Time.

SECTION 2.01. The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the

Merger shall be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.02. Merger Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Merger Closing")
shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth
Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, as soon as
practicable following the Acceptance Time, subject to the satisfaction or (to
the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the
benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Merger Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the
party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of those conditions), or at
such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing by the parties
hereto. The date on which the Merger Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Merger Closing Date".

  


 

  

SECTION 2.03. Effective Time. Prior to the Merger Closing, the Company shall
prepare, and on the Merger Closing Date, the Company shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL to effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time
as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State or at
such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being referred to
herein as the "Effective Time").

  


 

  

SECTION 2.04. Effects of Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in Section 259 of the DGCL.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.05. Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. (a) At the Effective
Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as set forth in Exhibit B and, as so amended and
restated, such certificate of incorporation shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or permitted by applicable Law.

  


 

  

(b) The By-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or permitted by applicable Law, except
that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by the name of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

SECTION 2.06. Directors and Officers. (a) The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.

  


 

  

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.07. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  


 

  

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Company Common Stock
Held by Company Subsidiaries. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned
by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent as of
immediately prior to the commencement of the Offer shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock held by any Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the commencement of the Offer, if any, shall be converted
into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such
that each such Company Subsidiary owns the same amount of the outstanding
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time as such Company Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  


 

  

(c) Conversion of Other Company Common Stock. Subject to Sections 2.07(b) and
2.07(d), each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash,
without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.08, without interest.

  


 

  

(d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares ("Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.07(c), but instead shall be canceled
and shall represent the right to receive only those rights provided under
Section 262; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262, then the right of such holder to receive those rights under
Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall represent only the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.07(c). The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock and any withdrawals of any
such demands, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, or
otherwise negotiate any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

SECTION 2.08. Payment of Merger Consideration. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration to former holders of Company Common Stock.
Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to the Paying Agent, immediately after the Effective
Time, cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted
into the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 2.07(c) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

  


 

  

(b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time (but in no event later than five business days after the Effective Time),
the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(the "Certificates") or Book-Entry Shares which were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.07 (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as are customary and reasonably acceptable to the Company and
Parent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to the
Paying Agent for cancelation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable,
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into
which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.07, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable,
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.08, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, as applicable, have been converted pursuant to Section 2.07. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II as a result
of the conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II. No cash payment with respect to the Merger Consideration shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share until
the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this
Section 2.08.

  


 

  

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed as of the 12-month anniversary of the Merger Closing
Date shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former holder of
Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger Consideration who has not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

(e) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the 24-month anniversary of
the Merger Closing (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, immediately prior to such date become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, subject to the claims of any former holder of Company Common
Stock entitled to payment of Merger Consideration who has not theretofore
complied with this Article II.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent. To the extent that the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below
the level required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the Merger
Consideration to all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make
such payments.

  


 

  

(g) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount
as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration, without interest.

  


 

  

(h) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, Parent
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

  


 

  

ARTICLE III

  


 

  

Representations and Warranties of the Company

  


 

  

Except as disclosed in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents filed by the Company with, or furnished by the Company to, the SEC
since December 31, 2011 and publicly available prior to the date of this

contained in any part of any Filed Company SEC Document entitled "Risk
Factors," set forth in any "Forward-Looking Statements" disclaimer or that are
similarly cautionary, non-specific or predictive in nature) or as set forth in
the letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, from the Company to Parent
and Merger Sub (which shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this Article
III, and the disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify or apply to
other sections in this Article III to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent on its face that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such
other sections) (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), the Company represents and

existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent the concept is
recognized by such jurisdiction), except in the case of Company Subsidiaries
where any such failure would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (a) has full power and authority necessary to enable
it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct
its business as presently conducted, other than in the case of Company
Subsidiaries where any such failure would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect (or
in the case of the Company, would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole), and (b) is duly qualified or licensed to do business in
each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing
of its assets or properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
other than where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so
amended, the "Company Charter"), and the By-laws of the Company, as amended to
the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the "Company By-laws"), are
included in the Filed Company SEC Documents. The Company Charter and the
Company By-laws are in full force and effect and neither the Company nor any

to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and, assuming the representations and warranties set

contemplated by this Agreement are consummated in accordance with Section
251(h) of the DGCL, the consummation by the Company of the Transactions has

assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,
this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation,

decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of the Company to make the

threatened.

  


 

  

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of

letter as to such qualification or registration from the Internal Revenue

maintained and operated since January 1, 2005 in good faith compliance with
Section 409A of the Code and all applicable IRS guidance promulgated
thereunder so as to avoid any Tax, penalty or interest under Section 409A of
the Code and, as to any such Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement
in existence prior to January 1, 2005, has not been "materially modified"
(within the meaning of IRS Notice 2005-1) at any time after October 3, 2004 or
has been amended in a manner that conforms with the requirements of Section

applicable national security obligations and security measures required by
their Government Contracts or applicable Law and there are no facts or
circumstances that would, or would be reasonably likely to, result in the
suspension or termination of government security clearances or that would be
reasonably likely to render the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
ineligible for such security clearances in the future.

(except pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5.03 or 8.01) that would,
or would reasonably be expected to, result in any Offer Condition or any
condition to the Merger set forth in Article VII not being satisfied, or that
is intended to or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect or
materially delay the ability of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to perform
its covenants and agreements under this Agreement and in accordance therewith,
or to consummate the Transactions.

SECTION 5.03. No Solicitation. (a) The Company shall not, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and
employees not to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all of its
and their respective other Representatives not to, (A) directly or indirectly
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries
regarding, or the submission of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal, or (B)

Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that
any violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section
5.03 by any Company Subsidiary or any director, officer or employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any other Representative of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary that is authorized, instructed, sanctioned or
knowingly encouraged or caused to act by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary) shall be deemed a breach of this Section 5.03 by the Company.

  


 

  

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and
their respective directors, officers and employees to, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause all of its and their respective other
Representatives to, immediately (i) cease all discussions and negotiations
regarding any inquiry, proposal or offer pending on the date of this Agreement

Takeover Proposal, (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished to any Person within the last
twelve months for the purposes of evaluating a possible Company Takeover
Proposal and (iii) terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms
relating to a possible Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall not, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, release any Person from, or
waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, (A) any
standstill provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries is a party or (B) any confidentiality provision in any
agreement to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party;
provided, that this clause (B) shall not prohibit any waiver, amendment,
modification or permission under a confidentiality provision that does not,
and would not reasonably be expected to, facilitate or encourage a possible
Company Takeover Proposal. Except to the extent otherwise permitted by the
proviso in the foregoing sentence, the Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries to, enforce the confidentiality and standstill provisions
of any such agreement.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.03(a) or
5.03(b) or any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, (x) the Company may contact the Person making any Company
Takeover Proposal solely to refer them to the terms of this Section 5.03 and
(y) in response to a bona fide, written Company Takeover Proposal that did not
result from a breach of this Section 5.03, and that the Company Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Company Proposal and that the failure to take such action would
violate the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law (a "Qualifying
Company Takeover Proposal"), the Company may (A) furnish information with
respect to the Company to the Person making such Qualifying Company Takeover
Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement so long as the Company also provides Parent, prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time such information is provided or made
available to such Person, in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, any non-public information with respect to the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries furnished to such other Person which was not previously
furnished to Parent, and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with
such Person and its Representatives regarding such Qualifying Company Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall promptly notify Parent if the Company furnishes
non-public information and/or enters into discussions or negotiations as
provided in this Section 5.03(c).

  


 

  

(d) The Company shall as promptly as practicable advise Parent in writing of
the Company's or any of the Company Subsidiaries' or its or their respective
Representatives' receipt of any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with
respect to or that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company
Takeover Proposal and the identity of the Person making, and all material
terms and conditions (including an unredacted copy or, if such Company
Takeover Proposal is not in writing, a written description of such material
terms and conditions) of, any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of
the status of, and any material developments regarding, any such Company
Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including by promptly providing to Parent copies
of any written proposals, indications of interest and/or draft agreements
relating to such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry or changes to the
material terms thereof). The Company agrees that it and the Company
Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any Person which prohibits
the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with, or
otherwise complying with, this Section 5.03.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(e) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or
propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent
or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, or resolve or agree to take
any such action, (B) adopt, endorse, approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to adopt, endorse, approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal, or
resolve or agree to take any such action, (C) following the date any Company
Takeover Proposal or any material modification thereto is first made public or
sent or given to the stockholders of the Company, fail to issue a press
release reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation within five business days
after a request by Parent to do so (or, if earlier, by the second business day
prior to the then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer) or (D) fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 when
disseminated to the Company's stockholders (any action described in this
clause (i) being referred to herein as an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or
(ii) approve, or authorize, cause or permit the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option agreement, merger
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement
relating to any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this Section 5.03)
(a "Company Acquisition Agreement"), or resolve, agree or publicly propose to
take any such action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, prior to the Acceptance
Time, the Company Board may, subject to compliance with the other provisions
of this Section 5.03, (I) make an Adverse Recommendation Change under clause
(A) or (D) of the definition thereof in response to an Intervening Event (and
not in response to a Company Takeover Proposal), if the Company Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that prior to making
such Adverse Recommendation Change, (1) the Company gives Parent at least four
business days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, (2) the Company
negotiates, and uses reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms
of this Agreement such that it would permit the Company Board not to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.03(e)(I), and (3)
upon the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall consider in good
faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent, and determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel
and its financial advisor, that the Company Board's failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change under clause (A) or (D) of the definition thereof would
continue to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (II) if the
Company Board receives a Superior Company Proposal that did not result from a
breach of this Section 5.03, provided that the Company Board determines, in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor,
that the failure to take such action would violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, make an Adverse Recommendation Change, and/or terminate this
Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such
Superior Company Proposal pursuant to Section 8.01(f) and subject to
compliance with Section 8.04(b); provided, however, that prior to so making an
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement, (1) the Company
gives Parent at least four business days' prior written notice of its
intention to take such action, specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons
therefor, including the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of
the Person making, any such Superior Company Proposal and a copy of the
Superior Company Proposal and any proposed Company Acquisition Agreements and
financing commitments relating thereto, (2) the Company negotiates, and uses
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to negotiate, in good
faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Company Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Company Proposal, (3) upon the end of such notice
period, the Company Board considers in good faith any revisions to the terms
of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and determines, in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor, that
the Superior Company Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Company
Proposal even if the revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect and
(4) in the event of any change to any of the financial terms (including the
form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material
terms of such Superior Company Proposal, the Company shall, in each case,
deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in
clause (1) of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (1) of this
proviso shall commence (except that the four business day notice period
referred to in clause (1) of this proviso shall instead be equal to the longer
of (x) two business days and (y) the period remaining under the notice period
under clause (1) of this proviso immediately prior to the delivery of such
additional notice under this clause (4)) during which time the Company shall
be required to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.03(e)(II) anew
with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (1) through (4) of
this proviso; provided further, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall enter into any
Company Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company
Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
the failure to take such action would violate its fiduciary duties or
applicable Law; provided that any Adverse Recommendation Change will be
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (it being understood
that (A) any "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act and (B) any accurate
disclosure of factual information to the Company's stockholders that describes
the Company's receipt of a Company Takeover Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto and contains a statement that the Company Board
has not effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, shall not, in and of
itself, be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change).

recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, binding share exchange or similar
transaction involving the Company or (B) tender offer, exchange offer or

surviving entity or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or
such surviving entity, or (iii) any combination of the foregoing, other than,

foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, but the
consequences of which were not.

Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisor, are more favorable to the stockholders of
the Company from a financial point of view than the Transactions, taking into
account all the terms and conditions (including all financial, regulatory,
financing, conditionality, legal and other terms and conditions) of such
proposal and this Agreement and (B) that the Company Board determines is
reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, taking into account

Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall be effected by Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time without a
stockholders meeting pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall, or
shall cause its applicable subsidiary to, as sole stockholder of Merger Sub,

SECTION 6.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. Except if prohibited by
any applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parent's Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours (under the supervision of appropriate
personnel and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operation of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) during
the period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective properties,
books and records, Contracts and personnel and, during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, furnish, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, to Parent copies of all correspondence
between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any party to a Contract with
regard to any action, consent, approval or waiver that is actually or
purportedly required to be taken or obtained with respect to such Contract in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions and all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request; provided, however, that any reasonable out-of-pocket and documented
expenses arising from affording any such access or furnishing any such
information shall be paid by Parent. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be
required to afford access or furnish information to the extent (a) such
information is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a
third party, (b) relating to the applicable portions of the minutes of the

prepared by or for the Company Board) where the Company Board discussed the
Transactions or any similar transaction involving the sale of the Company to,
or combination of the Company with, any other Person or (c) the Company
determines in good faith that affording such access or furnishing such
information would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries or violate applicable Law; provided, in the
case of clauses (a) and (c), that the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements to afford such access or
furnish such information without breaching such confidentiality agreement,
jeopardizing such attorney-client privilege or violating applicable Law, as

subject to the confidentiality letter agreement dated October 25, 2014,
between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). No
investigation by Parent or its Representatives shall affect or be deemed to
modify or waive the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.03. Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification. (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all
necessary or advisable actions or non-actions, waivers and Consents from, the
making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with and the
taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid a Proceeding by
any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions,

administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed

to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company

Subsidiaries to, (A) take all action necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
any Transaction or this Agreement and (B) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation becomes or purports to be applicable to any
Transaction or this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on the Transactions and this Agreement.

Company shall, in consultation and cooperation with the other, (i) file, as
promptly as practicable (but in no event later than ten business days after
the date of this Agreement), with the United States Federal Trade Commission

assistance as the other party may request in connection with its preparation
of any filing or submission which is necessary under the HSR Act, the Clayton
Act, as amended (the "Clayton Act"), the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended (the "FTC Act") or any Foreign Merger Control Law, the Exon-Florio
Amendment or any FOCI Requirements, (x) give the other party reasonable prior
notice of any such filings or submissions and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, of any communication with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other Governmental
Entity regarding the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and
permit the other party to

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of, and
secure the participation of, the other party in connection with, any such
filings, submissions, communications, inquiries or requests, (y) unless
prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity, and to

Entity in respect of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions
without the other party, (B) give the other party reasonable prior notice of

submissions, correspondence and communications (and memoranda setting forth
the substance thereof) between it and its affiliates and their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
any Governmental Entity's staff, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications
received or provided by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of
their respective affiliates, from or to any third party and/or Governmental
Entity, and (z) comply with any inquiry or request from the FTC, the DOJ or
any other Governmental Entity as promptly as reasonably practicable. Any such
additional information shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act, the applicable Foreign Merger Control Law, the
Exon-Florio Amendment or the applicable FOCI Requirements, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this Section 6.03(b) as "Antitrust
Counsel Only Material, " which such material and the information contained
therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient
and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be)
or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Section 6.03, materials provided pursuant to this Section 6.03 may be
redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and the
Merger or other confidential information, as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements and as necessary to address reasonable privilege
concerns, and to remove personal and confidential information provided in
connection with CFIUS and/or FOCI Requirement review.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the parties' obligations under Sections
6.03(a) and 6.03(b), Parent shall, solely to the extent necessary to permit
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(a) (to the extent any
such Judgment is in respect of, or any such Law is, the HSR Act, the Clayton
Act, the FTC Act or any Foreign Merger Control Law, the Exon-Florio Amendment
or a FOCI Requirement) and clauses (b) and (i) of Exhibit A (to the extent any
such Judgment is in respect of, or any such Law is, the HSR Act, the Clayton
Act, the FTC Act or any Foreign Merger Control Law, the Exon-Florio Amendment
or a FOCI Requirement) so as to permit the Acceptance Time to occur prior to
the Outside Date, propose, negotiate, commit and agree to the sale,
divestiture, license, holding separate (including by proxy agreement), or
other disposition of or restriction on the products, assets or businesses of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, or other mitigation in respect of the
products, assets or businesses of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
required by, CFIUS in connection with the Exon-Florio Amendment, by the U.S.
Defense Security Service or U.S. Department of Energy or any other
Governmental Entity in connection with the FOCI Requirements or by any
Governmental Entity in connection with the HSR Act, the Clayton Act, the FTC
Act or any Foreign Merger Control Law; provided, that any such sales,
divestitures, licenses, holdings separate, dispositions or restrictions or
other mitigation become effective only from and after the Acceptance Time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall
require Parent (or permit the Company, without Parent's prior written consent)
to take or agree or commit to take any such action, or agree to any condition
or restriction or other mitigation, involving the Company or Parent or their
respective subsidiaries, that would be, or would reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material in relation to the businesses of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, regardless of
whether any such action, condition, restriction or mitigation is in respect of
Parent, the Company or their respective subsidiaries (any such action,
condition, restriction or mitigation, a "Burdensome Condition"), it being
agreed that any sale, divestiture, license, holding separate or other
disposition of, or restriction on, or other mitigation action required by,
CFIUS, or the U.S. Defense Security Service or U.S. Department of Energy or
any other Governmental Entity in connection with the FOCI Requirements, with
respect to all or any portion of the products, assets, contracts or businesses
of, or capital stock of the subsidiary or subsidiaries of the Company
conducting, the Sapient Government Services unit of the Company shall be
deemed not to constitute, collectively, in and of themselves, a Burdensome
Condition. Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall require the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to its
business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is
conditioned upon the Acceptance Time, or permit the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to take or agree to any action or other matter pursuant
to this Section 6.03 referred to in this Section 6.03(c) above without
Parent's prior written consent.

as may be required to effect the following:

  


 

  

(i) each Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, outstanding
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall be canceled at the Acceptance
Time, with the holder of such Company Stock Option becoming entitled to
receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Offer
Price over (2) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time; and

  


 

  

(ii) each Company Restricted Stock Unit and each Company Performance
Restricted Stock Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time
shall be canceled at the Acceptance Time, with the holder of such Company
Restricted Stock Unit or such Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit
becoming entitled, subject to Section 6.04(d), to receive an amount in cash
equal to the sum of (A)(1) the Offer Price multiplied by (2) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit
or such Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit (as applicable) immediately
prior to the Acceptance Time (assuming, in the case of any Company Performance
Restricted Stock Unit, that any applicable performance conditions are deemed
to be achieved at maximum performance level) and (B) any accrued and unpaid
cash dividend equivalents with respect to such Company Restricted Stock Unit
or such Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit.

  


 

  

(b) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be subject to any
required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without interest.

  


 

  

(c) Subject to Section 6.04(b) and to Section 6.04(d), promptly following the
Merger Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
through its payroll systems all amounts payable pursuant to Section 6.04(a) to
the former holders of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units,
Company Performance Restricted Stock Units, as applicable; provided, however,
that, to the extent any such amounts relate to a Company Stock Option, Company
Restricted Stock Unit or Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit that
constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the
Code, such amounts shall be paid at the earliest time permitted under the
terms of the applicable agreement or Company Stock Plan relating to such
Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Stock Unit or Company Performance
Restricted Stock Unit that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section
409A of the Code.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.04, the
provisions of Section 6.04(a)(ii) shall apply to Company Restricted Stock
Units and Company Performance Restricted Stock Units held by an individual
listed on Section 6.04(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, a
"Specified Executive") only if the applicable Specified Executive executes, no
later than 45 days following the date hereof, a letter agreement with Parent
substantially consistent with the terms set forth as Section 6.04(d)(ii) of
the Company Disclosure Letter. In the event that a Specified Executive does
not execute such letter agreement within 45 days following the date hereof,
each Company Restricted Stock Unit and Company Performance Restricted Stock
Unit (as applicable) held by such Specified Executive shall be cancelled as of
the Acceptance Time and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in
the amount that would otherwise be payable pursuant to Section 6.04(c);
provided that the right to such cash payment shall be conditioned on such
Specified Executive's continued employment with the Company and its Affiliates
through the date or dates that the corresponding Company Restricted Stock Unit
or Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit (as applicable) would otherwise
have become vested based on the Specified Executive's continued service (such
date, the "Service Vesting Dates") and each installment of such payment shall
be made promptly following the applicable Service Vesting Date. In the event
of a termination of the applicable Specified Executive's employment prior to
the final Service Vesting Date, the right to such cash payment shall be
forfeited; provided that to the extent that a Specified Executive is party to
a Change in Control Severance Agreement providing for accelerated vesting of
equity compensation awards upon a qualifying termination of employment, such
cash payment shall be accelerated upon any such termination of employment and
shall be made promptly following the date thereof.

  


 

  

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

  


 

  

(i) "Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit" means any restricted stock
unit award subject to performance-based vesting, payable in shares of Company
Common Stock or the value of which is determined with reference to the value
of shares of Company Common Stock, whether granted under a Company Stock Plan
or otherwise.

  


 

  

(ii) "Company Restricted Stock Unit" means any restricted stock unit award
subject to time-based vesting (including any award that was previously a
Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit but immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time is subject only to time-based vesting conditions) payable in
shares of Company Common Stock or the value of which is determined with
reference to the value of shares of Company Common Stock, whether granted
under a Company Stock Plan or otherwise.

  


 

  

(iii) "Company Stock Option" means any option to purchase Company Common Stock
granted under a Company Stock Plan or otherwise.

  


 

  

(iv) "Company Stock Plans" means the Company's 1996 Equity Stock Incentive
Plan, 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, 2001 Stock Option plan and 2011 Incentive
Plan, in each case, as amended.

SECTION 6.05. Employee Matters. (a) For a period of 18 months following the
Effective Time (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide or cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide to each individual who is employed by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, a "Company Employee") and remains employed following the Effective Time
(i) a base salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable, that is no less
favorable than that provided to such Company Employee by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) severance
benefits that are no less favorable than those provided to such Company
Employee by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (iii) short-term and long-term incentive opportunities that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such Company
Employee by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time (taking into account for such purposes performance conditions
and risk); provided that each Company Employee who, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, has a title that is at the level of vice-president of the
Company or above shall be provided with long-term incentives in the form of
equity compensation in respect of Parent common stock and (iv) employee
benefits that are substantially comparable to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its affiliates. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
welfare plans of Parent and its subsidiaries to the extent coverage under any
such plan replaces coverage under a comparable plan in which such Company
Employee participates immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.05(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
assume, honor and continue during the Continuation Period or, if later, until
all obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Company's
employment, severance, retention, termination and change in control plans,
policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including any change in
control severance agreement or other Company Benefit Agreement between the
Company and any Company Employee) maintained by the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect at the Effective Time, including with
respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the
Transactions (either alone or in combination with any other event), without
any amendment or modification, other than any amendment or modification
permitted pursuant to the terms of the applicable plan, policy, program
agreement or arrangement or required to comply with applicable Law.

  


 

  

(c) With respect to any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its respective subsidiaries (including
any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans), for all purposes, including
determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting, benefit
accruals and early retirement subsidies, each Company Employee's service with
the Company or any Company Subsidiaries (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Company or any such Company Subsidiary, to the
extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or
such Company Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such service need not
be recognized for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan, for any purpose under any retiree medical plan or to the extent
that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same
period of service.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries in which any Company Employee is eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and
cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions and waiting periods and actively-at-work
requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries,
to the extent such limitations were waived, satisfied or did not apply to such
employees or eligible dependents or beneficiaries under the corresponding
welfare Company Benefit Plan in which such employees participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide Company Employees and their
eligible dependents and beneficiaries with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous
deductible or out-of-pocket maximum requirements to the extent applicable
under any such plan.

  


 

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.05 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Company Employee or any other Person
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any
purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement (except to the extent
provided in Section 9.07 with respect to Section 6.06), and no provision of
this Section 6.05 shall create such rights in any such Persons in respect of
any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or any employee program or any plan
or arrangement of Parent or any of its subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall be
construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan, Company Benefit
Agreement or plan, program, policy, agreement, arrangement or understanding of
Parent.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.06. Indemnification. (a) All rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights to advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of any Person who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been
at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, a director, officer, employee
or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan)
of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors (each, an "Indemnified Party") as provided in the Company
Charter, the Company By-laws, the organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of
this Agreement (i) shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the
Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time, (ii) shall survive the
Merger, (iii) shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms with respect to any claims against any such Indemnified Party arising
out of such acts or omissions and (iv) shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. Parent shall ensure that the
Surviving Corporation complies with and honors the foregoing obligations.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting Section 6.06(a) or any rights of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification agreement as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, from and after the Acceptance Time, in the event of any threatened
or actual Proceeding, whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee
benefit plan) of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation
shall, indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law upon
receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or
actual Proceeding. None of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual
Proceeding for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party
hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to
such settlement, compromise or consent. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall at their own expense cooperate with an Indemnified Party in the defense
of any such Proceeding. Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's obligations
under this Section 6.06(b) shall continue in full force and effect for the
period beginning upon the Acceptance Time and ending six years from the
Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any Proceeding asserted or made within such period shall continue
until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

  


 

  

(c) The Company may obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or
"tail") directors' and officers' liability insurance policies in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions) for the period beginning upon the
Acceptance Time and ending six years from the Effective Time, covering each
Indemnified Party and containing terms (including with respect to coverage and
amounts) and conditions (including with respect to deductibles and exclusions)
that are, individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any
Indemnified Party than those of the Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies in effect on the date of this Agreement (the
"Existing DandO Policies"); provided, however, that the maximum aggregate annual
premium for such "tail" insurance policies for any such year shall not exceed
the maximum aggregate annual premium contemplated by the second succeeding
sentence. If such "tail" insurance policies have been obtained by the Company,
Parent shall cause such "tail" insurance policies to be maintained in full
force and effect, for their full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to
be honored by it and the Surviving Corporation. In the event the Company does
not obtain such "tail" insurance policies, then, for the period beginning upon
the Acceptance Time and ending six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain in effect the Existing DandO Policies in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions); provided, however, that neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium
for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the annual premium payable by
the Company for coverage for its current fiscal year under the Existing DandO
Policies (which amount the Company represents and warrants is set forth in
Section 6.06(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter); provided further that if
the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain the most advantageous
policy available for an annual premium equal to such amount; and provided
further that Parent may substitute therefor policies of a reputable and
financially sound insurance company containing terms (including with respect
to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including with respect to deductibles
and exclusions) that are, individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable
to any Indemnified Party.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(d) In the event that (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties and other assets to any Person or (ii) Parent or any
of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.06.

  


 

  

(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.06 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.06 applies without the
consent of such affected Indemnified Party. The provisions of this Section
6.06 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to which each
Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

  


 

  

(f) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided in this Section 6.06.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.07. Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as set forth in Section 6.02,
Section 6.06, this Section 6.07, Section 6.09 and Section 6.14(c), all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or
expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated.

  


 

  

(b) In the event that:

  


 

  

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f);

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d); or

  


 

  

(iii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, a Company Takeover Proposal is
made directly to the stockholders of the Company or otherwise becomes publicly
known, or any Person publicly proposes or announces an intention to make a
Company Takeover Proposal, in each case that is not publicly withdrawn prior
to the fourth business day prior to the final expiration date of the Offer,
(B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) (in the case of such a termination pursuant to
Section 8.01(b)(i), if the Minimum Tender Condition is not satisfied at the
final expiration date of the Offer) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c)
and (C) within twelve months of such termination (1) any transaction included
within the definition of Company Takeover Proposal is consummated or (2) the
Company or any Company Subsidiary enters into a definitive agreement to
consummate any transaction within the definition of Company Takeover Proposal
(whether or not involving the same Company Takeover Proposal, or the Person
making the Company Takeover Proposal, referred to in clause (A)),

  


 

  

then the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) a fee of $125,000,000
(the "Company Termination Fee"). For purposes of Section 6.07(b)(iii), the
term "Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term
in Section 5.03(g), except that all references to 20% in such definition shall
be deemed references to 50%. Any fee due under this Section 6.07(b) shall be
paid by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account designated by Parent,
(1) in the case of clause (i) above, prior to or simultaneously with such
termination of this Agreement, (2) in the case of clause (ii) above, within
two business days after the date of such termination of this Agreement and (3)
in the case of clause (iii) above, within two business days after the earlier
of (x) the date of the consummation of the transaction referred to in clause
(C)(1) thereof or (y) the date of entry into the definitive agreement referred
to in clause (C)(2) thereof. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in
no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on
more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be
payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and the occurrence of different events.

  


 

  

(c) Acceptance by Parent of the fee due under Section 6.07(b)(i) shall
constitute acceptance by Parent of the validity of any termination of this
Agreement under Section 8.01(f) and payment of the Company Termination Fee
described in this Section 6.07 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
their respective current, former or future Representatives for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and
upon payment of the Company Termination Fee, none of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective current, former or future
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except, in each case, in
the case of fraud.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee
is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which
such Termination Fee is due and payable and which do not involve fraud, for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Each of the
parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 6.07(b)
and this Section 6.07(d) are an integral part of the Transactions, and that,
without these agreements, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter
into this Agreement, and, accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely
manner any amount due pursuant to Section 6.07(b), then (i) the Company shall
reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and fees
of counsel) incurred in the successful collection of such overdue amount,
including in connection with any successful Proceedings commenced with respect
thereto and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such amount from
and including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the
date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2%.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.08. Public Announcements. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before
issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon,
any press release or other public statements with respect to the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
except (a) as required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national or foreign securities
exchange, (b) as permitted or required by Section 5.03 or (c) for press
releases or other public statements that are substantially consistent with
prior press releases or other public statements made by the parties in
compliance with this Section 6.08. The parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be in the form
heretofore agreed to by the parties.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.09. Transfer Taxes. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 2.08(b)
or otherwise in this Agreement, all stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such Taxes) ("Transfer Taxes") incurred in
connection with the Transactions shall be paid by either Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, and the Company shall cooperate with Merger Sub and
Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such
Transfer Taxes.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.10. Stockholder Litigation. Prior to the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, the Company shall promptly advise
Parent of any stockholder litigation of which the Company is aware against the
Company or its directors or executive officers relating to any Transaction,
shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such stockholder
litigation and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense
of any such stockholder litigation provided, however, that the Company shall
control the defense of such litigation and this Section 6.10 shall not give
Parent the right to direct such defense; and provided, further, that no
settlement of any such litigation shall be agreed to or offered by the Company
or its Representatives without Parent's written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

SECTION 6.11. Rule 14d-10 Matters. Prior to the scheduled expiration of the
Offer, the Company (acting through the Company Board and its Compensation
Committee (each member of which the Company Board determined is an
"independent" director within the meaning of the applicable Nasdaq rules and
shall be an "independent" director in accordance with the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time of the following action))
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause each plan, program,
agreement, arrangement or understanding that has been, or after the date of
this Agreement will be, entered into by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries with current or future directors, officers or employees of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to which compensation is
paid or payable, or severance or other benefits are provided, to such
director, officer or employee to be approved as an Employment Compensation
Arrangement and to otherwise satisfy the safe harbor provisions of Rule
14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.12. Rule 16b-3 Matters. The Company shall take all reasonable steps
as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company equity securities
(including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to Section 16
of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.13. Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation Compliance. Parent shall
cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to comply with
all of its respective obligations under this Agreement and Merger Sub shall
not engage in any activities of any nature except as provided in or
contemplated by this Agreement (or ancillary thereto or in furtherance
thereof).

  


 

  

SECTION 6.14. Financing and Financing Cooperation. (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to, provide such reasonable cooperation in
connection with any financing by Parent or any of its subsidiaries in
connection with the Transactions as may be requested by Parent, Merger Sub or
their Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, upon request (i) furnish the report of the Company's
auditor on the most recently available audited consolidated financial
statements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the consent of such auditor to the use of such report
in accordance with normal custom and practice and use reasonable best efforts
to cause such auditor to provide customary comfort letters to the
underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents, as applicable, in
connection with any such financing; (ii) furnish any additional financial
statements, schedules or other financial data relating to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent and required in
connection with any such financing (including, if applicable, any such

financial statements); (iii) provide direct contact between (A) senior

employees and advisors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to provide
reasonable assistance with Parent's preparation of business projections,

connection with applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001),
authorization letters, opinions and certificates, enter into agreements
(including supplemental indentures) and take other actions that are or may be
customary in connection with the financing or necessary or desirable to permit
Parent to fulfill conditions or obligations under the financing documents,
provided that such agreements entered into shall be conditioned upon, and
shall not take effect until, the Effective Time; (vii) reasonably assist in
the preparation of one or more confidential information memoranda,
prospectuses, offering memoranda and other marketing and syndication materials
reasonably requested by Parent; (viii) permit Parent's reasonable use of the
Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' logos for syndication and

58  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain customary
payoff letters from third-party lenders and trustees with respect to the
indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries specified by Parent
to the Company no later than ten business days prior to the Acceptance Time
and (ii) deliver or cause to be delivered such payoff letters to Parent at the
Acceptance Time. At the Effective Time, subject to Parent making available
necessary funds to do so, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, permanently (A) terminate the
credit facilities requested by Parent to be so terminated, if and to the
extent such facilities are specified by Parent to the Company no later than
ten business days prior to the Acceptance Time, and all related contracts to
which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party and (B) cause
to be released any Liens on its assets relating to such terminated credit
facilities.

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.14 to the contrary, in
fulfilling its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.14, (i) none of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives shall be
required to pay any commitment or other fee, provide any security or incur any
other liability in connection with any financing prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the

(c) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its

materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect), which breach or failure to
perform (i) would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (ii) has not been cured prior to the
earlier of (x) 30 days after the giving of written notice to Parent or Merger
Sub of such breach and (y) the Outside Date (provided that the Company is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained
in this Agreement); or

  


 

  

(f) by the Company in accordance with Section 8.04(b).

Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand,
or the Company, on the other hand (except liability arising out of or
resulting from fraud or the willful and material breach by a party of any
provision set forth in this Agreement), other than Section 1.02(c), Section

after the Acceptance Time, (1) there shall be made no amendment to this
Agreement that decreases the Merger Consideration and (2) termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(a) and any amendments to this Agreement
shall require, in addition to the consent of Parent and Merger Sub, the
consent of the Company Board and, at the time of such consent, either (x) a
majority of the directors on the Company Board shall have been directors on
the Company Board on the date hereof or shall have been nominated or
designated to be directors by a majority of the directors on the Company Board
on the date hereof (such directors, "Continuing Directors") or (y) if the
Continuing Directors constitute a minority of the Board of Directors, each
Continuing Director shall approve such termination or amendment and (B) no
amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the Effective Time; provided,
however, that any amendment of (i) this proviso, (ii) clause (2) of Section
9.07(a) or (iii) Section 9.10(c), Section 9.10(d) or Section 9.11 shall not
affect the Debt Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the
Debt Financing Sources (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

  


 

  

(b) This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any extension or waiver with respect to this Agreement shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 or an amendment of this
Agreement or an extension or waiver with respect to this Agreement pursuant to

authorized designee of its Board of Directors. Termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01 shall not require the approval of the stockholders of
the Company.

  


 

  

(b) The Company may terminate this Agreement under Section 8.01(f) only if
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5.03(e)(II), including that (i) the
Company Board has received a Superior Company Proposal and the Company enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to the applicable Superior Company
Proposal concurrently with the termination of this Agreement and (ii) the
Company has paid, or simultaneously with the termination of this Agreement

supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,

the Offer or the Merger, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that
neither the Company nor any Person on behalf of the Company makes any other
express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information made
available to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions. Neither
the Company nor any other Person will have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person resulting
from the distribution to Parent or Merger Sub, or Parent's or Merger Sub's use
of, any such information, including any information, documents, projections,
forecasts or other material made available to Parent or Merger Sub in certain
"data rooms" or management presentations in expectation of the Transactions,
unless and then only to the extent of the representations and warranties
contained in Article III.

  


 

  

(c) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article IV, the
Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person on

representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or with
respect to any other information made available to the Company in connection
with the Transactions.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.08. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.09. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that either Parent or
Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to Parent (in the case of
Merger Sub) or to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent,
but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, of
any of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

SECTION 9.10. Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction. (a) The parties acknowledge
and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any
other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in Section 9.10(b),
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy
(and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The right to specific
enforcement shall include the right of each party to cause the other party (or
parties) to cause the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions to be
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without such right, none of the parties would have entered
into this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such
court shall be unavailable, any state or Federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware) for the purpose of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to such
Proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in such court. Each of the
parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall be
unavailable, any state or Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) in
the event any Proceeding arises out of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (iii) irrevocably consents to the service of process in any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other Transactions, on behalf of itself or its property, in
accordance with Section 9.02 (provided that nothing in this Section 9.10(b)
shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law) and (iv) agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding
relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, if such court shall be unavailable, any state or Federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware). The parties hereto agree that a final trial
court judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any
party's rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from,
such final trial court judgment.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 9.08 or 9.10(b) to the contrary, each
of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any Proceeding
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the
lenders or any other Persons that have committed to provide the debt financing
(the "Debt Financing") to be incurred pursuant to that certain commitment
letter (together with the related fee letter), dated November 1, 2014, between
the Parent and Citibank, N.A., London Branch (as amended, supplemented or
replaced, the "Debt Commitment Letter") or other financings in connection with
the Transactions (each such Person, a "Debt Financing Source") in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including any dispute

Offer Conditions

  


 

  


 

  

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub
to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger
Sub's obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock
promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any
shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer if (a) there
shall not have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration
of the Offer that number of shares of Company Common Stock which would
represent at least a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (the "Minimum Tender Condition") or (b) (w) any waiting period (or
extension thereof) under the HSR Act applicable to the purchase of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger
shall have neither expired nor been terminated, (x) any waiting period (or
extension thereof) under any applicable Foreign Merger Control Law in any of
the jurisdictions set forth in Schedule 1 hereto applicable to the purchase of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of
the Merger shall have neither expired nor been terminated, or any required
approval with respect thereto shall not have been obtained, (y) the parties
shall not have executed a commitment letter setting forth the terms of, or
otherwise reached agreement on, a FOCI mitigation plan that is acceptable to
the U.S. Defense Security Service and the U.S. Department of Energy and any
other applicable Governmental Entity in connection with the FOCI Requirements,
as applicable, that does not impose any Burdensome Condition, or (z) if a
filing with CFIUS is made pursuant to Section 6.03(b), none of the following
shall have occurred: (A) written confirmation has been obtained from CFIUS
that it has completed its review or, if applicable, investigation, under the
Exon-Florio Amendment, and determined that there are no unresolved national
security concerns with respect to the Transactions, (B) following an
investigation, CFIUS shall have reported the Transactions to the President of
the United States and the President of the United States shall have declined
to exercise his authorities under the Exon-Florio Amendment to suspend or
prohibit the Transactions or (C) following an investigation, CFIUS shall have
reported the Transactions to the President of the United States and the
President of the United States shall have determined to take action that would
not, and would not reasonably be expected to, result (individually or in the
aggregate with any other action, agreement, condition, restriction or
mitigation that counts towards whether a Burdensome Condition has occurred
pursuant to the definition thereof and Section 6.03(c)) in a Burdensome
Condition. Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be
required to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment or, subject as aforesaid,
to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock not theretofore accepted for
payment or paid for if, at the expiration of the Offer, any of the following
conditions exists or has occurred and is continuing:

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(i) there shall be any Legal Restraint in effect preventing or prohibiting the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger;

  


 

  

(ii) (A) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in Article
III (other than those set forth in Sections 3.01 (first sentence only), 3.02,
3.03(b) (except the last two sentences thereof), 3.04, 3.08(a) and 3.20) shall
not be true and correct at such time as though made on and as of such date,
except to the extent such representation and warranty expressly relates to a
specified date (in which case on and as of such specified date), other than
for such failures to be true and correct that would not reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect
(for purposes of determining the satisfaction of this condition, without
regard to any "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect"
qualifications and exceptions contained therein), (B) any representation and
warranty of the Company set forth in Section 3.02(a) or 3.02(c) shall not be
true and correct at such time as though made on and as of such date, except to
the extent such representation and warranty expressly relates to a specified
date (in which case on and as of such specified date), except for any de
minimis inaccuracies (for purposes of determining the satisfaction of this
condition, without regard to any "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse
Effect" qualifications and exceptions contained therein), (C) any
representation and warranty of the Company set forth in Section 3.01 (first
sentence only), 3.02(b), 3.02(d), 3.02(e), 3.03(b) (except the last two
sentences thereof), 3.04 or 3.20 shall not be true and correct in all material
respects (for purposes of determining the satisfaction of this condition,
without regard to any "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect"
qualifications and exceptions contained therein) at such time as though made
on and as of such date, except to the extent such representation and warranty
expressly relates to a specified date (in which case on and as of such
specified date), and (D) any representation and warranty of the Company set
forth in Section 3.08(a) shall not be true and correct in all respects at such
time as though made on and as of such date;

  


 

  

(iii) the Company shall have failed to perform in all material respects all
obligations to be performed by it as of such time under this Agreement;

  


 

  

(iv) Merger Sub shall have failed to receive from the Company a certificate,
dated the expiration date of the offer and signed by its Chief Executive
Officer or Chief Financial Officer, certifying to the effect that the
conditions set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii) have not occurred; or

  


 

  

(v) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms
(the "Termination Condition").

  


 

  

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub in
whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion
(other than the Minimum Tender Condition and the Termination Condition). The
failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.
