Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Option") granted under or pursuant to
the Company Incentive Plans other than a Company Option granted pursuant to
the UK Employees Subplan (the treatment of which is set forth in Section
2.5(a)(ii)), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior
to the First Viper Effective Time shall be converted into two options (each a
"Converted Company Option"), one entitling its holder to acquire, upon
exercise, a number of Series A Holdco Shares equal to the product of the
number of the shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option
multiplied by 0.4123 and the other entitling its holder to acquire, upon
exercise, a number of Series C Holdco Shares equal to the product of the
number of shares subject to the Company Option multiplied by 0.3077 (in each
case, rounded down to the nearest whole share). The exercise price of each
Converted Company Option in respect of Series A Holdco Shares shall be equal
to the amount (rounded up to two decimal points) obtained by dividing the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock to which such Company Option
was subject immediately prior to the First Viper Effective Time by 0.7200 and
adding the resulting product of (a) $4.00 multiplied by (b) the quotient of
0.3077 divided by 0.7200. The exercise price of each Converted Company Option
in respect of Series C Holdco Shares shall be equal to the amount (rounded up
to two decimal points) obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock to which such Company Option was subject immediately
prior to the First Viper Effective Time by 0.7200 and subtracting the
resulting product of (a) $4.00 multiplied by (b) the quotient of 0.4123
divided by 0.7200. Except as specifically provided in the preceding sentence,
each Converted Company Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms
and conditions as were applicable to that Company Option immediately prior to
the First Viper Effective Time (including any provisions regarding the
acceleration of vesting in the event of a change in control) and shall provide
for accelerated vesting on an Involuntary Termination occurring on or prior to
December 31, 2014.



For purposes of this Section 2.5, an "Involuntary Termination" shall mean a
termination of a participant\'s employment (1) by UK Holdco or one of its
Subsidiaries without Cause (as defined in the Virgin Media Inc. 2010 Stock
Incentive Plan) or (2) by the participant following the occurrence of any of
the following events without the participant\'s consent: (x) a material breach
by UK Holdco or one of its Subsidiaries of any of the covenants in the
employment agreement between the participant and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as amended from time to time (the "Employment Agreement"), (y)
any material reduction in the participant\'s base salary as set forth in the
Employment Agreement, or (z) any material and adverse change in the
participant\'s position, title or status or any change in the participant\'s
job duties, authority or responsibilities to those of lesser status; provided
that a termination by the participant under this clause (2) shall be following
the participant providing thirty (30) days\' notice of such participant\'s
intention to terminate his or her employment for a reason as set forth in (x)
through (z), where such notice shall describe the facts and circumstances in
support of such claim in reasonable detail, and the failure of UK Holdco or
one of its Subsidiaries to cure such facts and circumstances within thirty
(30) days thereafter.

(ii) With respect to each Company Option granted pursuant to the UK Employees
Subplan (each, a "Company CSOP"), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to allow each Company CSOP holder to choose to exchange his or her Company
CSOPs for new options over Series A Holdco Shares and/or Series C Holdco
Shares. Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall seek
confirmation from the United Kingdom HM Revenue and Customs ("HMRC") that each
Company CSOP holder may exchange his or her Company CSOPs as contemplated
under clause 12(x) of the rules of the UK Employees Subplan and shall seek to
agree the basis of the exchange with HMRC based on the formula described in
Section 2.5(a)(i) of this Agreement. As soon as practicable following the
receipt of HMRC determination as to whether Company CSOP awards can be
exchanged as set forth above, the Company shall provide to each Company CSOP
holder a notice informing the holder of his or her right to exercise the
Company CSOPs in full (whether or not the Company CSOP was then fully vested)
and whether or not the participant can exchange his or her Company CSOP awards
for new options over Series A Holdco Shares and/or Series C Holdco Shares. The
Company CSOP holder shall be provided with fourteen (14) days from the receipt
of such notice to inform the Company of his or her intent to exercise or
exchange their Company CSOPs as described above, it being understood that any
acceleration and exercise of the Company CSOPs is contingent on and shall be
effective immediately prior to the First Viper Effective Time. The Company
agrees that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to make and agree with
HMRC any amendments to the rules of the UK Employees Subplan as are necessary
to implement the exchange of options or exercise of Company CSOPs as envisaged
above.

(iii) With respect to a holder of Company Options who is subject to Section
409A of the Code, in the event that the conversion set forth in Section
2.5(a)(i) does not comply with Section 409A of the Code, then the Company
shall cause the conversion and take any such other actions as deemed necessary
or desirable with respect to such holder\'s Company Options to be effected in
a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code and achieves, to the
extent reasonably possible, a substantially similar economic result as the
conversion of the Company Options set forth in Section 2.5(a)(i). 



(b) Company Stock Units. As of the First Viper Effective Time, each award of
restricted stock units or performance shares (each a "Company Stock Unit")
other than any Jointly-Owned Shares (as defined in the Virgin Media Inc. 2010
Stock Incentive Plan) (i) granted under or pursuant to any Company Incentive
Plan, other than in connection with one of the Company\'s Long-Term Incentive
Plan programs, that is outstanding immediately prior to the First Viper
Effective Time; or (ii) granted under or pursuant to any Company Incentive
Plan in connection with one of the Company\'s Long-Term Incentive Plan
programs that is outstanding, vested and non-forfeitable prior to the
Effective Time, shall be converted into an equivalent unit award (the
"Adjusted Unit Award") in respect of (A) the number of shares of the Company
Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Unit multiplied by 0.4123 to
determine the number of Series A Holdco Shares subject to such Adjusted Unit
Award and (B) the number of shares of the Company Common Stock subject to the
Company Stock Unit multiplied by 0.3077 to determine the number of Series C
Holdco Shares subject to such Adjusted Unit Award as of immediately prior to
the First Viper Effective Time (in each case of (A) and (B), rounded down to
the nearest whole share). Except as specifically provided in the preceding
sentence, each Adjusted Unit Award shall continue to be governed by the same
terms and conditions as were applicable to the Company Stock Units immediately
prior to the First Viper Effective Time and shall provide for accelerated
vesting on an Involuntary Termination occurring on or prior to December 31,
2014.

(c) LTIP Shares. As of the First Viper Effective Time, each Company Stock Unit
granted under or pursuant to one of the Company\'s Long-Term Incentive Plan
programs (other than any Jointly-Owned Shares (as defined in the Virgin Media
Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan)) that is outstanding, unvested and forfeitable
immediately prior to the First Viper Effective Time and vests under its terms
based, in whole or in part, on the achievement of certain performance
conditions (each, an "LTIP Share"), shall be treated as follows:

(i) With respect to LTIP Shares granted under the 2010-2012 Long-Term
Incentive Plan program, the number of LTIP Shares to which an individual shall
be entitled as of the First Viper Effective Time shall be determined in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the award agreement (including the
exercise of discretion by the Compensation Committee of the Company Board
pursuant to such terms in accordance with past practice) by and between the
Company and such individual evidencing the award of LTIP Shares (an "LTIP
Award Agreement") based on actual performance through December 31, 2012 and
the achievement of the applicable performance conditions, and each LTIP Share
to which the holder becomes entitled pursuant to this Section 2.5(c)(i) shall,
to the extent not settled prior to the First Viper Effective Time in
accordance with its terms, be cancelled as of the First Viper Effective Time
and converted into the right to receive (payable in accordance with Section
2.5(i) and less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment) (A) the excess of the Cash Consideration over any applicable
acquisition price per share of the LTIP Share; and (B) the Company Stock
Consideration; provided, however, that any LTIP Shares to which the holder of
an applicable LTIP Award Agreement does not become entitled pursuant to this
Section 2.5(c)(i) shall be cancelled as of the First Viper Effective Time
without consideration in exchange therefor.

(ii) With respect to the LTIP Shares granted under the 2011-2013 Long-Term
Incentive Plan program and the 2012-2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan program, the







LTIP Shares shall be assumed by UK Holdco or one of its Subsidiaries and such
award shall be adjusted (each, an "Adjusted LTIP Award") such that the number
of shares that could have been awarded if all of the performance conditions
had been fully achieved at the end of the original performance period under an
applicable LTIP Award Agreement shall be converted into an equivalent award in
respect of the number of Series A and Series C Holdco Shares, respectively,
that is determined in the same manner as Section 2.5(b) and such Adjusted LTIP
Award shall vest in full on March 1, 2014 for the 2011-2013 LTIP Shares and on
March 1, 2015 for the 2012-2014 LTIP Shares, if the Adjusted LTIP Award holder
has been continuously employed by UK Holdco or one of its Subsidiaries until
such date, as applicable. Except as specifically provided in the preceding
sentence, each Adjusted LTIP Award shall continue to be governed by the same
terms and conditions as were applicable to the LTIP Shares immediately prior
to the First Viper Effective Time under the relevant LTIP Award Agreement,
including as to the timing of settlement; provided, however, that the vesting
of the LTIP Shares shall accelerate on an Involuntary Termination occurring on
or prior to December 31, 2014. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 2.5(c)(ii), with respect to LTIP Shares granted as part of the
2012-2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan program as part of the VMB overlay plan,
the number of shares subject to assumption and adjustment as set forth above
shall be nil, being that number of shares that were expected to vest in due
course under the terms of the applicable Award Agreement based on actual and
forecast performance for the performance period as at December 31, 2012; and

(iii) With respect to LTIP Shares granted under the 2013-2015 Long-Term
Incentive Plan program, (A) to the extent such LTIP Shares are subject to
time-based vesting only, the LTIP Shares shall be converted into an equivalent
award in respect of the number of Series A Holdco Shares and Series C Holdco
Shares, respectively, that is determined in the same manner as Section 2.5(b)
and otherwise subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
the LTIP Shares immediately prior to the First Viper Effective Time; provided,
however, that the vesting of the LTIP Shares shall accelerate on an
Involuntary Termination occurring on or prior to December 31, 2014, and (B) to
the extent any portion of such LTIP Shares are subject to performance-based
vesting, the applicable awards shall be cancelled and each holder shall
receive an award under a new plan to be established after the Effective Time
that is modeled on Parent\'s performance compensation programs in respect of
at least an equivalent number of Series A Holdco Shares and Series C Holdco
Shares, respectively (determined in the same manner as Section 2.5(b)). Such
new plan will provide for performance metrics that would reasonably be
expected to result in comparable compensation for comparable performance
results as applied pursuant to the 2013-2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan program
and shall provide for accelerated vesting on an Involuntary Termination
occurring on or prior to December 31, 2014. The Company shall take all
necessary action to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.5(c)(iii)(B),
including, if considered necessary under the terms of the relevant Award
Agreements, obtaining any necessary participant consents.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the extent that the Company
has entered into a compromise or settlement agreement with an employee of the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries prior to the First Viper Effective Time
regarding such employee\'s termination of employment, (A) the terms of this
Section 2.5 regarding vesting of outstanding awards are not intended to nor
shall they cause the vesting of any Company Option, Company CSOP, Company
Stock Unit, LTIP Shares, awards under the JSOP or the acceleration of other
awards that would







not have otherwise done so under the terms of that compromise or settlement
agreement; and (B) any provisions of Sections 2.5(a), (b) or (c) regarding
treatment upon an Involuntary Termination shall not apply to any such
outstanding Company Option, Company CSOP, Company Stock Unit, LTIP Shares,
awards under the JSOP or other awards.

(e) Company JSOP. With respect to the Virgin Media Inc. Joint Share Ownership
Plan ("JSOP"), a subplan of the Virgin Media Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan,
following the date of this Agreement and prior to the First Viper Effective
Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions it
deems necessary or desirable to provide that each award under the JSOP
(including each jointly held Interest and Supplementary Award, as such terms
are defined in the JSOP) shall be treated in the First Viper Merger in a
manner that, to the extent reasonably possible, is substantially similar to
the treatment of 2011-2013 LTIP Shares pursuant to Section 2.5(c)(ii). To the
extent that such treatment is not possible, each award under the JSOP will be
treated in such other manner as determined by the Compensation Committee of
the Company Board to be appropriate and equitable to the holders of an award
under the JSOP (having first sought the prior written consent of the Parent);
provided, however, that such other treatment does not materially increase the
cost to Parent, UK Holdco or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(f) Company Sharesave Plan. The parties agree, in relation to each option
granted under the Virgin Media Sharesave Plan ("Sharesave") (each, a
"Sharesave Option"), that:

(i) they shall use their reasonable best efforts to agree with HMRC that the
Mergers are an equivalent transaction to a scheme of arrangement for the
purposes of clauses 7.3 and 8.1.3 of the Sharesave rules so that it is
possible for Sharesave Option holders to exercise their Sharesave Options
and/or exchange their Sharesave Options for a new option (or options) over
Series A Holdco Shares and/or Series C Holdco Shares;

(ii) if HMRC agrees that the Mergers are an equivalent transaction as set out
in Section 2.5(f)(i) above, they shall use their reasonable best efforts to
allow Sharesave Option holders to: (A) exchange their Sharesave Options for a
new option (or options) over Series A Holdco Shares and/or Series C Holdco
Shares as provided in clause 8 of the Sharesave rules and the Company shall
seek to agree the basis of the exchange with HMRC by reference to the exchange
ratio described in Section 2.5(a)(i) of this Agreement or on such other basis
as may be required by HMRC; or (B) exercise their Sharesave Option to the
extent the Sharesave Option can be exercised using an amount equal to the
savings accrued (including any interest) at the date of exercise so that such
exercise is contingent on and shall be effective immediately before the First
Viper Effective Time;

(iii) if HMRC does not agree that Sharesave Option holders can exchange their
Sharesave Options as described in Section 2.5(f)(ii)(A), but does agree that
Sharesave Option holders can exercise their Sharesave Options, the parties
shall use their reasonable best efforts to allow Sharesave Option holders to
exercise their Sharesave Options as described in Section 2.5(f)(ii)(B) and
shall make a payment to any Sharesave Option holder who so exercises his
Sharesave Option as follows: (A) pay to any such Sharesave Option holder who
was granted an option in 2010 (or any Sharesave Option holder who was granted
a Sharesave 

Option in 2009 which has not reached maturity as of the First Viper Effective
Time) ("2010 Sharesave Options"): (1) a cash amount equal to the lower of: the
gain the 2010 Sharesave Option holder would have made on the additional number
of shares of Company Common Stock over which he would have been able to
exercise his 2010 Sharesave Option had he been able to continue saving to
maturity before exercising his 2010 Sharesave Option and the gain a 2010
Sharesave Option holder would have made on the additional number of shares of
Company Common Stock over which he would have been able to exercise his 2010
Sharesave Option if he had been able to continue saving for a further six (6)
months and (2) a cash amount equal to the basic rate income tax that the 2010
Sharesave Option holder would be liable to pay on the gain he makes on
exercise of his 2010 Sharesave Option and (B) pay to Sharesave Option holders
who were granted options in 2011 ("2011 Sharesave Options") a cash amount
equal to the gain the 2011 Sharesave Option holder would have made on the
additional number of shares of Company Common Stock over which he would have
been able to exercise his 2011 Sharesave Option if he had been able to
continue saving for a further six (6) months and (C) pay to Sharesave Option
holders who were granted options in 2013 ("2013 Sharesave Options") a cash
amount equal to the gain the 2013 Sharesave Option holders would have made on
the additional number of shares of Company Common Stock over which he would
have been able to exercise his 2013 Sharesave Option if he had been able to
continue saving for a further three (3) months. Any cash payments made under
this Section 2.5(f)(iii) shall be grossed up for income tax and employee\'s
National Insurance contributions which shall be payable through United Kingdom
Pay As You Earn. For the purposes of this Section 2.5(f)(iii), "gain" means
the excess of the value of the shares of Common Company Stock at the date of
exercise over the aggregate exercise price paid for the shares of Common
Company Stock; and

(iv) If HMRC does not agree that the Mergers are an equivalent transaction to
a scheme of arrangement for the purposes of clause 7.3 and 8.1.3 of the
Sharesave rules, the parties will use their reasonable best efforts to make an
offer to Sharesave Option holders to cancel their Sharesave Options in
exchange for a cash payment in an amount equal to the gain Sharesave Option
holders would have made if they had been able to exercise their Sharesave
Options using an amount equal to the savings accrued (including any interest)
at the First Viper Effective Time. The cash payment shall be subject to income
tax and employee\'s National Insurance contributions which shall be payable
through United Kingdom Pay As You Earn.

In addition, a cash payment shall be made to 2010 Sharesave Option holders,
2011 Sharesave Option holders and 2013 Sharesave Option holders equal to the
amounts described in Section 2.5(f)(iii)(A)(1) (but excluding Section
2.5(f)(iii)(A)(2)), Section 2.5(f)(iii)(B) and Section 2.5(f)(iii)(C)
respectively, which cash payment shall be grossed up for income tax and
employee\'s National Insurance contributions and which shall be payable
through United Kingdom Pay As You Earn. Except as expressly provided in this
Section 2.5(f), no other cash payments shall be paid to Sharesave Option
holders.

(g) Partnership Plan (Share Incentive Plan). The parties acknowledge that
participants in the HMRC-approved Virgin Media Inc. Partnership Plan (the
"Partnership Plan") shall participate in the First Viper Merger in the same
way as a holder of shares of Company Common Stock. No further contributions
can be made under the Partnership Plan after the First Viper Effective Time
and the Company shall take all necessary action to effect the foregoing,







including providing notice to affected participants, and to ensure all
contributions to the Partnership Plan cease as of the First Viper Effective
Time. If participants can continue to benefit from income tax relief under
Chapter 6 of Part 7 of the United Kingdom Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions)
Act 2003 by continuing to hold their Company Stock Consideration in the
Partnership Plan, UK Holdco agrees to maintain the Partnership Plan until all
participants have had the opportunity to benefit from income tax relief. UK
Holdco shall, or shall cause the Viper Surviving Corporation to, serve a
Partnership Plan termination notice under paragraph 89 of Schedule 2 of the
United Kingdom Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 as soon as
reasonably practicable after all participants in the Partnership Plan have had
the opportunity to benefit from income tax relief.

(h) Virgin Mobile Holdings (UK) PLC Share Incentive Plan. If, prior to the
date of this Agreement, a plan termination notice for the Virgin Mobile
Holdings (UK) PLC Share Incentive Plan (the "Mobile SIP") has not been served
as required by paragraph 89 of Schedule 2 of the United Kingdom Income Tax
(Earnings and Pension) Act 2003, the board of Virgin Mobile Holdings (UK)
Limited shall as soon as practicable thereafter give such plan termination
notice and undertake all necessary actions to terminate the Mobile SIP.

(i) Payment and Withholding. Each of the Company, Parent, UK Holdco, the Viper
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable,
is entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable under this
Section 2.5, all amounts as are required to be deducted, withheld or accounted
for with respect to (i) the making of any payment, (ii) the issue of any stock
or (iii) any other actions taken under this Section 2.5 including any
amendment or variation to any of the options, shares, units, awards or other
rights thereunder, in each case, under the Code, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any other provision of U.S. federal, state, local
or foreign Tax Laws including under the United Kingdom Pay As You Earn rules
in respect of income tax and primary National Insurance contributions. Any
such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Company, Parent, UK Holdco,
the Viper Surviving Corporation, or one of their respective Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction, withholding or payment or account was made.

(j) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares shall be issued upon settlement or
conversion of any of the foregoing awards. The number of shares of the
applicable series of Holdco Shares issuable with respect to any award shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole share and the exercise price per option
shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent, as applicable.

(k) Further Actions. Prior to the First Viper Effective Time, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall pass such resolutions and take such other actions, as
may be necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 2.5. Parent shall or
shall cause UK Holdco to undertake all corporate action necessary to reserve
for issuance a sufficient number of Series A Holdco Shares and Series C Holdco
Shares for delivery upon exercise or settlement of the Converted Company
Options, Company CSOPs, Adjusted Unit Awards, Adjusted LTIP Awards, awards
under the JSOP, and Sharesave Options under Section 2.5, as applicable.
Promptly after the First Viper Effective Time, UK Holdco shall file with the
SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any







successor or other appropriate forms) or shall file an amendment to an
existing registration statement, as necessary, with respect to the Series A
Holdco Shares and Series C Holdco Shares subject to the Converted Company
Options, Company CSOPs, Adjusted Unit Awards, Adjusted LTIP Awards, awards
under the JSOP, and Sharesave Options and shall use reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long as such
Converted Company Options, Company CSOPs, Adjusted Unit Awards, Adjusted LTIP
Awards, awards under the JSOP, and Sharesave Options, as applicable, remain
outstanding.

Section 2.6 Treatment of Parent Equity-Based Awards.

(a) Parent Stock Awards. As of the First Lynx Effective Time, each award of
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units,
performance shares or other equity-based compensation award (each a "Parent
Stock Award") granted under or pursuant to any Parent Incentive Plan, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the First Lynx
Effective Time shall be converted into an equivalent award (the "Parent
Adjusted Stock Award") of the same type, with the same exercise price, if any,
and in respect of the same number of Series A Holdco Shares and Series C
Holdco Shares, respectively, as applied to the number of shares of Series A
Parent Common Stock and Series C Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent
Adjusted Stock Award as of immediately prior to the First Lynx Effective Time.
Except as specifically provided in the preceding sentence, each Parent
Adjusted Stock Award shall continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the Parent Stock Award immediately prior to
the First Lynx Effective Time.

(b) Further Actions. Prior to the First Lynx Effective Time, the Parent and
its Subsidiaries shall pass such resolutions and take such other actions, as
may be necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 2.6. Parent shall or
shall cause UK Holdco to undertake all corporate action necessary to reserve
for issuance a sufficient number of Series A Holdco Shares and Series C Holdco
Shares for delivery upon exercise or settlement of the Parent Adjusted Stock
Awards. Promptly after the First Lynx Effective Time, UK Holdco shall file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate forms) or shall file an amendment to an existing registration
statement, as necessary, with respect to the Series A Holdco Shares and Series
C Holdco Shares subject to the Parent Adjusted Stock Awards and shall use
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus contained
therein) for so long as such awards remain outstanding.

Section 2.7 Exchange Agent, Depositary and Clearance System Arrangements.

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, UK Holdco, Parent and the
Company shall appoint a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent for the
payment of the Company Merger Consideration and the Parent Merger
Consideration (the "Exchange Agent").

(b) Depositary and Clearance Systems. UK Holdco, Parent, the Company and any
of their respective Subsidiaries may prior to the earlier of the First Viper
Effective Time and the First Lynx Effective Time enter into any arrangements
with the Exchange Agent and/or any other financial institution mutually agreed
as acceptable by Parent and the Company as may be 

necessary to implement a custodian arrangement in respect of the Holdco Shares
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.2, and/or to create depositary
shares and depositary receipts in respect of such Holdco Shares, and/or to
place any such Holdco Shares into an approved clearance system or any
combination of these. In this Agreement, any reference to "Holdco Shares" or
book-entry shares shall be treated as including, where the context requires,
any depositary share, depositary receipt, or interest in any custodian or
clearance system which represents any Holdco Shares. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties agree that UK Holdco may deliver such depositary shares,
depositary receipts or book-entry or other interests in respect of Holdco
Shares as Company Merger Consideration and Parent Merger Consideration so long
as former holders of Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock are treated
equally in respect of any such arrangement.

Section 2.8 Exchange and Payment.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent and/or UK Holdco shall deposit (or causing to
be deposited) with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of
shares of Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock, book-entry shares
representing the Holdco Shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section
2.2, as applicable, and an amount of cash representing the aggregate Cash
Consideration payable to holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
Section 2.1. In addition, Parent and/or UK Holdco shall make available by
depositing (or causing to be deposited) with the Exchange Agent, as necessary
from time to time after the earlier of the First Viper Effective Time and the
First Lynx Effective Time, any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.8(e) and any cash in lieu of fractional Series A Holdco Shares and
Series C Holdco Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.8(g). All book-entry
Holdco Shares, dividends, distributions and cash deposited with the Exchange
Agent are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the earlier of the First Viper
Effective Time and the First Lynx Effective Time, UK Holdco shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to (i) each holder of record of a certificate ("Company
Certificates") or a book-entry share ("Company Book-Entry Shares") that
immediately prior to the First Viper Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock that were converted into the right to receive
the Company Merger Consideration, any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.8(e) and any cash in lieu of fractional Series A Holdco
Shares and Series C Holdco Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.8(g) and (ii)
each holder of record of a certificate ("Parent Certificates" and together
with Company Certificates, "Certificates") or a book-entry share ("Parent
Book-Entry Shares" and together with Company Book-Entry Shares, "Book-Entry
Shares") that immediately prior to the First Lynx Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock that were converted into the right
to receive the applicable Parent Merger Consideration and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.8(e);

(i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such
Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent, or in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and which letter shall be
in customary form and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (prior to the
First Viper









Effective Time) and contain such other provisions as Parent or the Exchange
Agent may reasonably specify); and

(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Company
Certificates, Company Book-Entry Shares, Parent Certificates or Parent Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for (A) the Company Merger Consideration or the
applicable Parent Merger Consideration, as the case may be, (B) any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.8(e) and (C) any cash in
lieu of fractional Series A Holdco Shares and Series C Holdco Shares payable
pursuant to Section 2.8(g).

(c) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into a right to receive the Company Merger Consideration, upon surrender of a
Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably require, shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) the issue of the number of Series A Holdco Shares and
Series C Holdco Shares (after taking into account all shares of Company Common
Stock attributable to such holder under all Company Certificates or Company
Book-Entry Shares so surrendered) to which such holder of Company Common Stock
shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1(b), (ii)
the cash consideration to which such holder of Company Common Stock shall be
entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1(b), (iii) any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.8(e) and (iv) any cash in
lieu of fractional Series A Holdco Shares and Series C Holdco Shares payable
pursuant to Section 2.8(g), and the Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Each holder of shares of
Parent Common Stock that have been converted into a right to receive the
applicable Parent Merger Consideration, upon surrender of a Parent Certificate
or Parent Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) the
number of Series A Holdco Shares, Series B Holdco Shares or Series C Holdco
Shares, as applicable (after taking into account all shares of Parent Common
Stock attributable to such holder under all Parent Certificates or Parent
Book-Entry Shares so surrendered), to which such holder of Parent Common Stock
shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2(b), and
(B) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.8(e),
and the Parent Certificates or Parent Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any unpaid
dividends and distributions or cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any,
payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.8, each Company Certificate or Company Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed after the First Viper Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the Company Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.8(e) and any cash in lieu of fractional Series A Holdco Shares and Series C
Holdco Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.8(g), but shall not entitle its
holder or any other Person to any rights as a stockholder of the Company or UK
Holdco. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.8, each Parent
Certificate or Parent Book-Entry Share shall be deemed after the First Lynx
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Parent
Merger Consideration payable in respect









thereof and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.8(e), but shall not entitle its holder or any other Person to any rights as
a stockholder of UK Holdco or Parent.

(d) If payment of the Company Merger Consideration or the applicable Parent
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that such Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer or such
Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Company Merger Consideration or the applicable Parent
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share or shall have established to the satisfaction
of UK Holdco that such Tax is not applicable.

(e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to any Holdco Share with
a record date after the First Viper Effective Time or First Lynx Effective
Time, as applicable, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the Holdco Shares that the
holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender thereof in
accordance with Section 2.1 and Section 2.2, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional Series A Holdco Shares and Series C Holdco Shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to Section 2.8(g), in each case until the holder
thereof shall surrender such Book-Entry Share or Certificate in accordance
with this Article II. Following the surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in accordance with this Article II, there shall be paid to the record
holder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the
amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
First Viper Effective Time or the First Lynx Effect Time, as applicable,
theretofore paid with respect to such Holdco Shares and the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional Series A Holdco Shares and Series C Holdco
Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.8(g) and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the First Viper Effective Time or the First Lynx
Effective Time, as applicable, but prior to such surrender payable with
respect to such Holdco Shares.

(f) The Company Merger Consideration or the Parent Merger Consideration, as
applicable, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.8(e) and any cash in lieu of fractional Series A Holdco Shares and Series C
Holdco Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.8(g) issued and paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry
Shares or Parent Common Stock formerly represented by such Parent Certificates
or Parent Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. At the First Viper Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the First Viper Effective Time. At the
First Lynx Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Parent shall be closed
and there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares of
Parent Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the First Lynx
Effective Time. If, after the First Viper Effective Time or the First Lynx
Effective Time, as applicable, Certificates are presented to UK Holdco, the
Viper Surviving Corporation, the Lynx Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for transfer, or





transfer is sought for Company Book-Entry Shares or Parent Book-Entry Shares,
such corresponding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the
case of Dissenting Shares.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
representing fractional Series A Holdco Shares or Series C Holdco Shares shall
be issued upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no
dividends or other distributions with respect to the Series A Holdco Shares
and Series C Holdco Shares shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of UK Holdco. In
lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, UK Holdco shall pay to each
former stockholder of the Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive a
fractional Series A Holdco Share or Series C Holdco Share an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to the sum of (i) product of (A) the fraction of the
Series A Holdco Share that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
(taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the First
Viper Effective Time by such holder and rounded to the nearest thousandth when
expressed in decimal form) pursuant to Section 2.1(b) multiplied by (B) the
twenty (20)-day aggregate volume weighted-average per share price, rounded to
two (2) decimal points, of shares of Series A Parent Common Stock on the
Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq") (as reported on Bloomberg Financial
Markets or such other source as the parties shall agree in writing) for the
period of the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on the last full
trading day occurring prior to the date of the First Viper Effective Time plus
(ii) the product of (A) the fraction of a Series C Holdco Share that such
holder would otherwise be entitled to receive (taking into account all shares
of Company Common Stock held at the First Viper Effective Time by such holder
and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) pursuant
to Section 2.1(b) multiplied by (B) the twenty (20)-day aggregate volume
weighted-average per share price, rounded to two (2) decimal points, of shares
of Series C Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq (as reported on Bloomberg Financial
Markets or such other source as the parties shall agree in writing) for the
period of the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on the last full
trading day occurring prior to the date of the First Viper Effective Time.

(h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including cash consideration and any
interest or other income earned on the Exchange Fund) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares two (2)
years after the later of the First Viper Effective Time and the First Lynx
Effective Time shall be delivered to either of the Surviving Corporations,
upon demand, and any remaining holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporations and UK Holdco, as
general creditors thereof, for payment of the Company Merger Consideration or
Parent Merger Consideration, any unpaid dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.8(e) and any cash in lieu of fractional Series A
Holdco Shares and Series C Holdco Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.8(g).

(i) None of UK Holdco, the Surviving Corporations, the Exchange Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any of the Holdco
Shares, cash consideration, dividends or other distributions with respect
thereto or cash in lieu of fractional Series A Holdco Shares and Series C
Holdco Shares properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 



(j) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund,
including the aggregate Cash Consideration, pending its disbursement to such
holders, in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America
or (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the
United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal
and interest. UK Holdco shall be responsible for any losses in the Exchange
Fund and shall deposit additional cash with the Exchange Agent as may be
required from time to time in order for the Exchange Agent to make the
payments required by this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to UK Holdco.

(k) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to UK
Holdco, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by UK Holdco or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such customary amount as UK Holdco or the
Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it or the applicable Surviving Corporations
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Parent Merger
Consideration or Company Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.8(e) and any
cash in lieu of fractional Series A Holdco Shares and Series C Holdco Shares
payable pursuant to Section 2.8(g).

Section 2.9 Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporations, UK Holdco
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the
Surviving Corporations, UK Holdco or the Exchange Agent determine it is
required to deduct and withhold under the Code, applicable Treasury
Regulations or any provision of state, local or foreign Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

Section 2.10 Adjustments. If between the date of this Agreement and the First
Viper Effective Time the outstanding Holdco Shares or shares of Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number
of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend or any
subdivision, reclassification, split, combination, consolidation or exchange
of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number or amount
contained herein (including any exchange ratio) which is based upon the number
of Series A Holdco Shares, Series B Holdco Shares, Series C Holdco Shares, or
shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be,
will be appropriately adjusted to provide to UK Holdco and the holders of
Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock and holders of outstanding
Company Options, Company CSOPs, Sharesave Options, Company Stock Units, LTIP
Shares and awards under the JSOP, the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 2.10 shall be construed to permit UK Holdco, Parent or the Company to
take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms
of this Agreement. 



Section 2.11 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the First Viper Effective Time that are held by any
holder that shall not have voted in favor of the First Viper Merger and shall
have properly demanded appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and shall have not properly revoked such
demand) prior to the First Viper Effective Time (such shares, "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Company Merger
Consideration, unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holder\'s right to appraisal
under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any
such right to appraisal, each such share of Company Common Stock of such
holder shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the
right to receive, as of the later of the First Viper Effective Time and the
time that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or
expired, the Company Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II.
The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent and UK Holdco of any demands
for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of
such notices or demands and any other instruments received by the Company
relating to rights to appraisal, and Parent and UK Holdco shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of UK Holdco
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), make any payment with respect
to, settle or offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto), (ii) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto and (iii) present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and their respective consolidated results of operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments that were not,
or are not expected to be, material in amount).

(d) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed in the Company\'s periodic and current reports under
the Exchange Act and under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules issued by the
UK Financial Services Authority, is made known to the Company\'s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, by others within those entities, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures as required under the
Exchange Act or under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules issued by the UK
Financial Services Authority. The Company\'s management has evaluated, with
the participation of the Company\'s principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, the effectiveness
of the Company\'s disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company SEC Document
that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, their
conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation.

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a system of
"internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) regarding the reliability of the Company\'s
financial reporting and the preparation of the Company\'s financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP which is sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, consistently
applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in accordance with the
authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection
of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the properties or
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation of the Company\'s internal control over
financial reporting prior to the date hereof, to the Company\'s auditors and
audit committee (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of the Company\'s internal control over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely 

affect the Company\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company\'s internal control over financial reporting.

(f) Since January 1, 2010, (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,
auditor or accountant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the Company\'s financial statements or accounting or auditing
practices of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
improper accounting or auditing practices and (ii) no attorney representing
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of
securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or agents to the Company Board or any committee thereof or to any
director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(g) As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
any comment letters received from the staff of the SEC or the UK Financial
Services Authority (as the case may be) with respect to the Company SEC
Documents or the Company FSA Documents. To the knowledge of the Company, as of
the date hereof none of the Company SEC Documents or the Company FSA Documents
is subject to ongoing review or outstanding comment or investigation by the
SEC or the UK Financial Services Authority.

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or
intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Company\'s or such Subsidiary\'s published financial
statements or other Company SEC Documents.

(i) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable

reflected on a balance sheet under GAAP, except (a) to the extent accrued or
reserved against in the Company Financial Statements, (b) obligations incurred
in the ordinary course of business which do not result from a breach of
Contract or violation of Law by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (c)

be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as

consistent with past practice, (b) none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any action (or omitted to take any action) that, if
taken (or omitted to be taken) after the date hereof without the consent of
Parent, would have constituted a breach of any of the covenants set forth in
clauses (i), (iii), (iv), (v), (vii), (xii), (xiii) or (xviii) of Section
5.1(a), and (c) there have not been any adverse changes, events or

Section 3.10 Litigation. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, there is no action, suit, claim, arbitration, investigation, inquiry,

of the Company, threatened in writing against or affecting the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of their
respective properties or assets, or any present or former officer, director or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in such individual\'s
capacity as such. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective material properties or material assets is subject to any
outstanding judgments, orders, injunctions, rulings or decrees of any
Governmental Entity other than any judgment, order, injunction, ruling or
decree that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not

since January 1, 2011, a notice or other written communication from any
Governmental Entity or other Person alleging or relating to a possible
material violation of any Law applicable to their businesses, operations,

conduct of its business as such business is currently being conducted (the
"Company Permits"), except where the failure to have any of the Company
Permits has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of
the Company, all Company Permits are valid and in full force and effect,
except where the failure to be in full force and effect has not had and would

parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code or any similar
provision of applicable Law).

(h) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the

heretofore made available to the Company (or made publicly available on the
SEC website), true and complete copies of all forms, reports, schedules,
statements and other documents required to be filed with or furnished to the
SEC by Parent since January 1, 2010 (all such documents, together with all
exhibits and schedules to the foregoing materials and all information
incorporated therein by reference, the "Parent SEC Documents"). Telenet Group
Holding NV ("Telenet") has filed or furnished any material form, report,
statement, schedule or other document required to be filed with any stock
exchange, self regulatory organization, or Governmental Entity that oversees
public reporting obligations applicable to Telenet\'s publicly traded

(or made publicly available on Telenet\'s website), true and complete copies
of all such forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents required
to be filed with or furnished to such stock exchange, self regulatory
organization, or Governmental Entity by Telenet since January 1, 2010 (all
such documents, together, with all exhibits and schedules thereto to the
foregoing materials and all information incorporated therein, the "Telenet
Documents"). As of their respective filing or furnished dates (or, if amended
or superseded by a filing or a document furnished prior to the date of this
Agreement, then on such filing or furnished date), the Parent SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, including, in each
case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Telenet
Documents complied in all material respects with all Laws applicable thereto
and none of the Parent SEC Documents or the Telenet Documents contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act,
including, in each case, the rules and regulations thereunder. No Subsidiary
of Parent is required to register its securities pursuant to the Exchange Act
or is subject to the reporting requirements thereunder. 

(b) The financial statements (including the related notes and schedules
thereto) included (or incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC Documents
(the "Parent Financial Statements") (i) have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q,
Form 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto), (ii) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto and (iii) present fairly in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and their respective consolidated results of operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to

expected to be, material in amount).

(c) Parent has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information
relating to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed in Parent\'s periodic and current reports under the Exchange Act, is
made known to Parent\'s management, including its principal executive and
principal financial officers, or others performing similar functions, by
others within those entities, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures as required under the Exchange Act. Parent\'s
management has evaluated, with the participation of Parent\'s principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, the effectiveness of Parent\'s disclosure controls and procedures
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable
Parent SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any
amendment thereto, their conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or
amendment based on such evaluation.

(d) Parent and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a system of
"internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) regarding the reliability of Parent\'s
financial reporting and the preparation of Parent\'s financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP which is sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, consistently
applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in accordance with the
authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection
of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the properties or
assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries. Parent has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting prior
to the date hereof, to Parent\'s auditors and audit committee (A) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect Parent\'s ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting.

(e) Since January 1, 2010, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, auditor or accountant
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has received any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written 

or oral, regarding the Parent\'s or Telenet\'s financial statements or
accounting or auditing practices of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in improper accounting or auditing practices and (ii) no attorney
representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by

directors, employees or agents to the Parent Board or any committee thereof or
to any director or officer of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

Parent SEC Documents is subject to ongoing review or outstanding SEC comment
or investigation.

(g) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or intended
effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
Parent\'s or such Subsidiary\'s published financial statements or other Parent
SEC Documents.

(h) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of Nasdaq.

reflected on a balance sheet under GAAP, except (a) to the extent accrued or
reserved against in the Parent Financial Statements, (b) obligations incurred
in the ordinary course of business which do not result from a breach of

their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice, (b) none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
has taken any action (or omitted to take any action) that, if taken (or

Subsidiaries in such individual\'s capacity as such. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective material properties or material
assets is subject to any outstanding judgments, orders, injunctions, rulings

Section 4.26 Financing.

(a) Parent has provided the Company with true and complete copies of the fully
executed commitment letters or other financing agreements (the "Definitive
Financing Agreements"), dated as of the date hereof, by and among the parties
named therein (collectively, and together with the exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments thereto in effect as of the date hereof, the "Financing
Commitments" and the initial purchasers and lenders party thereto, the
"Financing Parties"), pursuant to which such Financing Parties have agreed,
subject to and on the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend or
otherwise provide the principal amounts of indebtedness set forth therein (the
"Debt Financing") to the parties specified therein to (A) finance a portion of
the payment of the Cash Consideration, (B) refinance (the "Proposed
Refinancing") the indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries listed on
Section 4.26(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter (the "Scheduled
Indebtedness"), and (C) finance the payment of fees, expenses, accrued
interest and premiums, as applicable, related to the provision of the Debt
Financing or the refinancing of the Scheduled Indebtedness. Other than the
Definitive Financing Agreements, there are no side letters or other
agreements, contracts or arrangements relating to 

the Debt Financing, including any that could affect the availability of the
Debt Financing, except for agreements between Parent, UK Holdco or any of the
Merger Subs and the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, to which Parent,
UK Holdco, any of the Merger Subs or any of their Affiliates is a party.

(b) Except as expressly set forth in the Definitive Financing Agreements,
there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Financing Parties
to make the Debt Financing available to the parties specified therein on the
terms contained therein or any contingencies that would permit the Financing
Parties to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing. As of the date of
this Agreement, none of Parent, UK Holdco or any of the Merger Subs has reason
to believe that either Parent or Merger Sub will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis any term or condition of the Financing Commitments required to be
satisfied by it on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Parent, UK Holdco or
any of the Merger Subs have knowledge that any of the Financing Parties will
not perform its obligations thereunder.

(c) Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with its terms and
conditions upon the consummation of the First Viper Merger, the aggregate
proceeds of the Debt Financing, when funded in accordance with the Financing
Commitments, together with UK Holdco\'s (and its Subsidiaries\') and Parent\'s
cash on hand and other sources of immediately available funds, shall enable
(i) Parent, UK Holdco and/or one or more of the Merger Subs at the First Viper
Effective Time to (A) pay in full the aggregate Cash Consideration and (B)
effect the Proposed Refinancing and (ii) Parent, UK Holdco, the Merger Subs
and the Surviving Corporation to pay in full all fees and expenses payable by
any of them in connection with the Merger.

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments are valid and
binding obligations of Parent, UK Holdco and each of the Merger Subs and, to
the knowledge of Parent, of each of the other parties thereto and are in full
force and effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event within the direct
control of Parent, UK Holdco or any of the Merger Subs has occurred that, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach or an incurable failure to satisfy a condition
precedent on the part of Parent, UK Holdco or any of the Merger Subs under the
terms and conditions of the Financing Commitments, other than any such default
or breach that has been waived by the Financing Parties or otherwise cured in
a timely manner by Parent, UK Holdco and/or one or more of the Merger Subs. As
of the date of this Agreement, Parent, UK Holdco and the Merger Subs have paid
in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant
to the terms of the Financing Commitments on or before the date of this
Agreement. As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments have not been
modified, amended or altered since executed copies thereof were delivered to
the Company.

(e) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing) by Parent, UK
Holdco or any of the Merger Subs or any other financing or other transactions
be a condition to any of Parent\'s, UK Holdco\'s or any of the Merger Subs\'
obligations hereunder. 

(f) None of Parent, UK Holdco or any of the Merger Subs is a party to any
agreement which expressly limits or restricts the ability of any Person to
provide debt financing for other potential purchasers of the Company.

Holdco and each of the Merger Subs in this Article IV, none of Parent, UK
Holdco, any of the Merger Subs or any other Person makes any express or

For purposes of clauses (i) through (xix) above, the determination as to

significance, substantiality or materiality to a particular Subsidiary.

(b) Conduct of Business by Parent. From and after the date hereof until the
earlier of the First Lynx Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement

shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' operations prior to the First Viper
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parent\'s or

Section 5.2 No Solicitation by the Company; Recommendation of the First Viper
Merger.

(a) Except as permitted by this Section 5.2, until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII and the First
Viper Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,
accountants, attorneys or other advisors, agents or representatives
(collectively, "Representatives") to, immediately cease or cause to be

restrictions set forth in this Section 5.2(a) conducted theretofore by the
Company or its Representatives with respect to any Company Acquisition
Proposal and request the return or destruction of all confidential information
previously provided to any Person (other than Parent or any designees of
Parent) in connection therewith by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Subject to Sections 5.2(b) and 5.2(c), at all times during the
period commencing on the date of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII
and the First Viper Effective Time, the Company shall not and the Company
shall cause its Subsidiaries, and shall instruct its and their respective
Representatives, not to (and shall not authorize or permit any such
Representatives to), directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or induce
the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate
or assist, an offer or proposal for a Company Acquisition Transaction (a
"Company Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent
or any designees of Parent) any non-public information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person (other than Parent or any
designees of Parent) access to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company

discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to a Company
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend a Company Acquisition
Proposal, or (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding
or other Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to a Company Acquisition
Transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Acquisition Transaction"
means any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) involving: (A) the purchase or
other acquisition from the Company by any Person or "group" (as defined in or
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than
twenty percent (20%) of the Company Common Stock (or of any other class of
equity or voting securities of the Company outstanding as of the consummation
of such purchase or other acquisition), (B) any tender offer or exchange offer
by any Person or "group" (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act) that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such
Person or "group" beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, more than
twenty percent (20%) of the Company Common Stock (or of any other class of
equity or voting securities of the Company outstanding as of the consummation
of such tender or exchange offer); (C) a merger, consolidation, business
combination, joint venture, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other winding up or other similar transaction involving the Company pursuant

interests (or more than twenty percent (20%) of the voting equity interests
(measured on a voting basis)) in the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction; or (D) any direct or indirect sale, transfer, acquisition or
disposition of more than twenty percent (20%) of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (including 

equity interests in such Subsidiaries), taken as a whole (measured by the fair
market value thereof).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5.2 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board may, directly or indirectly through the Company\'s
Representatives, participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with,
furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, and/or afford access to the business, properties, assets,
books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Person that has made a bona fide
written Company Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited as a result of a
breach of Section 5.2(a) and that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with one or both of the Company Financial Advisors or
another Experienced Financial Advisor and with Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and
Jacobson LLP ("Fried Frank") or other Experienced Counsel) either constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, if
prior to taking such action, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with Experienced Counsel) that its failure to take such actions
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided, however, that (i) promptly, but in any event no later than the first
(1st) Business Day after it receives any Company Acquisition Proposal, the
Company gives Parent written notice of the identity of such Person and the
material terms of such Company Acquisition Proposal (and keeps Parent
reasonably promptly advised of all amendments and proposed amendments to any
material terms thereto), (ii) prior to providing any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or affording access to
the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information, or to any personnel, the Company has entered into a
confidentiality agreement with any such Person containing restrictions no less
favorable to the Company than, and otherwise substantially similar to, the
restrictions set forth in Section 5.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and
that does not prohibit compliance by the Company with the provisions of this
Section 5.2, and (iii) reasonably contemporaneously with furnishing any non-
public information to such Person, the Company furnishes such non-public
information to Parent to the extent such information has not been previously
furnished by the Company to Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company
Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal
for a Company Acquisition Transaction on terms that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with an Experienced Financial
Advisor and Experienced Counsel) would be, taking into account all reasonably
available legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such Company Acquisition
Proposal and the timing and likelihood of consummation of such Company
Acquisition Proposal, more favorable to the stockholders of the Company (in
their capacity as such), from a financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account any offers of changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or
otherwise); provided, however, that, for purposes of the definition of
"Company Superior Proposal", all references to twenty (20%) percent in the
definition of Company Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to refer to
fifty percent (50%). For the avoidance of doubt, all information provided to
Parent pursuant to this Section 5.2 will be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 5.2, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (w) withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent, the 

Company Board Recommendation (a "Company Board Recommendation Change"), or (x)
enter into (or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into) an
agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement as contemplated by Section
5.2(b)) relating to a transaction contemplated by a Company Acquisition
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, (A) if the Company Board shall have received a Company Acquisition
Proposal that was not solicited as a result of a breach of Section 5.2(a), the
Company Board may (y) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or (z)
solely with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal from an Excluded Party,
enter into an agreement providing for a transaction contemplated by such
Company Acquisition Proposal if, in each case: (i) the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with an Experienced Financial
Advisor and with Experienced Counsel) that such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; (ii) the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with Experienced Counsel) that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; (iii) the Company has provided Parent at least
five (5) Business Days\' prior written notice that it intends to take such
action (a "Section 5.2 Notice") (it being understood that the Section 5.2
Notice shall include a copy of such Company Superior Proposal (and the
information with respect to such Company Superior Proposal that is specified
in Section 5.2(b)(i) to the extent not otherwise included in such copy) and
that such Section 5.2 Notice shall not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement); (iv) if requested by
Parent, the Company, Parent and their Representatives shall have negotiated in
good faith with respect to any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement during the five (5) Business Day period following
delivery by the Company to Parent of the Section 5.2 Notice (it being
understood that in the event of any amendment to the financial or other
material terms of such Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall deliver
a new Section 5.2 Notice and shall comply with the requirements of this
Section 5.2(c) with respect to such new Section 5.2 Notice); provided,
however, the notice period and the period during which the Company and its
Representatives are required to negotiate in good faith with Parent regarding
any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall expire on the later to occur of three (3) Business Days after the
Company provides such new Section 5.2 Notice and the end of the original five
(5) Business Day period described above; (v) if Parent shall have delivered to
the Company a written, binding and irrevocable (for the remainder of the five
(5) or three (3) Business Day period, as applicable) offer capable of being
accepted by the Company to alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement
during such five (5) Business Day period or any subsequent three (3) Business
Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with an Experienced Financial Advisor and Experienced Counsel),
after considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that the Company Superior
Proposal giving rise to such Section 5.2 Notice continues to be a Company
Superior Proposal; and (vi) in the case of clause (z) above, the Company
concurrently terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(d)(iii);
provided, however, that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant
to this sentence shall be void and of no force or effect unless the Company
(or a party acting on behalf of the Company) pays Parent the applicable
termination fee in accordance with Section 7.3(b); or (B) the Company Board
may also effect a Company Board Recommendation Change if there shall have been
any material event, development, circumstance, occurrence or change in
circumstances or facts (including any material change in probability or
magnitude of circumstances) which first occurred (or of which 

the Company Board first became aware) after the date hereof, which was not
reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board, and the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with Experienced Counsel) that
the failure to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (C) on the
fifteenth (15th) trading day prior to the then-scheduled date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting (as such date may be extended or postponed) (the date of
delivery of such notice, the "Parent Stock Event Notice Date"), the Company
Board may deliver to Parent a Section 5.2 Notice to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change if there shall have been a Parent Stock Event and the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
Experienced Counsel) that the failure to effect such Company Board
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and, in either case described in clause (B) or clause (C), (1)
the Company provides Parent with a Section 5.2 Notice that it intends to take
such action (it being understood that the Section 5.2 Notice shall describe in
reasonable detail the reasons underlying the Company Board Recommendation
Change and shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for
purposes of this Agreement), (2) if requested by Parent, the Company, Parent
and their Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith with respect to
any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
during the five (5) Business Day period following delivery by the Company to
Parent of such Section 5.2 Notice, and (3) in the case of a Company Board
Recommendation Change described in Clause (B), if Parent shall have delivered
to the Company a written, binding and irrevocable (for the remainder of the
five (5) Business Day period) offer capable of being accepted by the Company
to alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement during such five (5)
Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with an Experienced Financial Advisor and Experienced
Counsel), after considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. The Company may not exercise its rights pursuant to this
Section 5.2(c) in respect of a Parent Stock Event on more than one occasion.

equity interests (measured on a voting basis)) in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction; or (D) any direct or indirect sale, transfer, 

acquisition or disposition of more than twenty percent (20%) of the assets of
Parent and its Subsidiaries (including equity interests in such Subsidiaries),
taken as a whole (measured by the fair market value thereof).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5.3 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to receipt of the Parent Stockholder
Approval, the Parent Board may, directly or indirectly through Parent\'s
Representatives, participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with,
furnish any non-public information relating to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to, and/or afford access to the business, properties, assets,
books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Person that has made a bona fide written
Parent Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited as a result of a breach of
Section 5.3(a) and that the Parent Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with one or both of the Parent Financial Advisors or another
Experienced Financial Advisor and with Shearman and Sterling LLP ("SandS") or
other Experienced Counsel) either constitutes or could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal, if prior to taking such action, the
Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation with Experienced
Counsel) that its failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that (i) promptly,
but in any event no later than the first (1st) Business Day after it receives
any Parent Acquisition Proposal, Parent gives the Company written notice of
the identity of such Person and the material terms of such Parent Acquisition
Proposal (and keeps the Company reasonably promptly advised of all amendments
and proposed amendments to any material terms thereto), (ii) prior to
providing any non-public information relating to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to, or affording access to the business, properties, assets,
books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, Parent
has entered into a confidentiality agreement with any such Person containing
restrictions no less favorable to Parent than, and otherwise substantially
similar to, the restrictions set forth in Section 5.3(b) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, and that does not prohibit compliance by Parent with the
provisions of this Section 5.3, and (iii) reasonably contemporaneously with
furnishing any non-public information to such Person, Parent furnishes such
non-public information to the Company to the extent such information has not
been previously furnished by Parent to the Company. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Parent Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Parent
Acquisition Proposal for a Parent Acquisition Transaction on terms that the
Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation with an Experienced
Financial Advisor and Experienced Counsel) would be, taking into account all
reasonably available legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such Company
Acquisition Proposal and the timing and likelihood of consummation of such
Parent Acquisition Proposal, more favorable to the stockholders of Parent (in
their capacity as such), from a financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account any offers of changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Company in response to such offer
or otherwise); provided, however, that, for purposes of the definition of
"Parent Superior Proposal", all references to twenty (20%) percent in the
definition of Parent Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to refer to fifty
percent (50%). For the avoidance of doubt, all information provided to the
Company pursuant to this Section 5.3 will be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 5.3, neither the Parent Board nor any
committee thereof shall (w) withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner
adverse to the Company, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or
modify in a manner adverse to 

the Company, the Parent Board Recommendation (a "Parent Board Recommendation
Change"), or (x) enter into (or allow Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into) an agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement as
contemplated by Section 5.3(b)) relating to a transaction contemplated by a
Parent Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to receipt of the
Parent Stockholder Approval, (A) if the Parent Board shall have received a
Parent Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited as a result of a breach of
Section 5.3(a), the Parent Board may (y) effect a Parent Board Recommendation
Change or (z) enter into an agreement providing for a transaction contemplated
by such Parent Acquisition Proposal if, in each case: (i) the Parent Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with an Experienced Financial
Advisor and with Experienced Counsel) that such Parent Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal; (ii) the Parent Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with Experienced Counsel) that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; (iii) Parent has provided the Company at least
five (5) Business Days\' prior written notice that it intends to take such
action (a "Section 5.3 Notice") (it being understood that the Section 5.3
Notice shall not constitute a Parent Board Recommendation Change for purposes
of this Agreement); and (iv) in the case of clause (z) above, Parent
concurrently terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(c)(iv);
provided, however, that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant
to this sentence shall be void and of no force or effect unless Parent (or a
party acting on behalf of Parent) pays the Company the applicable termination
fee in accordance with Section 7.3(c); or (B) the Parent Board may also effect
a Parent Board Recommendation Change if (1) there shall have been any material
event, development, circumstance, occurrence or change in circumstances or
facts (including any material change in probability or magnitude of
circumstances) which first occurred (or of which the Parent Board first became
aware) after the date hereof, which was not reasonably foreseeable by the
Parent Board, and the Parent Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with Experienced Counsel) that the failure to effect such Parent
Board Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; and (2) Parent has provided the Company with at least
five (5) Business Days prior written notice that it intends to take such
action (it being understood that such notice shall describe in reasonable
detail the reasons underlying the Parent Board Recommendation Change and shall
not constitute a Parent Board Recommendation Change for purposes of this
Agreement).

(d) In the event there is any Parent Board Recommendation Change pursuant to
this Section 5.3, and the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held
less than ten (10) Business Days following such event, then Parent and the
Parent Board shall be entitled to postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting to
such tenth (10th) Business Day (or such later date as may be required by
applicable Law or the SEC) and if the Outside Date would otherwise occur
before the third (3rd) Business Day following the Parent Stockholders Meeting
(as such meeting has been postponed pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)), then the
Outside Date shall be extended until such third (3rd) Business Day following
the date of the postponed Parent Stockholders Meeting.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Parent Board from (i) taking
and disclosing to Parent\'s stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to
Parent\'s stockholders that Parent determines in good faith (after
consultation with Experienced Counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would be 

inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Parent\'s stockholders under
applicable Law or a breach of the disclosure obligations of Parent under
applicable Law or Nasdaq; provided, however, that neither Parent nor the
Parent Board (nor any committee thereof) shall (A) recommend that the
stockholders of the Parent tender their shares of Parent Common Stock in
connection with any such tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve or
recommend any Parent Acquisition Proposal) or (B) withdraw or modify the
Parent Board Recommendation in a manner materially adverse to the Company,
unless in case of each of clause (A) and (B), the requirements of Section
5.3(c) have been satisfied. Any communication by Parent which expressly
continues to recommend the First Lynx Merger shall be deemed not to be a
Parent Board Recommendation Change. No change, withdrawal or material
modification in the recommendation of the Parent Board to Parent\'s
stockholders with respect to this Agreement or the First Lynx Merger shall
change the approval of the Parent Board for purposes of causing any state
takeover Law (including Section 203 of the DGCL) or other state Law to be
inapplicable to the First Lynx Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

Section 5.4 Preparation of Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement; Stockholders
Meeting; Recommendations.

(a) Preparation of Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement.

(i) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent, UK
Holdco and the Company shall cooperate in preparing, and jointly prepare, (i)
the Joint Proxy Statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company and
Parent and filed with the UK Financial Services Authority relating to the
Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, and (ii) the
Form S-4, which Parent and UK Holdco shall file with the SEC, and in which the
Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of the Company,
UK Holdco and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) respond to any
comments on the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement or requests for
additional information from the SEC as promptly as practicable after receipt
of any such comments or requests to have the Form S-4 be declared effective
under the Securities Act and the Joint Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as practicable and keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as
necessary to consummate the Mergers. Each of the Company, UK Holdco and Parent
shall promptly (A) notify the other parties upon the receipt of any such
comments or requests and (B) provide the other parties with copies of all
correspondence between itself and its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC and its staff, on the other hand. Prior to responding to any such
comments or requests or the filing or mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement,
each of the Company, UK Holdco and Parent (x) shall consult with the other
parties regarding, and provide the other parties with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on, any drafts of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement and related correspondence and filings and (y) shall consider for
inclusion in such drafts, correspondence and filings all comments reasonably
proposed by the other parties. Each of Parent, UK Holdco and the Company shall
cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of the Parent
Common Stock and the holders of the Company Common Stock, as applicable, as
promptly as practicable, and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days,
after the Form S-4 shall have become effective and the Joint Proxy Statement
shall have been cleared by the SEC. Each of Parent, UK Holdco and the Company
shall provide promptly to the other parties such information concerning its
business affairs and financial statements as, in the reasonable judgment of
the providing party or its counsel (after consultation 

with the other parties or their respective counsel), may be required or
appropriate for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement and Form S-4 pursuant
to this Section 5.4(a), or in any amendments or supplements thereto, and shall
cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with the other\'s counsel and
auditors in the preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4.

(ii) Parent shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its
capital stock as the Company may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement. Parent and UK Holdco shall also take
any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities or "blue
sky" laws in connection with the issuance of Holdco Shares in the First Viper
Merger and the First Lynx Merger. The Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any such action.

(iii) Except for the purpose of disclosing any Company Board Recommendation
Change or Parent Board Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms
of Section 5.2 or 5.3, as applicable, no amendment or supplement to the Joint
Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, nor any response to any comments or inquiry
from the SEC with respect to such filings, will be made by the Company, UK
Holdco or Parent without the approval of the other parties, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (it being
understood that it shall be unreasonable to withhold consent with respect to
any amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or Form S-4 to the
extent such amendment or supplement is required to be included therein so that
the Joint Proxy Statement or Form S-4 will not contain an untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading as may be required
by Rule 10b-5 or Rule 14a-9 under the Exchange Act or Section 11 or Section 12
of the Securities Act). Each of Parent, UK Holdco and the Company, as
applicable, shall advise the other parties promptly after it receives oral or
written notice of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any
amendment or supplement thereto has been filed, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of the Holdco Shares issuable in
connection with the First Viper Merger and the First Lynx Merger for offering
or sale in any jurisdiction or any oral or written request by the SEC for
amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will
promptly provide the other with copies of any written communication from the
SEC or any state securities commission and a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the responses thereto. If at any time prior to the earlier of
the First Viper Effective Time and the First Lynx Effective Time any
information relating to the Company, UK Holdco or Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the
Company, UK Holdco or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of
such documents would not contain any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
promptly be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under applicable
Law, disseminated to stockholders of the Company and/or Parent; provided,
however, that the delivery of such notice and the filing of any such amendment
or supplement shall not affect or be 

deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereunder or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any party.

(iv) Parent and the Company shall each use their reasonable best efforts to
hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting and the Company Stockholders Meeting on
the same day at the same time as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that (A) the Company and the Company Board shall
not be required to hold, and shall be entitled (in their sole discretion) to
adjourn, delay or postpone, the Company Stockholders Meeting until the fifth
(5th) Business Day following the date on which all conditions set forth in
Sections 6.1(b), 6.1(d) and Section 6.1(e) have been satisfied or waived and
(B) notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions described in
clause (A), the Company and the Company Board shall not be required to hold,
and shall be entitled (in their sole discretion) to adjourn, delay or postpone
the Company Stockholders Meeting if, on the date scheduled therefor, any other
condition set forth in Article VI would not be reasonably capable of being
satisfied as of the third (3rd) Business Day following the scheduled date for
the Company Stockholders Meeting (in which event the Company and the Company
Board may adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting until
such date as such conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied). In
the event the Company adjourns, delays or postpones the Company Stockholders
Meeting pursuant to Section 5.2(d) or this Section 5.4(a)(iv), Parent may
adjourn, delay or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting to the same date as
the Company Stockholders Meeting. In the event Parent adjourns, delays or
postpones the Parent Stockholder Meeting pursuant to Section 5.3(d), the
Company may adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting to the
same date as the Parent Stockholder Meeting. If the conditions set forth in
Sections 6.1(b), 6.1(d) and 6.1(e) have been satisfied (or are reasonably
capable of being satisfied), and if all other conditions set forth in Article
VI (other than Section 6.1(a)) are reasonably capable of being satisfied, in
each case as of the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the Outside Date, then
the Outside Date shall be extended to accommodate any adjournment, delay or
postponement of the Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders
Meeting, as the case may be, pursuant to this Section 5.4(a)(iv) and the three
(3) Business Day period referred to in Section 1.3.

(b) Company Stockholders Meeting. As soon as practicable following the date
hereof, the Company shall, subject to Section 5.4(a)(iv), establish a record
date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting prior to the Outside Date for the purpose of considering and voting
upon the adoption of the "agreement of merger" (as such term is used in
Section 251 of the DGCL) with respect to the Company contained in this
Agreement and the shareholder advisory vote contemplated by Rule 14a-21(c)
under the Exchange Act. Subject to Section 5.2, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Company, through the Company Board, shall (i)
recommend to its stockholders that they approve or adopt this Agreement, the
First Viper Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn
or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure
that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is
provided to the Company\'s stockholders in advance of a vote on the adoption
of this Agreement (provided, however, that the Company has determined after
consultation with Experienced Counsel that such adjournment or postponement is
necessary or advisable under applicable Law), or if, as of the time for which
the Company 

Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of
Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting
or insufficient votes to adopt this Agreement and the plan of merger contained
herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to
Section 5.2 and Section 7.1(d), the Company agrees that its obligations
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.4(b) shall not be affected by
the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company or any other Person of any Company Acquisition Proposal or the
occurrence of any Company Board Recommendation Change. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Company shall be entitled to modify any previously set record date
in connection with any delay or postponement of the Company Stockholders
Meeting if required by applicable Law.

(c) Parent Stockholders Meeting. As soon as practicable following the date
hereof, Parent shall establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting prior to the Outside Date for
the purpose of considering and voting upon the adoption of the "agreement of
merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) with respect to
Parent contained in this Agreement and the shareholder advisory vote
contemplated by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act. Subject to Section 5.3,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent, through the Parent
Board, shall (i) recommend to its stockholders that they approve or adopt this
Agreement, the First Lynx Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent
may adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting to the extent
necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint
Proxy Statement is provided to Parent\'s stockholders in advance of a vote on
the adoption of this Agreement (provided, however, that Parent has determined
after consultation with Experienced Counsel that such adjournment or
postponement is necessary or advisable under applicable Law), or if, as of the
time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, there
are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Parent Stockholders Meeting or insufficient votes to adopt this Agreement and
the plan of merger contained herein. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, but subject to Section 5.3 and Section 7.1(c)(iv), Parent agrees
that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.4(c)
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to Parent or any other Person of any Parent Acquisition
Proposal or the occurrence of any Parent Board Recommendation Change. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent shall be entitled to modify any previously set
record date in connection with any delay or postponement of the Parent
Stockholders Meeting if required by applicable Law.

Section 5.5 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Until the earlier of the
First Viper Effective Time or the First Lynx Effective Time, as applicable,

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to
Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours,
upon reasonable advance notice, to all their respective properties, assets,
books, records, contracts, commitments, personnel and members of their
respective executive management teams, and, during such 

period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to Parent a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws related to
the First Viper Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not require the Company to
disclose any information to the extent such disclosure would contravene
applicable Law, violate any confidentiality obligation to a third party or
relate to information protected by or result in a waiver of, attorney-client
privilege. Within fifteen (15) Business Days of the end of a calendar month,
the Company shall provide Parent with copies of monthly reports in a format
similar to that provided to the Company Board for the prior month. All such
information shall be held confidential in accordance with the terms of the
confidentiality letter agreement entered into between Parent and the Company,
dated December 19, 2012 (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the
Company and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to all their respective properties,
assets, books, records, contracts, commitments, personnel and members of their
respective executive management teams, during such period, Parent shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the Company a
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed
or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
or state securities Laws related to the First Lynx Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the foregoing shall
not require Parent to disclose any information to the extent such disclosure
would contravene applicable Law, violate any confidentiality obligation to a
third party or relate to information protected by or result in a waiver of,
attorney-client privilege. All such information shall be held confidential in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.5 or information provided,
made available or delivered to Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
pursuant to this Agreement, other than the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Parent Disclosure Letter, shall affect any of the representations, warranties,
covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of, the
parties hereunder.

Section 5.6 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions that are reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the Mergers, the Holdco Share Issuance and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish
the following: (i) obtain all required consents, approvals or waivers from
non-Governmental Entity third parties, (ii) obtain all necessary or advisable
actions or non-actions, consents, approvals, waivers, orders and
authorizations from Governmental Entities, make all necessary or advisable

or to avoid any Action by, any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii)
execute and deliver any additional instruments 

necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and fully to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement. In carrying out the foregoing
actions, each of Parent, UK Holdco and the Company shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable.

(b) Each of the parties hereto shall furnish to each other party such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may
reasonably request in connection with the actions required to obtain all
required consents, approvals or waivers from non-Governmental Entity third
parties. Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information,
Parent, UK Holdco and the Company shall each have the right to review in
advance, and shall consult with the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to Parent, UK Holdco or the Company, as the case may be,
and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any such third party in connection
with the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
connection with any proceeding by a private party, each of the parties shall
consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference and, to the
extent not prohibited by such third party, give the other party\'s counsel the
opportunity to attend and observe such meetings and conferences.

(c) Parent shall have primary responsibility for liaising with the European
Commission in relation to the transactions contemplated hereby or, as
relevant, national competition authorities for the purposes of satisfying the
EUMR and Other Approvals Condition Precedent at Section 6.1(b) (including
making appropriate submissions, notifications and filings and agreeing to take
any actions in order to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any
Action by, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Mergers or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement). Without prejudice to the
generality of this sub-section and subject to applicable Law relating to the
exchange of information:

(i) the Company shall furnish to the Parent such necessary information and
assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing;
and

(ii) Parent agrees to permit the Company or its counsel to review in advance
submissions, notifications and filings and where practicable any communication

Company\'s counsel the opportunity to attend and observe such meetings and
conferences.

(d) Each party agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to contest and resist
any action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
party shall be required and no party shall without the consent of the other
party, take, or agree or commit to take, any actions which, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be 

expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets,
liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of UK Holdco and its
Subsidiaries (including the Viper Surviving Corporation and the Lynx Surviving
Corporation), taken as a whole, after the earlier of the First Viper Effective
Time and the First Lynx Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, UK Holdco,
Parent, the Merger Subs and their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to
take or agree to take any actions necessary or advisable in order to satisfy
any objection of any Governmental Entity or to obtain any consent or waiver of
any Government Entity so long as such actions would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of
UK Holdco and its Subsidiaries (including the Viper Surviving Corporation and
the Lynx Surviving Corporation), taken as a whole, following the First Viper
Effective Time and the First Lynx Effective Time.

shall adopt and approve this Agreement and the plan of merger contained herein
in its capacity as the sole member of Lynx Merger Sub 1; (ii) Lynx Merger Sub

the Parent Board shall (a) take no action to cause any Takeover Law to become
applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers, the Holdco Share Issuance or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby and (b) if any Takeover Law is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers, the Holdco Share Issuance
or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, take all reasonable
action necessary to ensure that the Mergers, the Holdco Share Issuance and the
other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as

Mergers, the Holdco Share Issuance and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 5.8 Stockholder and Debtholder Litigation. Each of the Company and
Parent shall cooperate with the other in the defense or settlement of any
litigation relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any litigation initiated by the holders of Indebtedness of the
Company or Parent, against (a) Parent, any of its Subsidiaries and/or its
directors or officers, or (b) the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and/or its
directors of officers. Parent and its Subsidiaries will not agree to any
settlement of any such litigation prior to the First Viper Effective Time
(unless the defendants consist solely of Parent and/or members of the Parent

unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Section 5.9 Notification of Certain Matters. In addition to the notification
requirements set forth in Section 5.4(a), the Company and Parent shall

knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting

that renders or would reasonably be expected to render any representation or
warranty of such party set forth in this Agreement (disregarding any
materiality qualification contained therein) to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect or (ii) that results or would reasonably be expected to
result in any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement (including any condition set
forth in Article VI) to be complied with or satisfied hereunder; provided,
however, that no such notification shall affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the
obligations of, the parties hereunder. No failure by a party to provide any
notice under this Section 5.9 with respect to any matter that would not result
in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.3(a)
shall result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(b) or
Section 6.3(b), respectively.

Section 5.10 Employee Benefits and Related Matters.

(a) UK Holdco shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor all existing
contractual remuneration commitments of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
each employee and, subject to applicable Law, Parent agrees that, during the
period commencing at the First Viper Effective Time and ending on December 31,
2013, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will continue to be
provided with: (i) the same base salaries provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to each such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) employee benefits (other than annual or long-term incentive compensation
arrangements, equity compensation or defined benefit pension plans) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those employee benefits provided
by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the First Viper Effective Time.
In respect of the defined benefit employee benefits provided under the
National Transcommunications Limited Pension Plan and the NTL 1999 Pension
Scheme, their continuation is subject to the terms of the respective plans.

(b) On and after the First Viper Effective Time, UK Holdco shall or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to take into account, for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, calculation of benefits, and benefit accrual thereunder, service by
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service were with UK
Holdco and its Subsidiaries to the same extent such service was credited under
a comparable plan of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits or the funding thereof. UK Holdco or
one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts
to (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements, waiting periods and any other eligibility requirements of any
plan for the benefit of such employee and his or her covered dependents that
applies to them on or after the First Viper Effective Time, to the extent they
were inapplicable to, or were satisfied under, the Company Plans, and (ii)
cause any expenses incurred by any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
and his or her covered dependents pursuant to any Company Plan during the
portion of the plan year of such Company Plan ending on the date such
employee\'s participation in the corresponding plan begins, to be taken into
account under such plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year under the plan as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the plan. For the avoidance of doubt,
an employee\'s active membership in a defined benefit pension plan and any
benefit accruals thereunder shall be ignored for the purposes of this Section
5.10(b). 

(c) With respect to the Company\'s annual incentive bonus plan for the
performance period beginning January 1, 2013 and ending December 31, 2013 (the
"2013 Annual Bonus Plan"), the Company has established a bonus pool, which has
been communicated to Parent and eligible employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the date of this Agreement. UK Holdco shall or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to: (i) maintain following the First Viper Effective
Time the 2013 Annual Bonus Plan, (ii) operate the 2013 Annual Bonus Plan
through the end of the applicable performance period, and (iii) pay to each
eligible employee a bonus amount on or before March 31, 2014 with respect to
such performance period, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the
2013 Annual Bonus Plan; provided, however, that reasonable adjustments may be
made to the applicable performance conditions resulting from the transaction
as determined in good faith by the UK Holdco Board (or authorized committee
thereof) to be equitable and appropriate, and that any discretion exercised by
the UK Holdco Board (or authorized committee thereof) under the terms of the
2013 Annual Bonus Plan in determining the achievement of performance or bonus
amounts shall be exercised in a manner that is consistent with past practice
of the Company. In addition, UK Holdco shall or shall cause its Subsidiaries:
(A) to maintain following the First Viper Effective Time the 2013 commission
and local incentive plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the "2013 Commission Plans"), which are materially consistent
with the terms of the 2012 commission and local incentive plans, and (B) to
operate the 2013 Commission Plans through December 31, 2013 in accordance with
their terms and in a manner that is consistent with past practice of the
Company.

(d) This Section 5.10 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section
5.10, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former directors,
officers, employees, contractors or consultants of any of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the
First Viper Effective Time, UK Holdco, the Surviving Corporations or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, their dependents and beneficiaries) any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.10
or is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or
modification of any employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement of UK Holdco, the Company, the Parent, the Surviving Corporations
or any respective Subsidiary thereof. Nothing herein shall be deemed to create
any right to employment or continued employment or to a particular term or
condition of employment with the UK Holdco, the Surviving Corporations or any
of their respective Affiliates. Except as specifically provided in this
Section 5.10(d), nothing in this Section 5.10 or any other provision of this
Agreement shall limit the ability of UK Holdco, the Surviving Corporations or
any of their Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or
compensation plan, program agreement or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

Section 5.11 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

(a) From and after the First Viper Effective Time and the First Lynx Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporations shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend
and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law each
Person who is, or was at any time prior to the First Lynx Effective Time, an
officer or director of Parent or any Subsidiary thereof and each Person who
served at the request of Parent or any Subsidiary thereof as a director,
officer, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (each, a "Parent Indemnified
Party" and, collectively, the "Parent Indemnified Parties") and each Person
who is, or was at any time prior to the First Viper Effective Time an officer
or director of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof and each Person who
served at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof as a 

director, officer, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (each, a "Company
Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Company Indemnified Parties" and,
together with the Parent Indemnified Parties, the "Indemnified Parties")
against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses
(including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any Action arising out of or pertaining to acts
or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their capacities as
such, whether commenced, asserted or claimed before, at or after the First
Viper Effective Time or the First Lynx Effective Time, as applicable. In the
event of any such Action, (i) the Viper Surviving Corporation and the Lynx
Surviving Corporation shall pay, as incurred, the fees and expenses of counsel
selected by the Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to UK Holdco, in advance of the final disposition of any such
Action to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law so long as such
Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified hereunder, and (ii) UK Holdco and the Viper Surviving Corporation
or the Lynx Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the First Viper Effective Time and the
First Lynx Effective Time, as applicable, the Surviving Corporations shall
maintain in effect the Company\'s, Parent\'s and each of their respective
Subsidiaries\' current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and
fiduciary insurance covering each Person currently covered by the Company\'s,
Parent\'s and each of their respective Subsidiaries\' directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary insurance policies (correct and
complete copies of which have been heretofore made available to Parent) for
acts or omissions occurring prior to the First Viper Effective Time and the
First Lynx Effective Time, respectively; provided, however, that Surviving
Corporations may substitute therefor policies of an insurance company the
material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable
in any material respect to such Persons than the Company\'s, Parent\'s and
their respective Subsidiaries\' existing policies as of the date hereof; and
provided, further, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporations be
required to pay annual premiums for insurance under this Section 5.11(b) in
excess of 300% of the amount of the annual premiums paid or payable by the
Company or Parent, respectively, for fiscal year 2012 for such purpose (which
fiscal year 2012 premiums are hereby represented and warranted by (i) the
Company to be as set forth in Section 5.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter
and (ii) Parent to be as set forth in Section 5.11(b) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter), it being understood that the Surviving Corporations shall
nevertheless be obligated to provide as much coverage as may be obtained for
such 300% amounts. For purposes of applying the limitations described in the
preceding sentence, the amount of premiums available for such coverage shall
be allocated equally as between insurance for the benefit of Persons
previously covered by insurance policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and Persons previously covered by insurance policies of Parent and its
Subsidiaries.

(c) In the event that UK Holdco, the Viper Surviving Corporation or the Lynx
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, or any of their respective successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving 

corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, UK Holdco and the Surviving Corporations shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the successor and assign of UK Holdco, the Viper
Surviving Corporation or the Lynx Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.11 shall survive consummation of the
Mergers and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to any
other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the Company Charter, the
Company Bylaws, the Parent Charter, the Parent Bylaws or comparable
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, under any Contract to which such Indemnified Party is a party and
under applicable Law.

(f) From and after the First Viper Effective Time, UK Holdco shall cause the
Continuing Director to be covered by UK Holdco\'s directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance to the same extent and on the same terms and conditions as
such insurance coverage may be provided from time to time for UK Holdco\'s
other directors.

(g) From and after the First Viper Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Viper Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses for the benefit of the applicable
Indemnified Parties with respect to all periods through the First Viper
Effective Time that are at least as favorable to such Indemnified Parties as
those contained in the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or comparable
organizational documents of such Subsidiaries, as applicable, as in effect on
the date hereof.

Section 5.12 Stock Exchange Listing; Delisting. Parent and UK Holdco shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Holdco Shares issuable to stockholders of
the Company and Parent in the First Viper Merger and the First Lynx Merger to
be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the earlier of the First Viper Effective Time and the First Lynx
Effective Time. UK Holdco, Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each
other in taking all necessary actions to delist the Company Common Stock and
the Parent Common Stock from Nasdaq, to cancel the listing of the Company
Common Stock on the Main Market of the UK Financial Services Authority and the
admission of the same to trading on the London Stock Exchange and to terminate

the First Lynx Effective Time, as applicable.

Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and, subject to Section 5.2 and Section 5.3,
as applicable, the Company 

and Parent shall not issue any such press release or make any public statement
with respect to this Agreement, the Holdco Share Issuance, the Mergers or any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange, national securities quotation system or the London Stock Exchange
(in which case the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall use reasonable best
efforts to allow the other reasonable time to comment on such release or
statement in advance of such issuance to the extent reasonably practicable).
Nothing in this Section 5.13 shall be deemed to require Parent or the Company
to consult with, or obtain the approval of, the other party for any
communication that does not contain any more material information regarding
this Agreement, the Mergers, the Holdco Share Issuance and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or the Support Agreement than contained in

the other party.

Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or Parent, or

(a) UK Holdco and the Viper Surviving Corporation will enter into a
supplemental indenture to the 6.50% Convertible Senior Notes Indenture at the
First Viper Effective Time or at such other time that is permitted under the
6.50% Convertible Senior Notes Indenture providing for the conversion and
settlement of the Company Convertible Notes in accordance with the 6.50%
Convertible Senior Notes Indenture, and will cooperate to provide to the
trustee under the 6.50% Convertible Senior Notes Indenture such officers\'
certificates, including the officer\'s certificate required pursuant to
Section 12.09 of the 6.50% Convertible Senior Notes Indenture, and opinions of
counsel, in each case as may be required by the 6.50% Convertible Senior Notes
Indenture as a result of the First Viper Merger. UK Holdco and the Viper
Surviving Corporation shall give timely all notices required to be given to
holders of the Company Convertible Notes pursuant to, and shall otherwise
comply in all material respects with the terms of, the 6.50% Convertible

Section 5.16 Financing.

(a) Parent, UK Holdco and each of the Merger Subs shall use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, the proceeds of the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Definitive Financing
Agreements, including maintaining in effect the Definitive Financing
Agreements, satisfying on a timely basis all conditions in the Definitive
Financing Agreements the satisfaction of which are within the control of
Parent, UK Holdco or any of the Merger Subs and, unless alternative financing
has been put in place in compliance with the next sentence promptly after any
breach under any of the Definitive Financing Agreements, seeking to enforce
their rights, including seeking specific performance, under any of the
Definitive Financing Agreements in the event of a breach by the other parties
thereto. Parent, UK Holdco and the Merger Subs shall have the right from time
to time to amend, restate, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive
any of its rights under, the Financing Commitments and/or substitute other
financing for all or any portion of the Debt Financing from the same and/or
alternative sources, provided that any such amendment, restatement,
replacement, supplement or other modification to, or waiver of, any provision
of the Financing Commitments shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Company, (i) add new (or adversely modify any existing) condition to the
Financing Commitments (unless such new condition or modification would not be
reasonably expected to prevent or materially hinder or delay the consummation
of the Merger), (ii) reduce the amount of the Debt Financing such that the
aggregate funds that would be available to Parent, UK Holdco and the Merger
Subs at the Closing would not be sufficient to satisfy Parent\'s, UK Holdco\'s
and each of the Merger Subs\' obligations to pay the Cash Consideration as
contemplated by the Financing Commitments, refinance the Scheduled
Indebtedness to the extent required under the terms of such Indebtedness and
finance the payment of fees, expenses, accrued interest and premiums, as
applicable, related to the provision of the Debt Financing or the refinancing
of the Scheduled Indebtedness, or (iii) could reasonably be expected to
prevent, or materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger. Upon
any such amendment, supplement or modification of the Financing Commitments in
accordance with this Section 5.16(a), the term "Financing Commitments" shall
mean the Financing Commitments as so amended, supplemented or modified.
Parent, UK Holdco and each of the Merger Subs shall give the Company prompt
notice of any material breach by any party to the Definitive Financing
Agreements of which Parent, UK Holdco or any of the Merger Subs has become
aware, any condition not likely to be satisfied or any termination of the
Definitive Financing Agreements. In the event that any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor (and such
portion is required for the purposes described in clauses (A), (B) and (C) of
this Section 5.16(a)), Parent, UK Holdco and each of the Merger Subs will (1)
use their reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, alternative debt financing (in an
amount sufficient, when taken together with other sources of funds available
to Parent, UK Holdco and each of the Merger Subs, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (A) to satisfy
Parent\'s, UK Holdco\'s and each of the Merger Subs\' obligations to pay in
full the aggregate Cash Consideration, (B) to refinance the Scheduled
Indebtedness to the extent required under the terms of such indebtedness and
(C) to finance the payment of fees, expenses, accrued interest and premiums,
as applicable, related to the provision of the Debt Financing or the
refinancing of the Scheduled Indebtedness) on terms that are no less
favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent, UK Holdco and the Company from the
same or other sources and that would not reasonably be expected to prevent, or
materially impede or delay the consummation of the Debt Financing or 

the Mergers and (2) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the
reason therefor. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Financing
Commitments" shall be deemed to include any financing commitment or definitive
financing agreement with respect to any alternative financing arranged in
compliance herewith. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to consummate the Debt
Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Parent with this
Section 5.16 shall not relieve Parent, UK Holdco and the Merger Subs of their
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
whether or not the Debt Financing is available.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, including legal and
accounting Representatives, to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent and/or UK Holdco in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing (including any offering or private placement of debt securities),
including (i) furnishing Parent, UK Holdco and the Financing Parties as
promptly as practicable as required by the Financing Commitments with
financial information and other pertinent information regarding the Company
and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested (and updated as reasonably
requested) by Parent and/or UK Holdco to consummate the Debt Financing and is
customary to be included in (x) marketing materials for senior secured and/or

clause (i), together with all such other information required by the Financing
Commitments, (collectively, the "Required Information"); provided, however,
that the Required Information shall not include, and Parent and UK Holdco

savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other post-Closing pro forma
adjustments desired to be incorporated into any information used in connection
with the Debt Financing), (ii) participating in a reasonable number of
meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as
lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the
Debt Financing and senior management, representatives or advisors, with
appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company and its Subsidiaries),
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Debt Financing, and

of the facilities or notes issued in connection with the Debt Financing from
each of SandP and Moody\'s, (vi) assist in the preparation of one or more credit
or other agreements, as well as any pledge and security documents, and other

consistent with this Agreement, any supplemental indenture that is required to
implement any amendment, waiver or other modification approved in such consent
solicitation (provided that such amendment, waiver or other modification will
not continue to be effective if the Mergers are not consummated); provided,
however, that Parent shall be obligated to pay, or simultaneously reimburse
the Company for, any consent fee and other fees or expenses incurred in
connection with such consent solicitation. The foregoing notwithstanding, (A)
except to the extent necessary to authorize actions set forth in clauses (i)
to (xi) in the prior sentence, neither the Company nor any Persons who are
directors of the Company shall be required to pass resolutions or consents to
approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing, (B) no obligation of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives under any certificate, document or instrument executed
pursuant to the foregoing shall be effective until the Closing, (C) none of
the Company or its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives

the Company and its Subsidiaries and (E) no obligation set forth herein will
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that will

applicable Law. Nothing contained in this Section 5.16(b) or otherwise shall
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Effective Time,
to be 

an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing. Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives in connection with such cooperation and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives for and against any and all losses, claims, costs
and expenses actually suffered or incurred by them, as incurred, in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or any action taken by them at the
request of Parent or UK Holdco pursuant to this Section 5.16(b), except in the
event it is determined by a competent court in a final and non-appealable
judgment that such losses result from the willful misconduct, gross
negligence, fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, and pending any such
judgment, Parent shall promptly pay (and advance all expenses in connection
with) all such indemnification claims. The Company hereby consents to the use
of its and its Subsidiaries\' logos in connection with the Debt Financing;
provided, however, that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

or its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent, UK Holdco or their Representatives
pursuant to this Section 5.16 shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
condition set forth in Section 6.2(b), as it applies to the Company\'s
obligations under Section 5.16(b), shall be deemed satisfied unless the
Company\'s breaches of its obligations under Section 5.16(b) prevented Parent
and/or UK Holdco from having funds available to fund the aggregate Cash
Consideration.

or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the

receive the Company Merger Consideration to which each such stockholder of the
Company is entitled pursuant to Article II and (iii) nothing in this Agreement
shall modify, alter or otherwise derogate from any right or remedy available
to any stockholder of the Company under the Exchange Act in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 8.7 Governing Law. This Agreement and all disputes or controversies
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the Laws of any other
jurisdiction that might be applied because of the conflicts of Laws principles
of the State of Delaware.

Section 8.8 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties irrevocably agrees
that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any party or its Affiliates against any other party or
its Affiliates shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware; provided, however, that if jurisdiction is not then
available in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then any such
legal action or proceeding may be brought in any federal court located in the
State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its
property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of the parties agrees not to commence any action,
suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the courts described above in
the State of Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent
jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such
court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the parties further agrees that
notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and
the parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each
of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not
to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of such courts in the State of Delaware as
described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (c) that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court
is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or
proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts.

Section 8.9 Assignment; Successors. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any party
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors
and assigns. 

Section 8.10 Specific Performance; Remedies. The parties acknowledge and agree
that each of the parties would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions
of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
are otherwise breached and that any non-performance, breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement by any party could not be adequately compensated by
monetary damages alone and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy
at Law. Accordingly, each party shall be entitled (in addition to any other
remedy that may be available to it whether in Law or equity, including
monetary damages) to seek and obtain (a) enforcement of any provision of this
Agreement by a decree or order of specific performance and (b) a temporary,
preliminary and/or permanent injunction to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of any provisions of this Agreement without posting any bond or
undertaking. The parties hereto further agree that they shall not object to
the granting of injunctive or other equitable relief on the basis that there
exists adequate remedy at Law. Each of the parties hereby expressly further
waives (i) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at
Law would be adequate or that an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity and (b) any requirement
under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equity relief.
Each party agrees that its initial choice of remedy will be to seek specific
performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. If a court of
competent jurisdiction denies such relief, the parties may seek alternative
remedies, including damages in the same or another proceeding.

Section 8.11 Currency. All references to "dollars" or "$" in this Agreement
refer to United States dollars, which is the currency used for all purposes in
this Agreement unless otherwise specified. All references to "pounds sterling"
or "£" in this Agreement refer to the British pound. The application of any
provision of this Agreement denominated in dollars as it may relate to a
Contract obligation, liability or other amount denominated in another
currency, shall be interpreted based on prevailing exchange rates in effect on
the date hereof unless an alternate currency is also specified in the relevant
provision.

Section 8.12 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible and the
relevant provision may be given effect to the fullest extent consistent with
applicable Law.

Section 8.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND
SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 8.13. 

Section 8.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party.

Section 8.15 Facsimile or PDF Signature. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile signature or by emailed portable document format (.pdf) file
signature and a facsimile or .pdf signature shall constitute an original for
all purposes.

Section 8.16 Obligations of Parent and the Company. Whenever this Agreement
requires UK Holdco, any of the Merger Subs or any other Subsidiary of Parent
to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking
on the part of Parent to cause UK Holdco, the applicable Merger Sub or such
other Subsidiary to take such action (including an undertaking on the part of
Parent to provide to UK Holdco, Merger Sub or such Subsidiary all funds
necessary to take such action). Parent will take all actions necessary to
ensure that, prior to the First Viper Effective Time and the First Lynx
Effective Time, neither UK Holdco nor any of the Merger Subs shall conduct any
business or make any investments or incur or guarantee any Indebtedness other
than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the First Viper Effective Time,
on the part of the Viper Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action.

Section 8.17 No Presumption Against Drafting Party. Each of Parent, UK Holdco,
each of the Merger Subs and the Company acknowledges that each party to this
Agreement has been represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of
law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed
ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application
and is expressly waived.
