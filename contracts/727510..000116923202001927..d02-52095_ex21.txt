and hold harmless the Acquiror and its Affiliates from and against, any and all
out-of-pocket costs of cooperation with Elan Companies seeking to obtain or

Date. Once authorization, approval or waiver of or consent for the sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such Contract not sold,
assigned, transferred, conveyed or delivered at the applicable Closing is
obtained, the Elan Companies shall assign, transfer, convey and deliver such
Contract to the Acquiror at no additional cost to the Acquiror. Notwithstanding

            Section 4.01. Purchase Price. (a) As consideration for the Purchased
Assets, at the Closing, the Acquiror shall:

            (i) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Elan Companies the sum
      of $370 million, payable on the Closing Date by electronic funds transfer
      of immediately available funds to the accounts of such entities as are
      designated by the Elan Companies not less than two Business Days prior to
      the Closing Date (the "Purchase Price"); and

            (ii) assume the Assumed Liabilities.

            (b) At the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the
lesser of (i) the sum of (x) Pre-Closing Net Product Sales and (y) the

Post-November 15 Adjustment.

            Section 4.02. Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall
be allocated among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code, and the Acquiror and the Elan Companies agree (a) to report the sale and
purchase of the Purchased Assets for Tax purposes in accordance with such
allocations and (b) not to take any position inconsistent with such allocations
on any of their respective tax returns. The Elan Companies shall initially
determine and send written notice to the Acquiror of the allocation of the
Closing Purchase Price within 60 days following the execution of this Agreement.
The Acquiror will be deemed to have accepted such allocation unless it provides
written notice of disagreement to the Elan Companies within 10 days of receipt
of the Elan Companies' notice of allocation. If the Acquiror provides such
notice of disagreement to the Elan Companies, the parties shall proceed in good
faith to determine the allocation in dispute. If within 10 days after the Elan
Companies receive the Acquiror's notice of disagreement the parties have not
reached agreement, the Accountants shall be engaged to determine the final
allocation in dispute. The Elan Companies and the Acquiror shall share equally
the fees of such Accountants.

            Section 4.03. Payment of Sales, Use and Other Taxes. The Elan
Companies, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other hand, shall share
equally all sales, use, transfer, value added and other related Taxes, if any,
arising out of the sale by the Elan Companies and their respective Affiliates of
the Purchased Assets to the Acquiror pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
however, that the Elan Companies shall pay all Indiana gross income taxes in the
form of tax stamps to be attached

to the deed transferring the Plant at Closing to the Marion County Treasurer's
Office at the time of recording such deed at Closing.

            Section 4.04. Closing Date Inventory Value Adjustments. (a) As
promptly as practicable, but in any event not later than 30 days after the
Closing, the Elan Companies shall prepare and deliver to the Acquiror a
statement calculating the Closing Date Inventory Value (the "Closing Date
Inventory Value Statement").

            (b) During the 30 day period immediately following the Acquiror's
receipt of the Closing Date Inventory Value Statement, the Acquiror shall be
permitted to review the Elan Companies' books and records reasonably necessary
for the preparation of the Closing Date Inventory Value Statement. The Closing
Date Inventory Value Statement shall become final and binding upon the Acquiror
and the Elan Companies at the end of such 30 day period, unless the Acquiror
objects to the Closing Date Inventory Value Statement, in which case it shall
send written notice (the "Notice of Objection") to the Elan Companies within
such period, setting forth in specific detail the basis for its objection and
its proposal for any adjustments to the Closing Date Inventory Value Statement.
If a timely Notice of Objection is received by the Elan Companies, then the
Closing Date Inventory Value Statement shall become final and binding (except as
provided below with respect to resolution of disputes) on the Elan Companies and
the Acquiror on the first to occur of (x) the date the Elan Companies and the
Acquiror resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Objection and (y) the date all matters in
dispute are finally resolved in writing by the Third Party Accounting Firm (as
defined), in each case as provided below. The Elan Companies and the Acquiror
shall seek in good faith to reach agreement as to any such proposed adjustment
or that no such adjustment is necessary within 10 days following receipt of the
Notice of Objection. If agreement is reached in writing within such 10 day
period as to all proposed adjustments, or that no adjustments are necessary, the
parties shall revise the Closing Date Inventory Value Statement accordingly. If
the Elan Companies and the Acquiror are unable to reach agreement within 10 days
following receipt of the Notice of Objection, then such certified public
accounting firm of national reputation other than the auditors of the Elan
Companies and the Acquiror as agreed upon by the Elan Companies and the Acquiror
(the "Third Party Accounting Firm") shall be engaged at that time to review the
Closing Date Inventory Value Statement, and shall make a determination as to the
resolution of any adjustments. The determination of the Third Party Accounting
Firm shall be delivered as soon as practicable following engagement of the Third
Party Accounting Firm, but in no event more than 30 days thereafter, and shall
be final, conclusive and binding upon the Elan Companies and the Acquiror and
the parties shall revise the Closing Date Inventory Value Statement accordingly.
The Elan Companies, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other hand, shall
each pay one-half of the cost of the Third Party Accounting Firm. Within 10 days
of the date on which the Closing Date Inventory Value Statement becomes final
and binding on the Elan Companies and the Acquiror, the Acquiror shall pay the
Elan Companies the Closing Date Inventory Value Adjustment to the Elan
Companies, if positive, and the Elan Companies shall pay the Closing Date
Inventory Value Adjustment to the Acquiror, if negative.

            (b) In furtherance of and in addition to subsection (a), none of the
Elan Companies shall (i) except in the Ordinary Course of Business incur any
Liability which would be an Assumed Liability, (ii) except as contemplated by
this Agreement or the Related Agreements enter into, amend, modify, terminate
(partially or completely), grant any waiver under or give any consent with
respect to any Contract which would be an Assumed Liability or incur any
Liability which would be an Assumed Liability outside the Ordinary Course of
Business unless the executory obligation on the part of such Elan Company in any
such individual case is less than $10,000, (iii) violate, breach or Default
under, or take or fail to take any action that (with or without notice or lapse
of time or both) would constitute a violation or breach of, or a Default under
any term or provision of any material Contract, (iv) other than pursuant to or
in connection with its financing arrangements with its lenders create any
Encumbrance on any of the Purchased Assets, (v) except in the Ordinary Course of
Business, alter the salaries or other compensation payable to any Business
Employee or Canadian Sales Force Employee or (vi) sell Product in the Territory
other than in the Ordinary Course of Business and, to the extent the Closing has
not occurred by November 15, 2002, generate more than $1.5 million per week (or
fraction thereof) of Net Sales Revenue from such date. Each Elan Company shall
maintain and service the Purchased Assets consistent with past practice and use
its best commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact the Business as it
is currently organized.

            Section 8.02. Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Following the date
hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all action, or to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to cause the
conditions to the obligations of the other party hereto to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby to be satisfied at the Closing, including (i)
obtaining all consents and approvals of all Persons and Governmental or
Regulatory Authorities and removing any injunctions or other Encumbrances, other
than Permitted Encumbrances, on the Purchased Assets, impairments or delays the
obtaining or removal of which are necessary, proper or advisable to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
commercially reasonable efforts by Elan Parent to prepare and disseminate to its
shareholders a "Class 1 Circular" in accordance with the requirements of the UK
Listing Authority and the Dublin Stock Exchange for the solicitation of the
approval by Elan Parent's shareholders of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Related Agreements, and to duly and promptly convene a meeting
of such shareholders (the "Elan Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of voting
on such approval and to seek such shareholder approval.

            Section 8.03. Cooperation. (a) Following the date hereof, each party
shall cooperate fully with the other in preparing and promptly filing all
notices, applications, submissions, reports and other instruments and documents
that are necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Elan Companies' cooperation in the efforts of the Acquiror to obtain any
consents and approvals of any Governmental or Regulatory Authority required for
the Acquiror to be able to own the Purchased Assets. In any event, Elan
Companies shall have filed transfer letters with FDA for all Product
Registra-


                                      -42-
<PAGE>

tions and for all Manufacturing Process and Plant Registrations no later than
five days after the Closing Date.

            (b) Following the date hereof, each party shall cooperate with and
take commercially reasonable actions required by Governmental or Regulatory
Authorities to permit the Elan Companies and their Affiliates outside the
Territory and the Acquiror and its Affiliates inside the Territory to obtain all
consents, approvals, registrations, certificates, permits, licenses or other
approvals of applicable Governmental or Regulatory Authorities required, (i) in
the case of the Elan Companies and their Affiliates, to export the Product from
the Territory and to import, market, promote, sell and distribute the Product in
any and all jurisdictions outside the Territory ("Marketing Authorizations") and
(ii) in the case of the Acquiror and its Affiliates, to market, promote, sell
and distribute the Product in the Territory. Such assistance may include
providing reasonable data, technical information, or other information owned or
controlled by such party and required by Governmental or Regulatory Authority to
obtain or maintain the Marketing Authorizations or Product Registrations, as the
case may be. Each party shall instruct its employees and financial advisors to
provide such cooperation to the other, it being understood that the requesting
party shall reimburse the responding party promptly for reasonable and necessary
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the responding party in complying with any
such request by or on behalf of the requesting party.

            Solely with respect to the manufacture of the Product in the United
States, and additionally with respect to the Elan Companies, their Affiliates
and their sublicensees, solely as required by applicable law for any Marketing
Authorizations, each party hereby grants reference rights under all Product
Registrations, including, without limitation, any Drug Master File for the
Product to the Elan Companies, their Affiliates and their sublicensees or the
Acquiror, its Affiliates and their sublicensees and agrees to rights of
reference or their regulatory equivalent, as the case may be, and agrees to
execute or cause its Affiliates, sublicensees or agents to execute any necessary
authorization letters as may be reasonably required.

            (c) All rights afforded to the Elan Companies or their Affiliates
under this Section 8.03(b) and (c) are freely transferable, in whole or in part,
with that portion or the business, assets or rights transferred by the Elan
Companies or their Affiliates to which such rights relate. Except as where such
a change is not likely to cause the Elan Companies or their Affiliates a
material impact on a Product Registration or Marketing Authorization or the
right to make or have made provided for in the License Agreement, the Acquiror
shall not, without first consulting with the Elan Companies where practical,
make any material change in the Drug Master File or the Product Registrations or
Marketing Authorizations relating to the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control
filings made as of the Closing Date. The Elan Companies shall be provided ninety
(90) days prior notice of any such change.

            (d) The Elan Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts
(and the Acquiror shall cooperate with the Elan Companies) to take all steps
required under the Food and Drugs Act (Canada) to ensure that the DEL is
maintained in full force and effect, including causing the holder of the DEL to
prepare and file an application to amend the DEL as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements, and to cause the
holder of the DEL to make all required filings and notices to Health Canada of
any changes to information previously re-


                                      -43-
<PAGE>

ported to Health Canada arising out of transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Related Agreements.

            (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Elan Companies shall fully provide to Acquiror, and shall cause their
accountants to fully cooperate, at Acquiror's expense, in providing Acquiror on
or prior to the Closing, such audited financial statements for the three most
recent fiscal years concerning the Product, the Business, the Plant or such
other audited financial information as may be required by applicable Law to be
disclosed or reported by Acquiror concerning the Product, the Business, the
Plant or as may be reasonably requested by Acquiror in connection therewith.

            (f) Commencing upon the date of this Agreement, in a reasonably
prompt manner and, working together, the parties shall identify an alternative
supplier of Amphotericin B and the Acquiror, at its sole cost and expense shall
take such steps that are customary and reasonable in the industry to validate
and qualify such supplier as a supplier of Amphotericin B in each country
outside of the Territory where the Elan Companies have launched Abelcet (a
"Second Ampho B Source"). After the Acquiror has discharged its obligation in
the preceding sentence, the Elan Companies shall, in a reasonably prompt manner,
with respect to each country outside of the Territory in which the Elan
Companies have launched Abelcet and at its sole cost and expense, obtain those
approvals, or as applicable waivers, required by applicable local Law as may be
required to permit the use of the Second Ampho B Source as a source of raw
materials for Abelcet in each country outside of the Territory in which the Elan
Companies have launched Abelcet. Between the date of the execution of this
Agreement and two (2) days prior to the Closing Date, the parties shall agree
upon a schedule for the validation and qualification of the Second Ampho B
Source with respect to each country outside of the Territory in which Elan has
launched Abelcet. The Aquiror and the Elan Companies shall consult with each
other and shall provide regular reports on the status of their respective
activities under this paragraph.

            (g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the
parties may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Article IX or
Article X, as applicable, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such
party's failure to use its reasonable efforts to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements, as required by and
subject to this Section 8.03.

            Section 8.04. Risk of Loss. The Elan Companies shall bear all risk
of loss with respect to the Plant and the Plant Assets unless and until the
Closing occurs. If the Plant, the Plant Assets, or any part thereof, is damaged
or destroyed by fire, or other casualty prior to the Closing, then the Acquiror
shall have the right to receive assignment of all insurance proceeds, including
any applicable deductible.

            Section 8.05. Access. (a) From the date hereof until the Closing,
Elan Companies shall permit Acquiror and its representatives to have access,
during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance Notice, to the
Transferred Assets that will be transferred at the Closing and any associated
aspects of the Business and shall provide Acquiror with all assistance,
information and data reasonably requested by Acquiror in connection with
Acquiror's rights and obligations under


                                      -44-
<PAGE>

Section 8.10 hereof, and shall permit the Sales Force Employees, Canadian Sales
Force Employees and Plant Employees to cooperate with Acquiror in connection
therewith, all subject to reasonable rules and regulations of Elan Companies and
any applicable Laws. Elan Companies shall instruct their respective employees,
counsel and financial advisors to cooperate with Acquiror in its investigation
of the Business, it being understood that Acquiror shall reimburse Elan
Companies promptly for reasonable and necessary out of pocket expenses incurred
by Elan Companies in complying with any such request by or on behalf of
Acquiror.

            (b) Upon the reasonable request of Elan Companies, Acquiror shall at
all times following the Closing, to the extent permitted by Law, grant to Elan
Companies and their respective representatives the right, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable prior Notice, to inspect and copy the Books and
Records and other documents in Acquiror's possession to the extent pertaining to
the operation of the Business prior to the Closing Date for Tax purposes and in
connection with Actions or Proceedings involving third parties (except as
otherwise stated in Section 8.05(c) below). Elan Companies shall maintain all
such Books and Records, and any information derived therefrom, as confidential
information of Acquiror in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.06 of
this Agreement.

            (c) Following the date hereof, each of the parties agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to keep and maintain all Books and Records and
other documents in existence on the Closing. Acquiror further agrees to make its
personnel and those of its Affiliates reasonably available to the other parties
or their respective representatives to the extent such access is reasonably
related to any Excluded Assets, or is otherwise reasonably necessary to comply
with the terms of this Agreement or to comply with any applicable Law, it being
understood that the parties requesting access shall reimburse the other party
promptly for its reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
complying with any such request.

            (d) Elan Companies agree to make personnel of Elan Companies or
their Affiliates reasonably available to Acquiror or its respective
representatives to the extent such access is reasonably related to any Purchased
Assets, or is otherwise reasonably necessary for Acquiror to comply with the
terms of this Agreement or to comply with any applicable Law, it being
understood that Acquiror shall reimburse Elan Companies promptly for their
reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred in complying with any
such request by or on behalf of Acquiror.

            (e) Acquiror, from time to time prior to the Closing, shall have the
right to inspect and investigate the Plant and audit and copy all existing
books, records, surveys, plans and all other materials relating to the Plant,
perform surveys, make engineering studies and perform whatever tests and
evaluations of the Plant as Acquiror may elect, all either independently or
through agents, representatives or contractors of Acquiror's choosing; provided,
however, that such actions shall not include the right to conduct any sampling
or testing, including, without limitation, sampling or testing of soil, surface
water, ground water or wastes or perform any other intrusive acts. Such
investigation by Acquiror may include: (i) matters relating to governmental and
other legal requirements with respect to the Plant, including taxes,
assessments, zoning, use permit requirements and building codes; (ii) compliance
with zoning, land use, building, environmental and other statutes, rules, or
regulations applicable to the Plant; (iii) the operation, management and
physical condition of the Plant, including


                                      -45-
<PAGE>

the interior, the exterior, the square footage of the improvements, the
structure, the roof, the paving, the utilities, and all other physical,
functional and other aspects of the Plant; and (iv) all matters relating to the
income and operating or capital expenses of the Plant and all related financial
matters. In connection with any entry by Acquiror or any of its agents,
employees or contractors onto the Plant, Acquiror shall give Elan Companies
reasonable advance Notice of such entry and shall conduct such entry and any
inspections so as to reasonably minimize interference with the business
conducted therein.

            (f) At the Closing, Elan Companies shall deliver to Acquiror all
necessary photo-ready art (or its substantial equivalent) for all Marketing
Materials, and for all packaging and labeling for the Product in the Territory,
including all related artwork and inserts.

            Section 8.06. Public Announcements; Confidentiality. (a) Each of the
Elan Companies and the Acquiror agrees that, prior to the Closing, it and its
representatives shall keep the facts surrounding the negotiation of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, any disclosures made herein
and hereunder, confidential and shall not disclose such information to any other
Person, except for its advisors, accountants, attorneys, consultants and agents
with a need to know and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of such
information, through a press release or otherwise (except as necessary to carry
out the terms of this Agreement or to the extent such information becomes public
information or generally available to the public through no fault of such party
or its Affiliates) without the prior written consent of the other party, unless
such party has been advised by counsel that disclosure is required to be made
under applicable Law or the requirements of a national securities exchange or
another similar regulatory body.

            (b) Each party shall not, and shall require that its Affiliates and
its and their distributors do not, use or reveal or disclose to third parties
any Confidential Information without first obtaining the written consent of the
other party, except as may be reasonably necessary in performing such party's
obligations or exercising such party's rights under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may disclose any Confidential
Information to its Advisors and Affiliates and its and their distributors on a
need-to-know basis only, and such party shall be responsible for such Persons'
compliance with the provisions of this paragraph with respect thereto. Each
party shall take, and shall require its Advisors and Affiliates and its and
their distributors to take, reasonable steps to prevent any unauthorized use or
disclosure of any Confidential Information. The foregoing obligations in this
Section 8.06 shall not apply to information which (i) is or becomes a matter of
public knowledge through no fault of a party or any Person to whom such party
provided such information, (ii) is reasonably required to be disclosed in
connection with obtaining or maintaining Patent Rights or regulatory approvals
for the Product or a Current Product Improvement, or (iii) is required by Law to
be disclosed, provided that the disclosing party uses reasonable efforts to give
the other party advance written notice of such required disclosure in sufficient
time to enable the other party to seek confidential treatment for such
information, and provided further that the disclosing party limits the
disclosure to that information which is required to be disclosed. As used
herein, "Confidential Information" means all Know-How and any proprietary or
trade secret information or data relating to the Product or a Current Product
Improvement or such other information that either party identifies to the other
in writing as confidential.

            (c) From and after the date hereof until the Closing, the provisions
of the confidentiality agreement dated as of August 16, 2002 between the Elan
Parent and the Acquiror (the "Confidentiality Agreement") shall apply to any
information disclosed to the Acquiror pursuant to this Agreement or any Related
Agreement, or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
except as otherwise provided by this Agreement (including Sections 8.05 and
8.10). Following the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate in
its entirety, with no further obligation on the part of any party thereto. In
addition, the transactions contemplated by the Agreement shall not constitute a
breach or violation of the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

            Section 8.07. Corporate Names. (a) Except as set forth in this
Section 8.07, Acquiror shall promptly, and in any event within 120 days after
the Closing Date, complete the revision of all advertising and promotional
materials and literature relating to the Product (i) to delete all references to
the Corporate Names and (ii) to delete all references to Elan Companies' or
their respective Affiliates' customer service address or phone number; provided,
however, that for a period of 120 days from the Closing Date Acquiror may
continue to distribute advertising and promotional materials and literature that
use the Corporate Names, addresses or phone numbers to the extent that such
advertising and promotional materials and literature exist on the Closing Date;
and provided, further, that the Corporate Names may remain on any advertising
and promotional materials and literature to the extent required by Law or any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority for any reason, including due to the fact
that one of the Elan Companies is the manufacturer of the Product. Subject to
the terms and conditions herein, Elan Companies hereby grant a non-exclusive
license to Acquiror and its Affiliates to use the Corporate Names on all
advertising and promotional materials and literature for the Product (including
any Promotional Materials), to the extent specified herein. Acquiror will
destroy its inventory of any remaining advertising and promotional materials and
literature in its possession bearing the Corporate Names, address, or phone
number, which Corporate Names, address and phone numbers are not deleted
pursuant to Section 8.07(a)(i) and (ii), within 140 days after the Closing Date.
In no event shall Acquiror use any of the Corporate Names after the Closing in
any manner or for any purpose different from the use of such Corporate Names by
Elan Companies during the 90-day period immediately preceding the Closing.

            (b) Acquiror shall be entitled to continue to use the existing
Labeling and packaging for the Product until such time as Acquiror has prepared
and filed with the appropriate regulatory authorities, and such authorities
approve, if required, new Labeling that does not contain references to the
Corporate Names; provided, however, that, if Acquiror does not prepare within
120 days after the Closing Date final specifications for the revised Labeling
and packaging for the Product, including all necessary photo-ready art (or its
substantial equivalent) reflecting such modification, the right of Acquiror
described in this sentence shall terminate 120 days after the Closing Date.
Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Elan Companies hereby grant a
non-exclusive right and license to Acquiror to use the Corporate Names on
Labeling and packaging for the Product to the extent specified herein.

            (c) "Corporate Names" means the trademark "Elan," the Elan corporate
logo, and trade names of the Elan Companies, including the word "Elan" together
with variations and derivatives thereof and any other logos, symbols or
trademarks, trade names or service marks of the Elan Companies or their
respective Affiliates, but excluding the Product Trademarks.


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

            (d) The Elan Companies retain and shall retain all right, title and
interest in and to the Corporate Names. Acquiror expressly acknowledges that the
Elan Companies own the Corporate Names, and agrees that it will not attack,
dispute or contest the validity of or ownership of the Corporate Names, or any
registrations issued or issuing with respect thereto. Acquiror further agrees
that all use of the Corporate Names by Acquiror or its Affiliates shall be for
the benefit of Elan Companies and the goodwill accrued in connection with its
use of the Corporate Names shall accrue to Elan Parent and/or Elan Companies as
appropriate. In the event Acquiror acquires any rights relating to the Corporate
Names for any reason, Acquiror agrees to assign, at no cost, all such rights,
together with any related goodwill, to Elan Parent or Elan Companies as
appropriate. Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts not to do any
act which should reasonably be expected to endanger, destroy or similarly affect
the value of the goodwill pertaining to the Corporate Names and further agrees
that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the same quality of
the Product as used by Elan Companies in the operation of the Business as of the
Closing for any Product sold under the Corporate Names. Acquiror will at any
time execute any documents reasonably required by Elan Companies to confirm Elan
Companies' ownership of all such rights in the Corporate Names. Acquiror shall
not use in connection with the Product, or allow any of its Affiliates to use in
connection with the Product, any other trademark or trade name which is similar
to or substantially similar to or so nearly resembles the Corporate Names as to
be likely to cause deception or confusion.

            Section 8.08. Product Trademarks. (a) Acquiror shall retain all
right, title and interest in and to the Product Trademarks in the Territory, and
Elan Companies shall retain all right, title and interest in and to any foreign
counterparts to the Product Trademarks outside of the Territory. Each party
expressly acknowledges that the other party owns its respective trademarks
relating to the Product and agrees that it will not attack, dispute or contest
the validity of such other party's ownership of such trademarks, or any
registrations issued or issuing with respect thereto. Each party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts not to do any act which should reasonably be
expected to endanger, destroy or similarly affect the value of the goodwill
pertaining to the other party's trademarks relating to the Product and further
agrees that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the same
quality of the Product as used by Elan Companies in the operation of the
Business as of the Closing for any Product sold under such trademarks. Each
party shall not use in connection with the Product, or allow any of its
Affiliates to use in connection with the Product, any other trademark or trade
name which is similar to or substantially similar to or so nearly resembles such
trademarks as to be likely to cause deception or confusion.

            (b) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use commercially
reasonable efforts to protect their respective trademarks used in connection
with the Product from infringement by third parties. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party shall promptly notify the other party of any known,
threatened or suspected infringement, imitation or unauthorized use of or unfair
competition relating to such trademarks. Each party shall reasonably cooperate
with the other party in any action taken by the other party to enforce, or
defend, its respective rights in such trademarks, at the expense of such other
party.

            (c) Acquiror shall be solely responsible for determining the uses of
any Internet domain names included within the Product Trademarks in the
Territory. Elan Companies shall be


                                      -48-
<PAGE>

solely responsible for determining the uses of any Internet domain names not
included in the Product Trademarks and outside the Territory.

            Section 8.09. Regulatory Matters. (a) From and after the transfer by
Elan Companies to Acquiror of each Registration pursuant to the terms hereof,
Acquiror shall be solely responsible and liable for (i) taking all actions,
paying all fees and conducting all communication with the appropriate
Governmental or Regulatory Authority required by Law in respect of such
Registration, including preparing and filing all reports (including adverse drug
experience reports) with the appropriate Governmental or Regulatory Authority,
(ii) taking all actions and conducting all communication with third parties in
respect of the Product sold pursuant to such Registration (whether sold before
or after transfer of such Registration), including responding to all complaints
in respect thereof, including complaints related to tampering or contamination,
and (iii) investigating all complaints and adverse drug experiences in respect
of the Product sold pursuant to such Registration (whether sold before or after
transfer of such Registration).

            (b) Each of the parties shall make its facilities relating to the
Product available at reasonable times during normal business hours or as
otherwise required by Law for inspection by representatives of applicable
Governmental or Regulatory Authorities. Each of the parties shall notify the
other party within five days following receipt of any Notice of any FDA or other
Governmental or Regulatory Authority inspection, investigation or other inquiry,
or other material governmental Notice, involving the sale, manufacture or use of
the Product including any Notice that (a) raises any material concern regarding
the safety or efficacy, or manufacturing, of any raw materials, active
ingredients or the Product; (b) raises any material concern regarding FDA's or
any other Governmental or Regulatory Authority's acceptance of any data or
information submitted with respect to the Product, requests any additional data
or information with respect to the Product, or suggests that requests for
additional data or information may be forthcoming; (c) asserts a potential
material liability for either party to a third party arising in connection with
the Product; (d) asserts suspected or actual Product tampering or contamination
or other material problems with respect to the Product, (e) is reasonably likely
to lead to a recall or market withdrawal of the Product in any country; or (f)
concerns any on-going or potential FDA or other Governmental or Regulatory
Authority investigation, inspection, detention, seizure or injunction involving
the Product, including the receipt of any warning letter or untitled letter
relating to the Product. The parties shall cooperate with each other during any
such inspection, investigation or other inquiry. The parties shall discuss any
response to observations or notifications received in connection with any such
inspection, investigation or other inquiry and each party shall give the other
party an opportunity to comment upon any proposed response before it is made.
Each of the parties shall provide the other party with copies of all
correspondence received by it from, or filed by it with, any Governmental or
Regulatory Authority to the extent pertaining to the Product and/or its
distribution, marketing, sale or promotion.

            (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or the joint written procedures,
the Acquiror shall exclusively have the right to determine regulatory strategies
in the Territory, and Elan Companies shall have such exclusive rights outside
the Territory.

            Section 8.10. Employee Matters. (a) As of the Closing Date, Acquiror
shall offer to employ on an at-will basis each of the sales force employees
selected pursuant to the selection pro-


                                      -49-
<PAGE>

cedures set forth on Schedule 8.10 (the "Sales Force Employees") and each Plant
employee set forth on Schedule 8.10 (the "Plant Employees" and, together with
the Sales Force Employees, the "Business Employees"), in each case at a total
cash compensation or hourly rate not less than the total cash compensation or
hourly rate then applicable to such employee immediately prior to the Closing;
provided, however, that the total cash compensation or hourly rate in effect
immediately before the Closing Date for each Business Employee shall not be
greater than the total cash compensation or hourly rate set forth on Schedule
6.07 of the Elan Disclosure Schedule with respect to such Business Employee.
Each Business Employee who becomes employed by Acquiror is herein referred to as
a "Hired Employee". Elan Companies shall reasonably permit representatives of
the Acquiror to communicate and meet with each prospective Hired Employee prior
to the Closing Date for purposes of recruitment and retention of such Hired
Employee and other human resources-related activities in preparation for
Acquiror's acquisition of the Business and the Plant, and the Elan Companies
shall permit management-level Plant Employees to cooperate with Acquiror on a
reasonable basis for such purposes.

            (b) Effective as of the Closing Date, all Hired Employees shall
cease participation in all Employee Benefit Plans.

            (c) Effective as of the date of hire by Acquiror (which date of hire
of any Hired Employee shall be the Closing Date unless such Hired Employee has
requested that such date of hire be a later date not more than two weeks from
the Closing Date), Hired Employees or Canadian Sales Force Employees who are
participants in the Elan 401(k) Savings Plan or a Canadian equivalent plan
(including a registered retirement savings plan) ("Elan's 401(k) Plan") shall
cease to be eligible for any future contributions to Elan's 401(k) Plan except
with respect to compensation from Elan Companies prior to the Closing Date and
as provided under Elan's 401(k) Plan, and shall be entitled to a distribution of
their account balances under Elan's 401(k) Plan in accordance with such plan and
as permitted by the Code. Hired Employees who receive an eligible rollover
distribution (within the meaning of Section 402(f)(2) of the Code, including a
direct rollover distribution with the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code)
from Elan's 401(k) Plan shall, subject to the provisions of Section 402 of the
Code, be permitted to make a rollover contribution to a defined contribution
plan of Acquiror ("Acquiror's Defined Contribution Plan"). Such rollover
contribution may not include promissory notes for loans made to Hired Employees
under the terms of Elan's 401(k) Plan.

            (d) For purposes of eligibility and vesting, Acquiror shall, with
respect to vacation and 401(k) plans or Canadian equivalent plan (including an
equivalent registered retirement savings plan) maintained by Acquiror after the
Closing Date (if applicable to the Hired Employee or Canadian Sales Force
Employee), credit each Hired Employee or Canadian Sales Force Employee with all
service credited to the employee under Elan Companies' corresponding plan,
policy, program or arrangement applicable to such employee as of the Closing
Date; provided, however, that there will be no duplication by Acquiror of any
benefits provided by Elan Companies.

            (e) Hired Employees who shall have accepted as of the Closing Date
employment with Acquiror shall be eligible to enroll in a health plan determined
by the Acquiror as of the Closing Date without (i) any waiting periods, (ii) any
evidence of insurability, (iii) application of any pre-existing physical or
mental condition restrictions, or (iv) deductibles or co-pays, except to the
ex-


                                      -50-

tent that such waiting periods, evidence of insurability, pre-existing mental or
physical condition restrictions, or deductibles or co-pays would apply under
EPI's Welfare Plans and be permitted by law. Elan Companies shall retain
responsibility for all payment of benefits under its medical benefit plan to
Hired Employees for claims incurred prior to the date of hire by Acquiror.
Acquiror shall be responsible for claims for medical benefits incurred on or
after the date of hire by Acquiror by Hired Employees under Acquiror's medical
benefit plan applicable to the Hired Employees. For purposes of the preceding
sentences, a claim shall be deemed to have been incurred on the date on which
medical or other treatment or service was rendered and not the date of inception
of the related illness or injury or the date of submission of a claim related
thereto. Acquiror's medical benefit plan shall provide that any medical expenses
incurred before the date of hire by Acquiror by a Hired Employee (and his or her
dependents) during the calendar year including the date of hire by Acquiror
shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the applicable
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions of the Acquiror's
medical benefit plan.

            (f) Acquiror and Elan Companies expressly acknowledge and agree that
Acquiror shall be obligated, in respect of any Hired Employee terminated by the
Acquiror (i) for any reason on or after the date of hire, to pay all
Liabilities, including any liability triggered under any severance plans,
programs and agreements of Acquiror relating to Hired Employees under statute or
common law ("Acquiror Severance"), any liability relating to the violation of
any anti-discrimination law, and any employment compensation or
government-mandated benefits relating to the termination of any Hired Employees
on or after the date of hire by Acquiror, including under the WARN Act, the
Employment Standards Act (Ontario) or the common law and (ii) without cause
between and including the date of hire and six months following the Closing
Date, to pay all Liabilities that the Elan Companies would have been required to
pay under the Elan U.S. Severance Plan had the Elan Companies retained such
Hired Employee on or after the Closing Date and terminated such Hired Employee
on the date terminated by the Acquiror; provided, however that (i) such Hired
Employee was an active employee of the Elan Companies on the date of hire by the
Acquiror, (ii) such Hired Employee's employment terminated because of death,
retirement, resignation or job abandonment and (iii) such Hired Employee
executes a valid waiver and release in substantially the same form as the Waiver
and Release Agreement (as defined in the Elan U.S. Severance Plan) which remains
unrevoked by such Hired Employee for the seven-day revocation period. Nothing in
this Section 8.10 shall be construed as limiting the Acquiror's right to
terminate any Hired Employee at any time, with or without cause. Elan Companies
shall have no liability or obligation with respect to Acquiror Severance for
Hired Employees.

            (g) Acquiror shall be responsible for all liabilities, obligations,
costs, claims, proceedings and demands, under the WARN Act, the Employment
Standards Act (Ontario), the common law or any state or provincial plant closing
or notification law, or similar law in other jurisdictions, arising out of, or
relating to, any actions taken by Acquiror or its Affiliates on or after the
date of hire by Acquiror or arising out of the fact that Acquiror does not offer
employment to certain Business Employees.

            (h) (i) Prior to the end of the one (1) year period following the
Closing, ECI shall provide appropriate notice in writing to its Canadian sales
force personnel for the Product ("Canadian Sales Force Employees") set forth on
Schedule 8.10(h) regarding the termination of their em-


                                      -51-
<PAGE>

ployment at the end of the one (1) year period. ECI shall provide the Canadian
Sales Force Employees with appropriate termination notice or pay in lieu of
notice, as required under the provisions of the Employment Standards Act, 2000
and any other notice or pay in lieu of notice as may be required at common law.
At the end of the one (1) year period, ECI will provide each member of the sales
force personnel with an appropriate record of employment. Elan Parent and its
Affiliates remain responsible regarding any and all liability, including
liability under the Ontario Employment Standards Act, 2000, the Human Rights
Code and at common law arising as a result of the employment of the Canadian
sales force personnel with Elan and its Affiliates and/or their termination.

            (ii) At or prior to the end of such one (1) year period, the
Acquiror shall offer employment to all the Canadian Sales Force Employees (or
such other employees who are ECI's Canadian sales force personnel for the
Product at the end of such period), up to a maximum of six (6) such individuals.
The Acquiror will offer employment to such persons at such compensation and on
such terms as the Acquiror deems appropriate and will provide each such hired
person with such benefits, holidays, vacation days, incentive pay and bonus
programs as the Acquiror deems appropriate; provided, however, that the total
cash compensation offered to such persons shall be no less than the total cash
compensation they are receiving from ECI as of the date of termination of their
employment by Elan, less any increases in such compensation during the
immediately preceding twelve (12) month period that are outside of the Ordinary
Course of Business. Elan Parent and its Affiliates will fully cooperate with the
Acquiror in its extension of such offers of employment and shall not prevent,
discourage or entice, directly or indirectly, any of the Canadian Sales Force
Employees to reject such offers of employment.

            Section 8.11. Bulk Transfer Laws. The Acquiror hereby waives
compliance by the Elan Companies and their respective Affiliates with the
provisions of any so-called "bulk transfer law" of any jurisdiction in
connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets to the Acquiror. The Elan
Companies will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Acquiror for any
Liabilities it suffers as a result of such "bulk transfer laws" or such waiver
in accordance with Section 11.02(a).

            Section 8.12. Covenant Not to Compete. (a) For the period from the
date hereof until ten (10) years following the Closing Date (the "Applicable
Period"), neither Parent nor any of their Subsidiaries, or its or their
respective successors or assigns or any of its or their respective agents acting
on their behalf, shall engage, license or assist another to engage in the
marketing, distribution or sale in the Territory, in the case of Elan Parent and
its Subsidiaries, or outside the Territory, in the case of the Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries, of any Product or Product Improvement (each, a "Competing
Product"). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if either Parent or any of
their Subsidiaries signs a definitive agreement with respect to a merger or
acquisition by which such Person would acquire rights (other than residual
financial rights) in a Competing Product at any time during the Applicable
Period, then such Person (or the entity which acquired such Person or into which
such Person has merged) shall have 12 months from the closing of such definitive
agreement to divest itself of such rights in the Competing Product (unless the
other Party agrees in writing that such divestiture is not required) and, during
such 12 month period, the manufacture, promotion, marketing and/or sale of such
Competing Product shall not be in violation of this Section 8.12. In the case of
divestiture under the preceding sentence, such divestiture can occur by either
(x) an outright sale of all rights in Competing Product to a third party, or (y)
an out-license to a third party (exclusive as to the applica-


                                      -52-
<PAGE>

ble Parent and its Subsidiaries, except that the applicable Parent and its
Subsidiaries may continue manufacturing the Competing Product for the licensee
for a reasonable period of time) of the right to make, have made, use, sell,
offer for sale and import such Competing Product; provided, however, that the
applicable Parent and its Subsidiaries may only retain residual financial rights
to such Competing Product and must not exercise or have the ability to exercise
any role or influence in any manner over the performance of any clinical trials
with respect to such Competing Product, or the sale, offering for sale or other
promotion of such Competing Product.

            (b) In addition, no Elan Company will solicit any Hired Employee of
the Acquiror or its Subsidiaries for the purpose of having any such employee
terminate his or her employment with the Acquiror or its Subsidiaries for a
period of two years following the Closing Date.

            (c) If a court determines that the foregoing restrictions are too
broad or otherwise unreasonable under applicable Law, including with respect to
time or space, the court is hereby requested and authorized by the parties to
revise the foregoing restriction to include the maximum restrictions allowable
under applicable Law. Each of the parties acknowledges, however, that this
Section 8.12 has been negotiated by the parties and that the geographical and
time limitations on activities, are reasonable in light of the circumstances
pertaining to the parties.

            (d) The terms of this Section 8.12 (subject to Section 8.12(f))
shall apply to each Parent's respective Affiliates to the same extent as if they
were parties hereto, and each Parent shall take whatever actions are within its
control to cause any such other Persons to adhere to the terms of this Section
8.12.

            (e) In the event of any breach or threatened breach by of any
provision of this Section 8.12, the other party shall be entitled to injunctive
or other equitable relief restraining such party from competing or soliciting in
violation of this Section. Such relief shall be in addition to and not in lieu
of any other remedies that may be available, including an action for the
recovery of Damages.

            (f) For the avoidance of doubt, if any Person acquires Control of
either Parent, whether by stock purchase, merger or other transaction, no
provision of this Section 8.12 shall apply to such acquiror and its Affiliates
other than such Parent and its Subsidiaries but this Section 8.12 shall continue
to apply to such Parent and its Subsidiaries; provided that such Parent and its
Subsidiaries may transfer drug delivery technologies or any other assets to such
acquiror even if such acquiror uses such assets in a Competing Product, so long
as the drug delivery technologies or other assets transferred by such Parent and
its Subsidiaries do not themselves comprise a Competing Product.

            Section 8.13. Oversight Committee. (a) Promptly after the Closing
Date, the parties shall form an oversight committee for the Product (the
"Oversight Committee"). The principal purpose of the Oversight Committee shall
be to: (i) create a forum enabling the parties to review and exchange
information with respect to Phase I through IV clinical trial strategies and
activities inside and outside of the Territory; (ii) review and share results
and data that may be obtained in clinical trials sponsored by either party;
(iii) review their respective development strategies and protocols for ongoing
and anticipated clinical studies; (iv) monitor each other's regulatory
strategies and activities


                                      -53-
<PAGE>

for the Product and create standard operating procedures regarding regulatory
compliance for the Product; (v) review each other's public data and reports
arising from and generated in connection with the commercialization of the
Product; (vi) review and coordinate the activities of each party in relation to
the manufacture and supply of key chemical components and the Product; (vii)
coordinate marketing activities with respect to the Product inside and outside
the Territory; (viii) keep each other informed of any issues or events which
impact or relate to the Product; (ix) provide a forum for resolving strategic
differences between the parties; and (x) have such other responsibilities as may
be mutually agreed upon by the parties from time to time.

            (b) In no event shall either party have any obligation to
participate in any clinical trial initiatives of the other party, or to modify
clinical trial initiatives in response to the other party, and any sharing of
costs for, or dedication of personnel to, any joint efforts shall require the
unanimous written approval of all members of the Oversight Committee, and any
proposal resulting from joint action made by either party that would result in
costs incurred by the other party shall be subject to prior written approval of
all members appointed by either party to the Oversight Committee.

            (c) The Oversight Committee shall be composed of four persons, with
each party being entitled to designate two individuals. The initial members
shall be designated by each party in writing promptly following execution of
this Agreement. Each party may change its designated members at any time upon
advance written notice to the other party. The Oversight Committee shall be
chaired by a representative of the Elan Companies during the twelve months
following the Closing Date and in each year thereafter the chairmanship shall
alternate between one of the Acquiror's representatives and one of the Elan
Companies' representatives.

            (d) The Oversight Committee shall meet as soon as practicable after
the Closing Date and upon either party's reasonable request thereafter, but in
any event at least twice per year. Unless otherwise agreed, all meetings shall
be conducted in the United States and shall alternate between the business
offices of each of the parties or, if mutually agreed, shall be conducted by
teleconference or video conference. Minutes for all such meetings shall be
prepared by a designated representative of one of the parties and shall be
subject to review and approval by the other party. All such minutes and any
other information presented or exchanged at such meetings shall be maintained as
Confidential Information of the disclosing party in accordance with the
provisions of Section 8.06 of this Agreement. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Section 8.13, decisions of the Oversight Committee shall be
made by a unanimous vote of a quorum of its members. A quorum shall require at
least one representative of each party. Each party shall bear the costs and
expenses of its designated members that are incurred in connection with the
Oversight Committee meetings.

            Section 8.14. Medical Inquiries and Complaints. The parties will
negotiate in good faith to jointly develop written procedures for the
administration of, and response to, medical inquiries or complaints concerning
the Product by consumers, physicians, pharmacists and other health care
professionals, as soon as practicable, but such written procedures shall be in
place no later than 30 days after the Closing Date. Each party shall use
commercially reasonably efforts to comply with the provisions thereof with
respect to the Product. Notwithstanding the foregoing or the joint written
procedures, the Acquiror shall exclusively have the right to determine how to
respond to medical in-


                                      -54-
<PAGE>

quiries and complaints in the Territory and Elan Companies shall have such
exclusive right outside the Territory.

            Section 8.15. Insurance. (a) From the date of this Agreement until
the Closing Date, the Elan Companies shall keep the Plant adequately insured at
all times by financially sound and reputable insurers and maintain such other
insurance, to such extent and against such risks, including fire and other risks
insured against by extended coverage, as is customary with companies in the same
or similar businesses operating in the same or similar locations.

            (b) For so long as each party distributes any Product in or outside
of the Territory and for five years thereafter, such party shall maintain at its
sole cost and expense, product liability insurance (including any self-insured
arrangements) in amounts and with deductibles that are reasonable and customary
in the pharmaceutical industry for companies of comparable size and activities
in the relevant country. Such product liability insurance or self-insured
arrangements shall insure against all liability, including without limitation
personal injury, physical injury, or property damage arising out of the
manufacture, sale, distribution, or marketing of the Product. Each party shall
provide written proof of the existence of such insurance to the other party upon
request.

            Section 8.16. Further Assurances. (a) On and after the Closing Date,
the Elan Companies shall from time to time, at the request of the Acquiror,
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such other
instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such other actions as the
Acquiror may reasonably request, in order to more effectively consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and to vest in the Acquiror good and marketable
title to the Purchased Assets (including assistance in the collection or
reduction to possession of any of the Purchased Assets).

            (b) On and after the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall from time to
time, at the request of the Elan Companies, take such actions as the Elan
Companies may reasonably request, in order to more effectively consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Acquiror's assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities.

            Section 8.17. No Solicitation. From and after the date hereof and up
to and including the Termination Date without the prior written consent of the
Acquiror, no Elan Company will authorize or permit any representative or
employee of any Elan Company to (i) directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action
to facilitate knowingly any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal
from any Person, (ii) engage in any discussion or negotiations relating thereto
or (iii) accept any Acquisition Proposal. If any Elan Company receives any such
inquiries, offers or proposals it shall promptly notify the Acquiror orally and
in writing of such event. As used herein, "Acquisition Proposal" means any
proposal or offer (other than pursuant to this Agreement) to acquire in any
manner an ownership interest in any part of the Business, Product or Plant.

            Section 8.18. Incentive Compensation. Any bonus or other incentive
compensation due any employee or consultant of the Business as of the Closing
Date, as a result of the transactions


                                      -55-
<PAGE>

contemplated hereby or otherwise, shall be paid by the applicable Elan Company
to such Persons immediately prior to the Closing Date.

            Section 8.19. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Elan Companies shall pay all of the legal, accounting, finders and bankers fees
and other expenses incurred by any Elan Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Acquiror shall pay all of the legal,
accounting, finders and bankers fees and other expenses incurred by the Acquiror
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

            Section 8.20. HSR Act and Irish Mergers Act Filings. (a) The
Acquiror and the Elan Companies shall each: (i) take promptly all actions
necessary to make the filing required of such party or any of its Affiliates
under the HSR Act and Irish Mergers Act within five Business Days after the date
hereof, (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request for
additional information or documentary material received by such party or any of
its Affiliates from the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR Act and from equivalent Irish
Governmental or Regulatory Authorities pursuant to the Irish Mergers Act and
(iii) cooperate with the other parties in connection with any filing under the
HSR Act and Irish Mergers Act and in connection with resolving any investigation
or other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
commenced by either the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice or state attorneys general or any equivalent Irish
Governmental or Regulatory Authority. Each of the Elan Companies, on one hand,
and the Acquiror, on the other hand, shall be responsible for its own legal fees
for preparing its portion of the HSR Act and Irish Mergers Act filings.

            (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other covenants of
the parties contained herein, each party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby under any antitrust
Law. If any administrative, judicial or legislative Action or Proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the sale and purchase of
any of the Purchased Assets or any other transaction as violative of any
antitrust Law, each party shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable
efforts vigorously to contest and resist any such Action or Proceeding, and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other Order that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits
consummation of the sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets or any other
transaction contemplated under this Agreement.

            (c) Each party shall promptly inform the other parties of any
material communication received by such party from the Federal Trade Commission,
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any other Governmental or
Regulatory Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement. Each party shall advise the other parties promptly of any
understandings, undertakings or agreements that such party proposes to make or
enter into with the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice or any other Governmental or Regulatory Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

            Section 8.21. Indiana Disclosure Document. Prior to the Closing
Date, the Elan Companies agree to undertake all activities necessary to comply
with Indiana's Responsible Property Transfer Law, Ind. Code 13-25-3-1, and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, including the delivery by the Elan Companies
to the Acquiror at least seven days prior to the Closing Date, unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by Acquiror, of a disclosure document that is in the form
set forth in Section 7 of the Indiana Responsible Property Transfer Law, Ind.
Code 13-25-3-7, and which provides the information elicited on such form
(hereinafter, the "Indiana Disclosure Document"). The Elan Companies shall
assume sole responsibility, including all costs and expenses related thereto,
for (i) recording the Indiana Disclosure Document in the office of the county
recorder of the county in which the Plant is located and (ii) filing a copy of
the Indiana Disclosure Document with the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management. The Elan Companies shall provide Acquiror with proof of such
recording and filing.

            Section 8.22. Rights In Japan. If and when the Pre-Conditions of
Transfer are satisfied, the Elan Companies covenant that they and their
Affiliates shall transfer to the Acquiror their entire right, title and interest
in and to, and their rights to make, have made, sell, offer to sell, use, and
import, the Product, Current Product Improvements or Product Improvements in
Japan (the "Japanese Rights"). The Acquiror acknowledges and covenants that (i)
any transfer is and shall be on an "as is" basis; (ii) the Elan Companies make
no representations and warranties of any kind with respect to any transfer
arising out of this Section 8.22; (iii) the Acquiror, in the event the
Pre-Conditions of Transfer are met and the transfer of the Japanese Rights
occurs, shall bear, and shall hold the Elan Companies and their Affiliates
harmless for, any costs and expenses arising out of the Acquiror's obtaining the
equivalent of Product Registrations in Japan for the use, manufacture,
marketing, selling, distribution or commercialization of the Product, Current
Product Improvements or Product Improvements in Japan; and (iv) the failure of
the parties to consummate the transfer shall not be a basis for reduction of the
Purchase Price or create any right of the Acquiror to seek damages, offset any
amounts against the Purchase Price or seek any indemnification under the
provisions of Article XI. Any transfer shall be effectuated and documented by
the execution of written agreements customary for such transfers, provided,
however, that such documentation shall among other provisions contain
intellectual property and non-compete provisions consistent with this Agreement
and shall not contain provisions inconsistent with the requirements of this
Section 8.22. The term "Pre-Conditions of Transfer" shall mean that the Elan
Companies have the authority to undertake the transfer of rights, title and
interest contemplated by this Section 8.22 without breaching any contractual
obligation to a Third Party existing as of the date hereof (provided that the
Elan Companies and their Affiliates shall exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly satisfy the Pre-Conditions of Transfer) and that such
transfer can be undertaken without the Elan Companies or their Affiliates
incurring a material and adverse financial cost unless the Acquiror undertakes
to, and promptly does, reimburse such cost. In the event the Pre-Conditions of
Transfer are satisfied or can be satisfied by such date, the Elan Companies and
the Acquiror covenant to complete and close any transfer within ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date; provided that if such closing shall not have occurred
within such period, either party shall have the option to extend this period for
four successive 90-day periods, and in any event during such periods or
thereafter the Elan Companies and their Affiliates shall not transfer the
Japanese Rights to any other Person.

            Section 8.23. Construction of Certain Provisions. To the extent that
any provision of any Related Agreement is inconsistent with any provision of
Sections 8.05, 8.06 or 8.09, such provision of such Related Agreement shall
govern and shall supersede such provision of Section 8.05, 8.06 or 8.09, as the
case may be, to the extent so inconsistent.

Assets illegal or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of such purchase and
sale. The parties shall have received any clearance that may be required under
the HSR Act and the Irish Mergers Act.

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

            Section 11.01. Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants,
Etc. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Elan
Companies or the Acquiror contained in this Agreement and the Related Agreements
(other than the Supply Agreement) shall survive the Closing Date and remain in
full force and effect thereafter until December 31, 2003 (the "Expiration
Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, however:

            (a) any claim with respect to a breach of Section 6.09 shall not
      expire until December 31, 2004;

            (b) any claim with respect to a breach of a representation or
      warranty relating to title to the Product Intellectual Property, Product
      Registrations and the Plant shall not expire until December 31, 2005; and

            (c) any claim based upon a breach of a covenant or an agreement
      contained in this Agreement or any Related Agreement to be performed after
      the Closing Date (except the Supply Agreements) which shall not expire and
      shall continue in perpetuity.

            So long as an Indemnified Party gives an Indemnification Claim
Notice for a claim on or before the Expiration Date or the applicable date set
forth in Section 11.01(a)-(c), such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
pursue its rights to indemnification. Indemnification pursuant to Section 11.02
shall be the exclusive contract right and remedy for damages of the Indemnified
Parties for any losses arising under this Agreement or Related Agreements based
upon breach of representation or warranty or upon a claim under Section
11.02(a)(iii) hereof.

            Section 11.02. Indemnification.

            (a) By the Elan Companies. Subject to Sections 11.01 and 11.03, from
and after the Closing, the Elan Companies shall jointly and severally indemnify,
reimburse, defend and hold harmless the Acquiror, its Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns from
and against any and all costs, losses, damages, including natural resource
damages, fines, penalties, judgments, lawsuits, deficiencies, claims and
expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys and other
professionals, including third-party consultants and, to the extent allowable at
Law, medical monitoring costs and expenses) of every kind and nature incurred
(collectively, the "Damages") arising out of, resulting from or incident to (i)
any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of an Elan
Company made in this Agreement or the Related Agreements (except Section 6.09),
(ii) any Excluded Liabilities (except Environmental Damages), and (iii) any
Damages arising under any Environmental Law ("Environmental Damages") based on
any of the following occurring on or prior to the Closing Date: (A) the
presence, Release or threatened Release of Hazardous Materials at, from, in, to,
on or under any Site; (B) any violation of an Environmental Law in connection
with the Product, the Purchased Assets or the operation of the Plant; (C) the
transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of Hazardous Materials by or on
behalf of


                                      -60-
<PAGE>

the Elan Companies, any predecessors or affiliates of the Elan Companies or any
entities previously owned by the Elan Companies in connection with the Product,
the Purchased Assets or the operations of the Plant; (D) a breach of a
representation or warranty in Section 6.09; or (E) the items listed on Schedule
11.02(a)(iii)(E), in each case to the extent incurred for actions (conducted in
a commercially reasonable manner) required by applicable Environmental Laws for
the existing use of the property or asset involved and based on a claim
(including a notice of violation) asserted by a third party, including a
Governmental or Regulatory Authority, and only to the extent any Environmental
Damages are not attributable to the acts or omissions of an Indemnified Party,
including without limitation, the conduct of any soil, surface water or
groundwater investigation not required to be undertaken by applicable
Environmental Laws; provided, that indemnification under this Section
11.02(a)(iii) for Environmental Damages shall be the exclusive remedy available
to any Indemnified Party and all other statutory or other rights to recover any
Environmental Damages shall hereby be waived. The requirement for a third-party
claim shall not apply to actions required under applicable Environmental Laws to
cure any non-compliance for the items on Schedule 11.02(a)(iii)(E). After the
Closing Date, the Acquiror shall have the right to control the conduct of such
actions relating to such matters set forth on Schedule 11.02(a)(iii)(E) to the
extent permitted by Law, including negotiation with governmental regulators,
subject to prior approval by the Elan Companies (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld); any expenses incurred by Acquiror with respect to such
actions for which indemnification will be sought shall be subject to the prior
approval of the Elan Companies, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, except to the extent that the Acquiror is required to take
immediate action pursuant to applicable Environmental Laws by a Governmental or
Regulatory Authority.

            (b) By the Acquiror. Subject to Sections 11.01 and 11.03, from and
after the Closing, the Acquiror shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Elan Company, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all Damages
incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting from or incident to (i)
any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Acquiror
made in this Agreement or the Related Agreements, (ii) the use by the Acquiror
and its Affiliates of the Marketing Materials or (iii) any Assumed Liabilities.

            (c) Procedure for Claims. The indemnified party shall give the
indemnifying party prompt written notice (an "Indemnification Claim Notice") of
any Damages or discovery of fact upon which such indemnified party intends to
base a request for indemnification under Section 11.02(a) or Section 11.02(b).
Failure to give any such notice shall not constitute a waiver of any right to
indemnification or reduce in any way the indemnification available hereunder,
except to the extent such failure to notify directly increases the amount to be
indemnified hereunder. Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a
description of the claim and the nature and amount of such Damages (to the
extent that the nature and amount of such Damages are known at such time). The
indemnified party shall furnish promptly to the indemnifying party copies of all
papers and official documents received in respect of any Damages. All
indemnification claims in respect of a party, its Affiliates or their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "Indemnitees" and
each an "Indemnitee") shall be made solely by such party to this Agreement (the
"Indemnified Party").


                                      -61-
<PAGE>

            (d) Third Party Claims. The obligations of an indemnifying party
under this Section 11.02 with respect to Damages arising from claims of any
third party that are subject to indemnification as provided for in Section
11.02(a) or Section 11.02(b) (a "Third Party Claim") shall be governed by and be
contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions:

            (i) At its option, the indemnifying party may assume the defense of
      any Third Party Claim by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party
      within thirty (30) days after the indemnifying party's receipt of an
      Indemnification Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of a Third
      Party Claim by the indemnifying party shall not be construed as an
      acknowledgment that the indemnifying party is liable to indemnify any
      Indemnitee in respect of the Third Party Claim, nor shall it constitute a
      waiver by the indemnifying party of any defenses it may assert against any
      Indemnitee's claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a
      Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party may appoint as lead counsel in
      the defense of the Third Party Claim any legal counsel selected by the
      indemnifying party, provided that in the event that a conflict of interest
      arises between the indemnifying party and its Indemnified Party such that
      such legal counsel cannot represent both the indemnifying party and the
      Indemnified Party, the Indemnitee may retain its own legal counsel at the
      expense of the indemnifying party and the indemnifying party and its
      counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party and its counsel, as may
      be reasonably requested. In the event the indemnifying party assumes the
      defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall immediately
      deliver to the indemnifying party all original notices and documents
      (including court papers) received by any Indemnitee in connection with the
      Third Party Claim. Except as set forth above, should the indemnifying
      party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party
      shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party or any other Indemnitee for
      any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party or
      other Indemnitee in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of
      the Third Party Claim.

            (ii) Without limiting Section 11.02(d)(i), any Indemnitee shall be
      entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third
      Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose;
      provided, however, that such employment shall be at the Indemnitee's own
      expense, except as described above, unless (A) the employment thereof has
      been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party in writing, or (B)
      the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel
      in accordance with Section 11.02(d)(i) (in which case the Indemnified
      Party shall control the defense).

            (iii) With respect to any Damages relating solely to the payment of
      money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that will not
      result in the Indemnitee's or the Indemnified Party's becoming subject to
      injunctive or other relief or otherwise adversely affect the business or
      reputation of the Indemnitee or the Indemnified Party in any manner, and
      as to which the indemnifying party shall have acknowledged in writing the
      obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder, the indemnifying party
      shall have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter
      into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Damages, on such terms as
      the indemnifying party, in its sole discretion, shall deem appropriate,
      provided that, as a result of or in connection with any such settlement
      each Indemnitee or Indemnified Party shall receive a full release with
      respect to such claim. With respect to all other


                                      -62-
<PAGE>

      Damages in connection with Third Party Claims, where the indemnifying
      party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with
      Section 11.02(d)(i), the indemnifying party shall have authority to
      consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or
      otherwise dispose of such Damages; provided that it obtains the prior
      written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
      unreasonably withheld or delayed). The indemnifying party shall not be
      liable for any settlement or other disposition of Damages by an Indemnitee
      or Indemnified Party that is reached without the written consent of the
      indemnifying party. Regardless of whether the indemnifying party chooses
      to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, no Indemnitee or Indemnified
      Party shall admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
      discharge, any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
      indemnifying party.

            (iv) Regardless of whether the indemnifying party chooses to defend
      or prosecute any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party and each
      indemnifying party shall, and shall cause each other Indemnitee or
      Affiliate of any such indemnifying party, as applicable, to, cooperate in
      the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records,
      information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such
      conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
      reasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall
      include access during normal business hours afforded to the indemnifying
      party or Indemnified Party, as applicable, to, and reasonable retention by
      each such Person of, records and information that are reasonably relevant
      to such Third Party Claim, and making each such Person and other employees
      and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
      information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the
      indemnifying party shall reimburse each such Person for all its reasonable
      out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith.

            (e) Effect of Investigation or Knowledge. Any claim by the Acquiror
or its Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
agents for indemnification shall not be adversely affected by any investigation
by or opportunity to investigate afforded to the Acquiror, nor shall such a
claim be adversely affected by the Acquiror's Knowledge on or before the Closing
Date of any breach of the type specified in this Section 11.02 or of any state
of facts that may give rise to such a breach. The waiver of any condition based
on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not adversely affect the right
to indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations.

            Section 11.03. Limitations. (a) In no event shall the Elan Companies
or the Acquiror be liable for any Damages pursuant to a claim based upon a
representation or warranty and pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(i) or 11.02(b)(i) or
for Environmental Damages pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(iii), as applicable,
unless and until (i) the individual claim giving rise to any Damages exceeds
$25,000, in which case the Elan Companies or the Acquiror, as applicable, shall
be liable for all Damages arising from such claim, (ii) except for claims
pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(iii)(E), the aggregate amount of all such Damages
exceeds $2.5 million, in which case the Elan Companies or the Acquiror, as
applicable, shall be liable for all such Damages only in excess of such amount,
and then (iii) not for any amount in excess of $75 million for all claims made
under such Sections 11.02(a)(i)


                                      -63-
<PAGE>

or 11.02(b)(i) and for all claims made under Section 11.02(a)(iii) except claims
made under Section 11.02(a)(iii)(E), as applicable, in the aggregate.

            (b) The amount of any Damages recoverable by a party under Section
11.02 shall be reduced by (i) the amount of any actual Tax benefits received by
the Indemnified Party within three years from the Closing Date that result from
the Liability that gave rise to such indemnity and (ii) the amount of any
insurance proceeds paid to the indemnified party relating to such claim.

            (c) THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL NOT
EXTEND TO SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION OR LOST PROFITS, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                           TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

            Section 12.01. Methods of Termination. Prior to the Closing, the
transactions contemplated herein may be terminated and/or abandoned at any time:

            (a) by mutual written agreement of the Elan Companies and the
      Acquiror;

            (b) by the Elan Companies if the Closing shall not have occurred by
      December 15, 2002 (the "Termination Date"); provided, that the right to
      terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.01(b) shall not be
      available to the Elan Companies, if their failure to perform in all
      material respects any of their obligations under this Agreement or any
      Related Agreement results in the failure of the Closing to occur by such
      time;

            (c) by the Acquiror if the Closing shall not have occurred by the
      Termination Date; provided, that the right to terminate the Agreement
      pursuant to this Section 12.01(c) shall not be available to the Acquiror
      if its failure to perform in all material respects any of its obligations
      under this Agreement or any Related Agreement results in the failure of
      the Closing to occur by such time; provided, further, that if the sole
      reason that the Closing has not occurred by the Termination Date is that
      the Elan Companies have failed to obtain all Elan Third Party Consents,
      then the Elan Companies may, by written notice to Acquiror, request
      extension of such termination date one or more times but in no event may
      Elan Companies extend this termination date beyond January 31, 2003;

            (d) by either the Elan Companies or the Acquiror if there shall be
      in effect any Law that prohibits the Closing or if the Closing would
      violate any non-appealable Order;

            (e) by either the Elan Companies or the Acquiror if the other party
      has breached any material obligation hereunder that remains uncured for a
      period of 30 days, unless such breach is not capable of cure, in which
      event the non-breaching party may terminate immediately;


                                      -64-
<PAGE>

            (f) by the Elan Companies, for any breach by the Acquiror of Section
      7.07;

            (g) by either the Elan Companies or the Acquiror if the shareholders
      of Elan Parent shall have rejected the proposal to approve the
      transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements at
      the Elan Shareholder Meeting; or

            (h) by the Acquiror if there is any material breach by the Elan
      Companies of the obligations set forth in Section 8.17 or if the Elan
      Parent board of directors withdraws its recommendation of this Agreement
      or the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Related Agreements.

            Section 12.02. Procedure upon Termination. In the event of
termination and abandonment under Section 12.01, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other party, and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be terminated and abandoned, without further action by the
parties hereto. If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
terminated and/or abandoned as provided herein:

            (a) each party, if requested, will redeliver all documents, work
      papers and other material of the other party and its Affiliates relating
      to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or
      after the execution hereof, to the party furnishing the same; and

            (b) no party hereto and none of their respective directors,
      officers, stockholders, Affiliates or Controlling Persons shall have any
      further liability or obligation to any other party to this Agreement,
      except that (i) nothing in this Section 12.02 shall prejudice any rights,
      claims, or causes of action that may have accrued hereunder or with
      respect hereto prior to the date of such termination, including for breach
      of this Agreement (whether based upon the termination or otherwise) and
      (ii) the provisions of Article XIII shall survive any termination of this
      Agreement.

            Section 12.03. Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge that
the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and specifically identifiable.
Accordingly, the parties further agree and stipulate that, if the Closing does
not occur because of the willful failure of the Elan Companies, on the one hand,
or the Acquiror, on the other hand, to perform their respective obligations
hereunder, (a) monetary damages and any other remedy at law will not be
adequate, (b) the non-defaulting party shall be entitled to specific performance
as the remedy for such breach, (c) each party agrees to waive any objection to
the remedy of specific performance, (d) each party agrees that the granting of
specific performance by any court will not be deemed to be harsh or oppressive
to the party who is ordered specifically to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and (e) in connection with any action for specific performance, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs
of prosecuting or defending such action.

            Section 12.04. Other Remedies. The right to seek specific
performance hereunder shall not preclude any party to seek any other remedy at
law or in equity.

            Section 12.05. Effect of Certain Terminations. In the event that (1)
this Agreement is terminated by (i) the Elan Companies pursuant to Section
12.01(b), (ii) the Acquiror pursuant to Section 12.01(e), or (iii) either the
Elan Companies or the Acquiror pursuant to Section 12.01(g) or (h) and (2) the
Elan Companies or their Affiliates shall have entered into a definitive
agreement regarding a transaction with a party unaffiliated with the Acquiror
involving a sale of the Business (whether alone or together with other assets of
the Elan Companies) within 12 months of the date of termination of this
Agreement, then the Elan Companies shall, as a condition to the consummation of
such transaction contemplated by Section 12.05(2), pay Acquiror or its designee
a fee equal to $18 million (the "Termination Fee"), payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in United States dollars.

fully severable, (ii) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
(iii) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and
effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision or by its severance herefrom, and (iv) in lieu of such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part
of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar to the

reasonably acceptable to the parties herein.
