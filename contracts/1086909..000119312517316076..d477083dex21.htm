accordance with the terms of this Section 1.8(a)(iv) (the " _Unvested Cash
(PSUs)_ " and, together with the Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs), the " _Unvested
Cash_ "). 

(v) _Payment of Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) and Unvested Cash (PSUs)_. 

 



11  The cash payment pursuant to (i) Section 1.8(a)(iii) for Unvested Company
Options and Unvested Company RSUs shall be subject to the same restrictions
and vesting arrangements (including all provisions with respect to the
acceleration of vesting following the Effective Date that would apply if such
awards were assumed by Parent, including pursuant to applicable Employment
Offer Documents) that were applicable to such Unvested Company Options or
Unvested Company RSUs, and (ii) Section 1.8(a)(iv) in exchange for Company
PSUs shall be subject to the same restrictions and service-based vesting
arrangements (including all provisions with respect to the acceleration of
vesting following the Effective Date, including pursuant to applicable
Employment Offer Documents, and assuming conversion of performance-based
vesting to service-based vesting as provided in Schedule 1.8(a)(iv) of the
Company Disclosure Letter) that were applicable to such Company PSUs, in each
case as of the Effective Time by virtue of Section 1.8(a)(iii) and Section
1.8(a)(iv) as applicable. Therefore, the Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) and
Unvested Cash (PSUs) shall not be payable by Parent at the Effective Time,
and shall instead become payable by Parent on the date that such Unvested
Company Options, Unvested Company RSU or Company PSUs would have become vested
under the vesting schedule in place for such awards at the Effective Time
(subject to the restrictions and other terms of such vesting schedule and
giving effect to all applicable terms with respect to the acceleration of
vesting and any applicable Employment Offer Document); _provided_ that
if such vesting conditions and terms are not satisfied and vesting ceases at
any point after the Effective Time (after giving effect to any applicable
terms of acceleration), no further cash payments will be made with respect to
Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) and Unvested Cash (PSUs). Parent shall make, or
in its discretion shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make, all such
required payments to holders of Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) and Unvested Cash
(PSUs) no later than the earlier of (A) the 15th day of the calendar month
immediately following the calendar month in which the corresponding Unvested
Company Option, Unvested Company RSU and Company PSUs would have become vested
under the service-based vesting schedule in place for such awards at the
Effective Time and (B) the end of the calendar year in which the corresponding
Unvested Company Option, Unvested Company RSU or Company PSUs, would have
become vested (subject to the restrictions and other terms of such service-
based vesting schedule and giving effect to the applicable terms with respect
to all acceleration of vesting and any applicable Employment Offer Documents);
_provided_ that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from such Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) and Unvested
Cash (PSUs) the required amount of withholding for Taxes pursuant to Section
1.12. The Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(iii)
and Unvested Cash (PSUs) payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(iv) on a given
payment date shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after
aggregating Cash-out Amounts for all Unvested Company Options, Unvested
Company RSUs and Company PSUs represented by a particular grant previously
held by such Person that would have vested on the relevant vesting date. All
amounts payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(iii) and Section 1.8(a)(iv) shall
be paid without interest. No Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) or Unvested Cash
(PSUs), or right thereto, may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or
transferred (including any transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other
than Parent, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in
satisfaction of any Liability of such Person, prior to the distribution to
such Person of such Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) and Unvested Cash (PSUs) in
accordance with this Agreement.

 

(b) _Capital Stock of Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of capital stock
of Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of the
sole stockholder of Sub, be converted into and become one share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation (and the shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Sub capital stock are so
converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving Corporations capital
stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective 

 



12  Time). The certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Sub common stock
will evidence ownership of the same number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) _Cancellation of Company Capital Stock Owned by the Company and Parent_.
At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by
the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
each share of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or subsidiary of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled without any
conversion thereof.

(d) _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company
Capital Stock occurring after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective
Time, all references in this Agreement to specified numbers of shares of any
class or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that are
based upon numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading prices
therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent
necessary to provide the parties hereto the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change.

(e) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if
any stockholder of the Company that is entitled to assert appraisal rights
properly demands to be paid the "fair value" of such holders shares of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with Delaware Law and complies with all
conditions and obligations of Section 262 thereof, meaning such perfected
appraisal rights are not effectively withdrawn or lost, each Dissenting Share
held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall not be converted at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the applicable portion of the consideration
payable in the Merger, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are
granted by Delaware Law to a holder of Dissenting Shares. The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any such demands received by the
Company, including any stockholders notice of their intent to demand payment
pursuant to Delaware Law that the Company receives prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company, and (ii) the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands under Delaware Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand in
respect of any Dissenting Shares. If, after the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost the right to seek appraisal rights, the Dissenting Shares
held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall immediately be converted into the
right to receive the cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a) in respect of
such shares as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares, and Parent
shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof at (or as promptly as reasonably
practicable after) the applicable time or times specified in Section 1.9(c),
following the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section
1.9(c), the amount of cash to which such holder would be entitled in respect
thereof under Section 1.8(a) as if such shares never had been Dissenting
Shares (and all such cash shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement
to have become deliverable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.8(a)).

 

1.9. _Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Parents transfer agent, Computershare Inc. (or such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent), shall act as exchange
agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") in the Merger.

(b) _Parent to Deposit Cash_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall,
or shall

 



13  cause a direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent to, deposit with the
Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I the cash payable
pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(i) and Section 1.8(a)(ii) (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, excludes the Unvested Cash) ( _provided_ that the cash
payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(ii) in respect of Vested Company Options,
Vested Company RSUs or Vested Company PSUs, in each case to be received by
the holder in the holders capacity as an employee of the Company or the
Subsidiaries for applicable employment Tax purposes, may instead be paid
directly by either Parent through its payroll provider or, if so directed by
Parent, by the Surviving Corporation through its payroll provider).

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates (" _Certificates_ ") and each holder of record of
book-entry shares (" _Uncertificated Shares_ ") that, in each case,
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Capital Stock, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use of such letter of transmittal
in effecting surrender of Certificates and/or Uncertificated Shares in
exchange for the cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a). Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, or upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of an appropriate
agents message in the case of book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares,
each holder of such Certificate or such Uncertificated Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check for the cash amount that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.8(a) in respect of the
Company Capital Stock represented by such Certificate or such Uncertificated
Shares (which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes any Unvested Cash), and
the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate
purposes, to evidence only the right to receive cash pursuant to Section
1.8(a), except as provided in Section 1.8(e).

(d) _No Interest_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash payable
pursuant to Section 1.8(a) or otherwise in connection with the Merger.

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amount payable pursuant to Section
1.8(a) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person to which the
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of the payment thereof that
the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall, as applicable,
be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of cash in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares surrendered, or established to the
satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.9, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto
shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Applicable Legal Requirement.

(g) _Unclaimed Cash_. Any portion of funds held by the Exchange Agent that has
not been delivered to any holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to this Article I within 12 months after the Effective Time shall
promptly be paid to Parent, and thereafter each holder of a

 



14  Certificate or Uncertificated Shares who has not theretofore complied with
the exchange procedures set forth in and contemplated by Section 1.9(c) shall
look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar laws)
for its claim, only as a general unsecured creditor thereof, to the cash
payable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.8(a). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, if any Certificate or Uncertificated Shares have not
been surrendered prior to the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which the merger consideration
contemplated by Section 1.8(a) in respect of such Certificate
or Uncertificated Shares would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity), any amounts payable in respect of such Certificate
or Uncertificated Shares shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Legal
Requirements, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

1.10. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. All cash paid
or payable following the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital
Stock in accordance with this Agreement shall be so paid or payable in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital
Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, such Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

 

1.11. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such Certificate, following the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the record holder thereof, such cash as may be required pursuant to
Section 1.8(a) in respect of such Certificate; _provided_ that Parent or the
Exchange Agent may, in its respective reasonable discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the record holder of such
Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as Parent or the Exchange Agent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent and/or any of their
respective Representatives with respect to such Certificate.

 

1.12. _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, their
respective subsidiaries and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the cash otherwise deliverable under this Agreement and from
any other payments otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, to any
holder of any shares of Company Capital Stock, any Company Options, any
Company RSUs, any Company PSUs, any Certificates or any Uncertificated Shares
such amounts as any of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, their respective
subsidiaries or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to any such deliveries and payments under the Code or any other
Applicable Legal Requirements. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
paid over to or credited by the relevant Tax Authority in accordance with
Applicable Legal Requirements, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to such holders
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

1.13. _Tax Consequences_. The parties hereto intend the Merger to be a taxable
sale of the Company Capital Stock by the Companys stockholders. Parent makes
no representations or warranties to the Company or to any holder of Company
Capital Stock, Company Options, Company RSUs or Company PSUs regarding the Tax
treatment of the Merger, or any Tax consequences to the Company or any such
holder arising in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions or agreements contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
acknowledges that the Company and such holders are relying solely on their own
Tax advisors in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions and agreements contemplated by this Agreement.

under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization or formation (except, in
the case of good standing, (i) any jurisdiction that does not recognize such
concept and (ii) where the failure to be in good standing in any jurisdiction

Material Adverse Effect). The Company and each Subsidiary has the corporate
or other applicable power to own its properties and to conduct the Business

the Company or a Subsidiary) in an amount in excess of $500,000 in respect of
any single Person.

(a) The Company has the corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and, subject to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, to
consummate the Merger and the other Transactions. The execution and delivery

the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by each of the other
parties hereto, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject only to
the effect, if any, of (i) applicable bankruptcy and other similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally and (ii) Applicable Legal
Requirements governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other
equitable remedies (collectively, the " _Enforceability Limitations_ "). The

rescinded in a manner adverse to Parent), has (i) approved this Agreement and
the Merger, (ii) determined that the Merger and the terms and conditions of
this Agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company
and the Companys stockholders and (iii) directed that the adoption of this
Agreement be submitted to the Companys stockholders for consideration and

Subject to the accuracy of the representation set forth in Section 3.4, the
affirmative vote of the Companys stockholders holding a majority of all
shares

 



18  of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding on the record date set for
the determination of stockholders entitled to vote on such matter at the
Company Stockholder Meeting (such affirmative vote, the " _Company
Stockholder Approval_ ") is the only vote of the Companys stockholders
necessary to adopt this Agreement under Applicable Legal Requirements and the
Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions will not, (i)
result in the creation of any Encumbrance on any of the material properties or
assets of the Company and any Subsidiary, taken as a whole, or (ii) conflict
with, or result in any violation of or default under (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both), or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any material benefit
under, or require any consent, approval or waiver from any Person pursuant
to, (A) any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other
equivalent organizational or governing documents of the Company or any
Subsidiary, in each case as amended to date, (B) subject to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval and compliance with the requirements set forth
in Section 2.3(c), any Applicable Legal Requirement, or (C) any Material
Contract, other than, in the case of clause (B) of this Section 2.3(b), such
conflicts, violations, defaults, Encumbrances, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations, losses, consents, approvals or waivers as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

made, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(d) Subject to the accuracy of the representation set forth in Section 3.4,
the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions referred to in Section
2.3(a) by the Company Board constitute all of the approvals that are necessary
to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions the restrictions on "business combinations" with "interested
stockholders" set forth in Section 203 of Delaware Law (as such terms are
defined therein), and represent the only action necessary to ensure that the
restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of Delaware
Law does not and will not apply to the execution, delivery or performance of

Subsidiary or their respective internal accounting controls or any material
inaccuracy in the Companys Financial Statements, or any material complaint,

advertising or disposition of any Company-Owned Intellectual Property by the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries, except as would not, individually or in

unauthorized disclosure, infringement or misappropriation of any Company-
Owned Intellectual Property by any third party. Since January 1, 2014, neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has brought any Legal Proceeding

 



26  for infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property Right or
breach of any Company Intellectual Property Agreement.

 

(h) Since January 1, 2014, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has been
sued in any Legal Proceeding (or received any written notice or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threat) that involves a claim of infringement or
misappropriation of any Intellectual Property Right of any third party or that
contests the validity, ownership or right of the Company or any Subsidiary
to exercise any Company-Owned Intellectual Property. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has received any written communication since January 1, 2014
that alleges that any Company Products or the conduct of the Business
infringes any Intellectual Property Rights of any third party, or includes

Intellectual Property Right of a third party in connection with an allegation
that any Company Products or the conduct of the Business infringes any
Intellectual Property Rights of such third party.

(i) Since January 1, 2014, there has been no Order binding upon the Company
or any Subsidiary for material Liability for infringement of any Third Party
Intellectual Property or for unfair competition or unfair trade practices. To
the knowledge of the Company, the operation of the Business, including the
(i) design, development, manufacturing, marketing, licensing, sale, use and/or
distribution of any Company Product and (ii) the Companys or any Subsidiarys
use of any product, device or process in the Company Products does not and
(when conducted in substantially the same manner following the Closing) will
not infringe or misappropriate any Third-Party Intellectual Property, or
constitute unfair competition or unfair trade practices under the
applicable law of any jurisdiction in which the Company or any Subsidiary
conducts its Business, and to the knowledge of the Company, there is no
substantial basis for any claim alleging any of the foregoing. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has received any written opinion of counsel that
any Company Product or the operation of the Business does or does not
infringe, misappropriate or violate any Intellectual Property Right of a third
party or that any Intellectual Property Right of a third party is invalid or
unenforceable.

(j) No Company-Owned Intellectual Property or Company Product is subject to
any Legal Proceeding, outstanding Order or "march in" right that restricts in
any manner the use, transfer or licensing thereof by the Company or any
Subsidiary, or that affects the validity, use or enforceability of any such
Company-Owned Intellectual Property.

 

(k) The Company and each Subsidiary has secured from each of their founders,
employees, consultants and independent contractors who independently or
jointly contributed to or participated in the contribution, conception,
reduction to practice, creation or development of any Company-Owned
Intellectual Property for the Company or any Subsidiary (each, an " _Author_
") unencumbered, unrestricted and exclusive ownership of all Intellectual
Property Rights in such contributions. No such Author has retained any rights,
licenses, claims or interest with respect to any Company Intellectual
Property developed by such Author or the Company or any Subsidiary.

(l) To the knowledge of the Company, no current or former employee,
consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary: (i) is
in material violation of any term or covenant of any Contract relating to
employment, invention disclosure (including patent disclosure),
invention assignment, non-disclosure or any other Contract with any other
party by virtue of such employees, consultants or independent contractors
being employed by, or performing services for, the Company or any Subsidiary
or using trade secrets or proprietary information of others without
permission, or (ii) has developed any technology, software or other
copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary work for the Company or any
Subsidiary that is subject to any agreement under which such employee,
consultant or independent contractor has assigned or otherwise granted to any
third party any rights (including Intellectual Property Rights) in or to such
technology, software or other copyrightable, 

 



27  patentable or otherwise proprietary work.

(m) To the knowledge of the Company, the employment of any employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary or the use by the Company or any Subsidiary of the
services of any consultant or independent contractor does not subject the
Company or any Subsidiary to any material Liability to any third party for
improperly soliciting such employee, consultant or independent contractor to
work for or provide services to the Company or any Subsidiary.

 

(n) To the extent any Third-Party Intellectual Property is incorporated into,
integrated or bundled with any of the Company Products, the Company and the
Subsidiaries have a written agreement with such third party with respect
thereto pursuant to which the Company or a Subsidiary have obtained licenses
sufficient for the use and distribution thereof in the conduct of the Business
as such Third-Party Intellectual Property is so incorporated, integrated or
bundled, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(o) The Company and the Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps
to protect and preserve the confidentiality of all confidential or trade
secret information of the Company or provided by any third party to the
Company (" _Confidential Information_ "). All current and former employees and
contractors of the Company and the Subsidiaries and any third party having
access to Confidential Information from the Company have executed and
delivered to the Company a written, legally binding agreement regarding the
protection of such Confidential Information or are otherwise bound by
obligations of confidentiality.

(p) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all licenses

in any such activities within the 12-month period preceding the Agreement Date
to promptly return or destroy all confidential information previously provided
to such Person (and such Persons Representatives) in accordance with the
applicable confidentiality agreement. The Company shall not, and shall cause
the Subsidiaries not to, waive any rights under "standstill" or similar
covenants in confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements entered into in
connection with or applicable to any Acquisition Proposal to which the Company
or any Subsidiary is a party. If any Company Representative takes any action
that the Company is obligated pursuant to this Section 5.3 not to take, then
the Company shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have
breached this Section 5.3.

 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means, with respect to the Company, any agreement,
offer, proposal or indication of interest (other than this Agreement, the
Merger or any other offer, proposal or indication of interest by Parent), or
any public announcement of intention to enter into any such agreement or of
(or intention to make) any offer, proposal or indication of interest,
relating to, or involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase by any Person or
Group, directly or indirectly, of more than 20% of the outstanding voting

offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or
Group beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding voting securities of
the Company, (B) any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to which the
stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such transaction hold
securities representing less than 80% of the outstanding voting power of the
surviving or resulting entity of such transaction (or parent entity of such
surviving or resulting entity), (C) any sale, acquisition, disposition,
mortgage, pledge or other transfer of more than 20% of the assets of the
Company and the Subsidiaries other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, or (D) any liquidation or dissolution of the
Company, or any extraordinary dividend, whether of cash or other property, in
each case of clauses (A)-(D) in any single transaction or series of
related transactions.

(b) _Notice_. The Company shall advise Parent orally and in writing as
promptly as practicable (but in no event more than one Business Day) after
receipt by the Company and/or any Subsidiary (and/or to the knowledge of the
Company, by any Company Representative (excluding, for this purpose, employees
who are not directors or officers)) of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any
inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any
request for non-public information (including access to any of the 

 



54  properties, books or records of the Company or any Subsidiary) that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall
describe the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer or request and the identity
of the Person or Group submitting any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
indication of interest, proposal, offer or request. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed as promptly as practicable (but in no event more
than one Business Day after receipt) of the status and material details of,
and any material amendments or modifications or proposed material amendments
or modifications to, any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of
interest, proposal, offer or request and any material correspondence or
communications related thereto, and shall provide to Parent as promptly as
practicable (but in no event more than one Business Day after receipt) a
true, correct and complete copy of all written materials provided to the
Company, a Subsidiary or a Company Representative in connection with any such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer,
notice or request (including any material amendments or modifications or
proposed material amendments or modifications). The Company shall notify
Parent about any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board
discusses any Acquisition Proposal promptly following such meeting.

(c) _Superior Proposals_. In the event that any Person or Group submits to
the Company (and does not withdraw) an unsolicited, written, _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
national standing) is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.3(a),
the Company may, so long as the Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been
obtained, (i) enter into discussions with such Person or Group regarding such
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) deliver or make available to such Person non-
public information regarding the Company and the Subsidiaries; _provided_
that, in each such case, the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives shall have complied with each of the following: (A) none of
the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives shall have
violated any of the provisions of this Section 5.3 in any material respect,
(B) the Company Board first shall have concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the
Companys stockholders under Applicable Legal Requirements, (C) prior to
making available to any such Person any material non-public information, the
Company first shall have received from such Person an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which executed Acceptable

engaging in any discussions, providing to Parent written notice of its intent
to engage in such discussions and (E) prior to or contemporaneously with

" _Superior Proposal_ " means, with respect to the Company, an unsolicited,
_bona fide_ written offer submitted after the Agreement Date by a Person or
Group to acquire, directly or indirectly, (i) pursuant to a tender offer,
exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination (including
by means of a tender offer followed by a back-end merger) beneficial
ownership of 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the Company
or (ii) 50% or more of the assets of the Company, in each case, for
consideration consisting exclusively of cash, contingent value rights
and/or publicly-traded equity securities that the Company Board has concluded
in its good faith judgment (following consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of national standing), taking into account,
among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other
aspects of the offer, including conditions to consummation and the Person
making the offer, in each case deemed relevant by the Company Board (x) would
be, if consummated, more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the
Companys stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the terms of
this Agreement and (y) is

 



55  reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms proposed.

(d) _Change of Recommendation or Termination for Superior Proposal_. Nothing
in this Agreement shall prevent the Company Board from withholding,
withdrawing, qualifying, amending (in a manner adverse to Parent) or modifying
(in a manner adverse to Parent) the Company Board Recommendation (a " _Change
of Recommendation_ ") in connection with a Superior Proposal or the Company
from terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) to enter into a
definitive agreement to accept a Superior Proposal if:

(i) the Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been obtained;

 

(ii) the Company has complied in all material respects with the provisions of
Section 5.2 and this Section 5.3;

 

(iii) such Superior Proposal has been submitted to the Company, has not been
withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal; 

(iv) the Company has provided to Parent at least four Business Days prior
written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") that stated expressly
(A) that the Company has received such Superior Proposal, (B) the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person
or Group submitting such Superior Proposal and (C) that the Company Board
intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and terminate this Agreement and
has provided Parent with an unredacted copy of such Superior Proposal,
together with unredacted copies of all proposed transaction agreements and
any financing commitments relating thereto (collectively, the " _Superior
Proposal Materials_ "), concurrently with the delivery of such Notice of
Superior Proposal;

 

(v) the Company has, during the four-Business Day period referred to in
Section 5.3(d)(iv), if requested by Parent, made the Company Representatives
available to discuss and negotiate in good faith with Parents Representatives
any modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that Parent
desires to propose such that such Superior Proposal would cease to constitute
a Superior Proposal;

(vi) Parent has not, within four Business Days of Parents receipt of
such Notice of Superior Proposal, made a written, binding and irrevocable
(through the expiration of such four-Business Day period) offer that the
Company Board has concluded in good faith (following consultation with its
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national standing) to be at
least as favorable to the Companys stockholders as such Superior Proposal (it
being agreed that (A) the Company Board shall convene a meeting to consider
any such offer by Parent promptly following the receipt thereof, (B) the
Company Board will not effect a Change of Recommendation and the Company will
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) for four Business Days
after receipt by Parent of such Notice of Superior Proposal and such Superior
Proposal Materials and (C) any change to the financial or other material terms
of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal to
Parent and a new two-Business Day period and discussion process under this
Section 5.3(d) (and all references to four-Business Day periods in this
Section 5.3(d) shall be deemed two-Business Day periods for purposes of this
Section 5.3(d)(vi)(C)); _provided_ that such new Notice of Superior Proposal
shall in no event shorten the original four-Business Day period); and

(vii) the Company Board has concluded in good faith (following consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Superior Proposal and
any modifications

 



56  proposed by Parent pursuant to Section 5.3(d)(vi), the failure to effect a
Change of Recommendation and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(h) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under Applicable Legal Requirements.

(e) _Change of Recommendation for Intervening Event_. Nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company Board from making a Change of
Recommendation for a reason unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any Change of Recommendation proposed to be made
in response to an Acquisition Proposal may only be made pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of Section 5.3(d)) if:

 

(i) the Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been obtained;

 

(ii) the Company has complied in all material respects with the provisions of
Section 5.2 and this Section 5.3;

 

(iii) the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that, in light of material facts, events and/or
circumstances that as of the Agreement Date were unknown by the Company and
which were not reasonably foreseeable as of the Agreement Date (an "
_Intervening Event_ ") and taking into account the results of any discussions
with Parent as contemplated by subsection (iv) and any offer from Parent
contemplated by subsection (v), the failure to make a Change of Recommendation
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under Applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ that in no event
shall any of the following, in and of itself, constitute or be deemed an
Intervening Event: (A) any determination by the Company Board that the Per
Share Cash Amount payable in the Merger is not sufficient, (B) the Company
exceeding any earnings projections or predictions made by the Company (whether
or not publicly announced) or securities or financial analysts and any
resulting analyst upgrades of the Companys securities or any change in the
trading price of the Company Common Stock, (C) any facts, events or
circumstances resulting from any breach of this Agreement by the Company or
(D) the receipt, existence or terms of any Acquisition Proposal or any matter
relating thereto or the consequences thereof;

(iv) the Company has provided to Parent at least four Business Days prior
written notice that the Company Board intends to make a Change of
Recommendation (" _Notice of Intervening Event_ ") and if requested by Parent,
the Company shall have made the Company Representatives available during the
four-Business Day period to discuss with Parents Representatives (A) the
facts, events and circumstances underlying such proposed Change of
Recommendation and the Company Boards reason for proposing to make such
Change of Recommendation and (B) any modifications to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement that Parent desires to propose that that would obviate the
need for the Company Board to make such Change of Recommendation; and

(v) Parent shall not have, within the aforementioned four-Business Day period,
made a written, binding and irrevocable (through the expiration of such four
Business Day period) offer that the Company Board concludes in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
national standing) would obviate the need for the Company Board to make such
Change of Recommendation (it being agreed that (A) the Company Board shall
convene a meeting to consider any such offer by Parent promptly following the
receipt thereof, (B) the Company Board will not make a Change of
Recommendation for four Business Days after receipt by Parent of the Notice of
Intervening Event and (C) any material

 



57  change in the facts, events or circumstances related to the Intervening
Event shall require a new Notice of Intervening Event to Parent and a new two-
Business Day period and discussion process under subsection (iv) (and all
references to four-Business Day periods in this Section 5.3(e) shall be deemed
two-Business Day periods for purposes of this Section 5.3(e)(v)(C));
_provided_ that such new Notice of Intervening Event shall in no event
shorten the original four-Business Day period).

(f) _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing
to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act
or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders that the Company
Board has concluded in good faith (following consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that failure to make such disclosure would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders
under Applicable Legal Requirements (a " _Required Fiduciary Disclosure_ ");
_provided_ that (A) any "stop, look, and listen" communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, and any
substantially similar communication that solely constitutes a recitation of
the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been received and a factual
description of the terms and background thereof, and that no position has
been taken by the Company Board as to the advisability or desirability of such
Acquisition Proposal, shall not be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation,
(B) such Required Fiduciary Disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Change of
Recommendation if it relates to an Acquisition Proposal and the text of such
Required Fiduciary Disclosure includes a public statement that the Company
Board is expressly reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation and (C) the
Company Board shall not recommend that the Companys stockholders tender
shares of Company Capital Stock in connection with any tender or exchange
offer or otherwise effect a Change of Recommendation unless specifically
permitted by, and in accordance with, Section 5.3.

5.4. _Access to Information_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, (i) the Company shall afford Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during business hours to (A) all of the
properties, books, Contracts and records of the Company and each Subsidiary
and (B) all other information concerning the Business, results of operations,
product development efforts, properties (tangible and intangible, including
Intellectual Property) and personnel of the Company or any Subsidiary as
Parent may reasonably request and (ii) the Company shall maintain the virtual
data room established in connection with this Agreement and provide Parent and
its Representatives access thereto; _provided_ that with respect to clause
(i), any such access shall be conducted at a reasonable time, under the
supervision of appropriate personnel of the Company and in such a manner as
not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of
the Company. Nothing herein shall require the Company to disclose any
information to Parent if such disclosure would (i) jeopardize any attorney-
client or other legal privilege (so long as the Company has reasonably
cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection of or to disclose such
information on a basis that does not waive such privilege with respect
thereto) or (ii) contravene any applicable Legal Requirement or
fiduciary duty; _provided_ that information shall be disclosed subject to
execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form, and disclosure may
be limited to external counsel for Parent, to the extent the Company
determines doing so may be reasonably required for the purpose of complying
with applicable Antitrust Laws. With respect to the information disclosed
pursuant to this Section 5.4, Parent shall comply with, and shall instruct
Parents Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to
this Section 5.4 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or condition contained herein.

 



58 5.5. _Confidentiality; Public Disclosure_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously
executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of May 2, 2017 (as may be
amended from time to time in accordance with its terms, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

 

(b) Parent and the Company have agreed to the text of the initial press
release announcing the execution of this Agreement and the Transactions.
Except with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Change of Recommendation
and as provided in Section 5.3 or in connection with any dispute under this
Agreement, the Company shall consult with Parent before issuing or making,
and shall provide and shall not issue any press release or make any public
statement relating to this Agreement or the Transactions without the prior
written consent of Parent; _provided_ that the Company may, without obtaining
such prior consent, issue such press release or make such public statement to
the extent that the Company determines in good faith (following consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that such press release or public statement is
required by Applicable Legal Requirements to be issued or made; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company has used all reasonable efforts to consult and
discuss in good faith with Parent the form and content thereof prior to its
release and has considered in good faith any reasonable changes that are
suggested by Parent prior to releasing or making such press release or public
statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, each
party may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in
response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make
disclosures in Company SEC Reports, so long as such statements are consistent
with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made
jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved by the other party). The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company
Representatives to comply with this Section 5.5. Parent shall consult in good
faith with the Company on its general communications strategy for customers,
suppliers and employees regarding the Merger.

 

5.6. _Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly after the execution of this
Agreement apply for or otherwise seek, and use its respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain, all consents and approvals required to be obtained by it
for the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions. Without
limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, each of Parent and the
Company shall, as soon as practicable, make any initial filings required
under the HSR Act and any other additional filings (" _Merger Notification
Filings_ ") required by the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton
Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, the Applicable
Foreign Antitrust Approvals that are identified on Schedule 5.6(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter and, to the extent mutually determined by the
parties hereto to be required, necessary or advisable, initial filings under
any other Applicable Legal Requirements that are designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ ") (in the case of
filings under the HSR Act, within 15 Business Days after the Agreement Date
unless otherwise mutually agreed by Parent and the Company ( _provided_ that
the filing party has received from the other party all information regarding
such other party as is reasonably necessary to make such filing) and, with
respect to any other Merger Notification Filings, within time periods mutually
agreed by Parent and the Company). The parties hereto shall promptly supply
one another with any information that may be required in order to make such
filings or obtain such consents and approvals. Each party hereto shall (i)
consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views
of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating
to the HSR Act or any foreign or other Antitrust Law, (ii) coordinate with
one another in

 



59  preparing and exchanging such materials and (iii) promptly provide one
another (and its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or
submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such party to
any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement; _provided_ that
with respect to any such analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions or proposals or such filings, presentations or
submissions, each of Parent and the Company need not supply the other (or its
counsel) with copies (or in case of oral presentations, a summary) to the
extent that any Applicable Legal Requirement requires such party or
its subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such information. In
addition, any party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any confidential and competitively sensitive material provided to
the other parties under this Section 5.6 as "Outside Counsel Only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient, unless
express written permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials.

(b) Each party hereto will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of (i)
any comments from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with
any Merger Notification Filings made pursuant hereto, (ii) any request by any
officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any
Merger Notification Filings made pursuant to, or information provided to
comply in all material respects with, any Applicable Legal Requirements and
(iii) any proposal by a Governmental Entity regarding a settlement of any
investigation. Each party hereto will respond promptly to and comply with any
request for information relating to this Agreement or the Merger Notification
Filings from any Governmental Entity charged with enforcing, applying,
administering or investigating any Antitrust Laws. Whenever any event occurs
that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any Merger
Notification Filing made pursuant to Section 5.6(a), each party hereto will
promptly inform the other parties of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its respective reasonable best
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions under any applicable
Antitrust Laws. Parent and the Company shall take any and all of the following
actions to the extent necessary to cause the expiration of the notice periods
under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the
Transactions and to obtain the approval of any Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over the enforcement of any Applicable Legal Requirements
regarding the Transactions: (i) entering into negotiations, (ii) providing
information required by Applicable Legal Requirements and (iii) substantially
complying with any "second request" for information pursuant to applicable
Antitrust Laws.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if any Legal Proceeding
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or the
other Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law, it is expressly
understood and agreed that (i) Parent shall not have any obligation to
litigate or contest any such Legal Proceeding or Order resulting therefrom
and (ii) Parent shall be under no obligation to make proposals, execute or
carry out agreements or submit to Orders providing for (A) the sale, license
or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust
or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of Parent or the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates, (B) the imposition of any limitation or
restriction on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to freely
conduct their business or, following the Closing, the Business or own such
assets or (C) the holding separate of the shares of Company Capital Stock or
any limitation or regulation on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates
to exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of Company Capital Stock
(any of the foregoing, an " _Antitrust Restraint_ ").

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.6 shall limit a partys right to terminate the
Agreement

 



60  pursuant to Section 7.1(b) so long as such party has until such date
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 5.6.

 

5.7. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 5.6(d), each of the parties hereto agrees to use its respective
reasonable best efforts, and to cooperate with each other party hereto to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, appropriate or desirable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other Transactions, including (i) taking all reasonable actions necessary to
satisfy the respective conditions set forth in Article VI and (ii) executing
and delivering such other instruments and doing and performing such other
acts and things as may be reasonably necessary, appropriate or desirable to
effect completely the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions.

 

5.8. _Third-Party Consents; Consultations_.

 

(a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (not to require
a concession or expenditure other than immaterial processing or consent fees)
to obtain, prior to the Closing, all consents, waivers and approvals of or
under Contracts of the Company or a Subsidiary reasonably requested by Parent.
For the avoidance of doubt, the failure to obtain any such consent, waiver
or approval shall not constitute a breach of covenant or agreement for all
purposes of this Agreement, including Section 6.3(b).

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Agreement Date, the Company
will initiate a process of informing and consulting appropriate
representatives of its non-U.S. employees or the non-U.S. employees
themselves, to the extent required under Applicable Legal Requirements,
regarding a prospective transfer of employment to Parent or any of its
Affiliates with effect following the Closing. Subject to Section 5.4 and
Applicable Legal Requirements, the Company shall allow Parent or its relevant
Affiliate to participate in such information and consultation process.

5.9. _Notice of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to notify Parent
in writing promptly after obtaining knowledge of: (i) any written notice or
other written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger, (ii) any written
notice or other written communication from any Governmental Entity or any
official or employee of any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger,
(iii) any Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity being
initiated by or against it or any Subsidiary, or known by the Company or any
Subsidiary to be threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees or stockholders in their
capacity as such, that, had it occurred prior to the Agreement Date, would
have constituted an exception to the representation set forth in the first
sentence of Section 2.6, or (iv) any event that occurs after the Agreement
Date, that, had it occurred prior to the Agreement Date, would have
constituted an exception to the representations set forth in the first
sentence of Section 2.12(c).

(b) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Company
in writing promptly after obtaining knowledge of: (i) any written notice or
other written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger, (ii) any written
notice or other written communication from any Governmental Entity or any
official or employee of any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger,
(iii) any Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity being
initiated by or against it, or known by Parent to be threatened against
Parent or any of its respective directors, officers, employees or stockholders
in their capacity as such, or of any written correspondence from any Person
asserting or threatening a claim 

 



61  against Parent that relates to this Agreement or the Merger, in each of
clauses (i) through (iii) that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay Parents ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(c) Each party will notify the other party in writing promptly after learning
of any change, occurrence or event that is reasonably likely to cause any of
such other partys conditions to closing set forth in Article VI not to be
satisfied.

 

(d) No notification given pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements herein or affect
the satisfaction or non-satisfaction of any conditions to the obligations of
the parties hereto under this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to Parent or the Company.

 

5.10. _Employees and Contractors_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
ensure that the Continuing Employees shall receive retirement, health and
welfare benefits that in the aggregate for each such employee are no less
favorable than those provided to a similarly situated employee of Parent or
its Affiliates who is not a Continuing Employee taking into account the
employees geographic location.

(b) Except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its other
Affiliates to, recognize the service of each Continuing Employee with the
Company or its Affiliates before the Effective Time (to the same extent
recognized by the Company or its Affiliates immediately prior to
the Effective Time) as if such service had been performed with Parent or its
Affiliates for all purposes under the vacation, paid time off and severance
plans maintained by Parent or its Affiliates after the Effective Time and for
purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefit and benefit accrual (but
not for purposes of benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan)
under all other employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Parent or
its Affiliates that such employees may be eligible to participate in after
the Effective Time.

(c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or its Affiliates
in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective
Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its other
Affiliates to, to the extent permitted by the relevant welfare plan and
consistent with such plans application to similarly situated employees of
Parent or its Affiliates who are not Continuing Employees, waive all
limitations as to waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements, evidence or
insurability requirements, preexisting condition limitations and other
exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
to such employees (and their spouses, domestic partners and dependents) to the
extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply under
the welfare plans maintained by the Company or its Affiliates prior to the
Effective Time.

(d) This Section 5.10 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each party hereto (meaning, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent, Sub and the
Company), and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.10. In no event shall the
terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any
Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) alter or limit the
ability of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation) to amend, modify or terminate any of the Company Employee Plans
or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement
after the Effective Time or (iii)

repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective
Time in any manner that adversely affects the rights thereunder of the

maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary as of the Agreement Date in the
form made available by the Company to Parent prior to the Agreement Date (the
" _Existing D andO Policy_"), to the extent that directors and officers
liability insurance coverage is commercially available; _provided_ that: (i)
the Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing DandO Policy a policy
or policies of comparable coverage, including a "tail" or "runoff" insurance
policy, (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual
premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or for any substitute or "tail"
policies) in excess of an amount equal to 300% of the most recently paid
annual premium for the Existing DandO Policy (the " _Maximum Premium_ ") and
(iii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall issue a broker of record
letter acceptable to Parent permitting Parents insurance broker to negotiate
and place such "tail" or "runoff" insurance of comparable coverage, Parent
shall have the right to negotiate such coverage and the Company shall
reasonably cooperate therewith. In the event any future annual premiums for
the Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute policies) exceed the Maximum
Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the amount of
coverage of the Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute or "tail" policies) to
the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal to the
Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company in its sole
discretion elects, by giving written notice to Parent at least two Business

Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the
Termination Fee due pursuant to Section 7.3(b), and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment for the amounts set
forth in Section 7.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount set forth in Section
7.3(b) at the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. in effect from time to time
from the date such payment was required to be made hereunder. All payments
under Section 7.3(b) and this Section 7.3(d) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent. Payment
of the Termination Fee (and any additional amounts required under this
Section 7.3(c)) to Parent by the Company in accordance with this Agreement
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages for any actual or purported breach of this Agreement and
for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent or any of its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis
for such termination and, after such payment has been made, the Company and
its Affiliates shall have no further liability for any such actual or
purported breach or for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination.

 

(e) Parent acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in Section 7.3(c)
are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) the amount of, and the basis
for payment of, the Parent Expense Reimbursement is reasonable and appropriate
in all respects and (iii) without this agreement, the Company would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent fails to pay in a timely manner
the Parent Expense Reimbursement due pursuant to Section 7.3(c), and, in order
to obtain such payment, the Company makes a claim that results in a judgment
for the amounts set forth in Section 7.3(c), Parent shall pay to the Company
its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
set forth in Section 7.3(c) at the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A.
in effect from time to time from the date such payment was required to be
made hereunder. All payments under Section 7.3(c) and this Section 7.3(e)
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Company.

(f) " _Acquisition_ " means any of the following transactions (other than the
Transactions): (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction or series of
transactions involving the Company pursuant to which the stockholders of the
Company immediately preceding such transaction or series of transactions hold
less than 50% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction or series of transactions or any direct or indirect
parent thereto, (ii) a sale or other disposition in a transaction or series
of transactions by the Company or the Subsidiaries of assets representing in
excess of 50% of the aggregate fair market value of the assets of the Company
and the Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction or series
of transactions or (iii) the acquisition by any Person or Group (including by
way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by the Company),
directly or indirectly, in a transaction or series of transactions, of
beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares
representing in excess of 50% of the voting power of the shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction or series of
transactions.

 



71 (g) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion,
whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable under more than one
provision of this Agreement at the same or at different time and the
occurrence of different events.

 

7.4. _Amendment_. Subject to Applicable Legal Requirements, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors, at any time before or after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained pursuant to an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto; _provided_ that, after
the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no such amendment shall
be made to the extent that Applicable Legal Requirements would require further
approval by the Companys stockholders without such further stockholder
approval.

 

7.5. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for
the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The agreement of
Parent to any extension or waiver shall be deemed to be the agreement of Sub
to such extension or waiver. No delay in exercising any rights under this
Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such right, and no waiver of any
breach or default shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default of
the same or any other provision of this Agreement.

8.3. _Interpretation_.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections or
Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit
to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is made to a
Schedule, such reference shall be to a Schedule of the Company Disclosure
Letter. Where a reference is made to an Applicable Legal Requirement, such
reference is to such Applicable Legal Requirement as then in effect. Where a
reference is made to a Contract or instrument such reference is to such
Contract or instrument as then in effect. The headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

(b) The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be

 



73  deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
phrases "provide to" and "deliver to" and phrases of similar import when used
herein, unless the context otherwise requires, shall mean that a true,
correct and complete paper or electronic copy of the information or material
referred to has been delivered to the party to whom such information or
material is to be provided. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise
requires: (i) words of any gender include each other gender, (ii) words using
the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number,
respectively and (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereto," "hereunder"
and derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement and (iv)
references to clauses without a cross-reference to a Section or subsection are
references to clauses within the same Section or, if more specific,
subsection. References to any Person include the successors and permitted
assigns of that Person. References to any statute are to that statute, as then
in effect, and to the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
References to "$" and "dollars" are to the currency of the United States.
References from or through any date shall mean, unless otherwise specified,
from and including or through and including, respectively. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and
neuter genders of such term. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent"
shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such
phrase shall not mean simply "if." All references to "days" shall be to
calendar days unless otherwise indicated as a "Business Day."

(c) Unless indicated otherwise, all mathematical calculations contemplated by
this Agreement shall be rounded to the tenth decimal place.

(d) The 0.5% threshold established by the parties hereto with respect to
the Companys capitalization in Section 6.3(a) shall not, in and of itself,
constitute an economic benchmark for determining whether any Effect shall be
deemed to be material in relation to the Company and the Business or shall be
deemed to constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

8.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; _it
being_ _understood_ that all parties hereto need not sign the same
counterpart.

8.5. _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement and the documents
and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or
delivered pursuant hereto, including all schedules and exhibits attached
hereto, and the Company Disclosure Letter, (i) constitute the entire agreement
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for
the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect,
and shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in accordance with its
terms, and (ii) are not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as
conferring, upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, except the Indemnified Parties as expressly set forth in
Section 5.12.

8.6. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such
assignment or delegation without such prior written consent shall be null and
void, except that Parent may make such assignment or delegation to any direct
or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent without the prior consent of
any other party hereto; _provided_ that Parent shall remain liable for all of
its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 



74 8.7. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

8.8. _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein (including Section 7.3), any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy shall not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall
be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or
injunctive relief. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties
hereto hereby waive the requirement of any posting of a bond in connection
with the remedies described herein. Each of the parties agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief on the basis that the other party has an adequate remedy at
law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity.

 

8.9. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of laws, provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws
of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware. The
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that
court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Wilmington,
Delaware, in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions
of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in
respect of the Transactions and thereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to
assert, as a defense in any Legal Proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such
Legal Proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or
that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any
such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such Legal Proceeding shall
be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereto hereby consent to
and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and
over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or
other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner
provided in Section 8.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by
Applicable Legal Requirements, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

8.10. _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each Schedule
and each Exhibit attached hereto, the application of any Applicable Legal
Requirement, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document shall be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

 

8.11. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT

 



75  OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

FORM OF BYLAWS

OF 

BROADSOFT, INC.

 

A Delaware Corporation

 

ARTICLE I

STOCKHOLDERS 

_Section 1.1_: _Annual Meetings_. Unless directors are elected by written
consent in lieu of an annual meeting, as permitted by Section 211 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law, an annual meeting of stockholders shall be
held for the election of directors at such date and time as the Board of
Directors shall each year fix. The meeting may be held either at a place,
within or without the State of Delaware, or by means of remote communication
as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may determine. Any other
proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting.

 

 _Section 1.2_: _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders for any
purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, the
Chairperson of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the
President, or by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors. Special
meetings may not be called by any other person or persons.

 

 _Section 1.3_: _Notice of Meetings_. Notice of all meetings of stockholders
shall be given in writing or by electronic transmission in the manner
provided by law (including, without limitation, as set forth in Section 7.1(b)
of these Bylaws) stating the date, time and place, if any, of the meeting and,
in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the
meeting is called. Unless otherwise required by applicable law or the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, such notice shall be given
not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of
the meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting.

_Section 1.4_: _Adjournments_. The chair of any meeting of stockholders
shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting,
including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of
discussion as seems to him or her to be in order. The chair shall have the
power to adjourn the meeting to another time, date and place (if any). Any
meeting of stockholders may adjourn from time to time, and notice need not be
given of any such adjourned meeting if the time, date and place (if any)
thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30)
days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned
meeting, then a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At the adjourned
meeting the Corporation may transact any business that might have been
transacted at the original meeting.

 

 _Section 1.5_: _Quorum_. At each meeting of stockholders the holders of a
majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting, present in
person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business, except if otherwise required by applicable  law. If a quorum shall fail to attend any meeting, the chairperson of the
meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are
present, in person or by proxy, at the meeting may adjourn the meeting.
Shares of the Corporations stock belonging to the Corporation (or to another
corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of
directors of such other corporation are held, directly or indirectly, by the
Corporation), shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum
purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit the
right of the Corporation or any other corporation to vote any shares of the
Corporations stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity and to count such
shares for purposes of determining a quorum.

 

 _Section 1.6_: _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided
over by such person as the Board of Directors may designate, or, in the
absence of such a person, the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, or, in
the absence of such person, the President of the Corporation, or, in the
absence of such person, such person as may be chosen by the holders of
a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by
proxy, at the meeting. Such person shall be chairperson of the meeting and,
subject to Section 1.11 hereof, shall determine the order of business and the
procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting
and the conduct of discussion as seems to him or her to be in order. The
Secretary of the Corporation shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in
such persons absence the chairperson of the meeting may appoint any person
to act as secretary of the meeting.

_Section 1.7_: _Voting; Proxies_. Unless otherwise provided by law or the
Certificate of Incorporation, and subject to the provisions of Section 1.8 of
these Bylaws, each stockholder shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each
share of stock held by such stockholder. Each stockholder entitled to vote at
a meeting of stockholders, or to take corporate action by written consent
without a meeting, may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder by proxy. Such a proxy may be prepared, transmitted and delivered
in any manner permitted by applicable law. Voting at meetings of stockholders
need not be by written ballot unless such is demanded at the meeting before
voting begins by a stockholder or stockholders holding shares representing at
least one percent (1%) of the votes entitled to vote at such meeting, or by
such stockholders or stockholders proxy; _provided_ , _however_ , that an
election of directors shall be by written ballot if demand is so made by
any stockholder at the meeting before voting begins. If a vote is to be taken
by written ballot, then each such ballot shall state the name of the
stockholder or proxy voting and such other information as the chairperson of
the meeting deems appropriate and, if authorized by the Board of Directors,
the ballot may be submitted by electronic transmission in the manner provided
by law. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares
present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote
on the election of directors. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, every matter other than the
election of directors shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote thereon that are present
in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and are voted for or against
the matter.

 

 _Section 1.8_: _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_. In
order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice
of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to
take corporate action by written consent without a meeting, or entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted

 



2  by the Board of Directors and which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor
less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty
(60) days prior to any other action. If no record date is fixed by the Board
of Directors, then the record date shall be as provided by applicable law. A
determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date
for the adjourned meeting.

 

 _Section 1.9_: _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. A complete list of
stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, arranged in
alphabetical order and showing the address of each stockholder and the number
of shares registered in the name of each stockholder, shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting,
during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior
to the meeting, either on a reasonably accessible electronic network as
permitted by law (provided that the information required to gain access to the
list is provided with the notice of the meeting) or during ordinary business
hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation. If the meeting is
held at a place, the list shall also be produced and kept at the time and

 _Section 1.10_: _Action by Written Consent of Stockholders_.

 

(a) _Procedure_. Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of
Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or
special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without
prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents are in writing,
setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed in the manner permitted by
law by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the number of
votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Written
stockholder consents shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who
signs the consent in the manner permitted by law and shall be delivered to the
Corporation as provided in subsection (b) below. No written consent shall be
effective to take the action set forth therein unless, within sixty (60) days
of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation in the manner
provided above, written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders
to take the action set forth therein are delivered to the Corporation in the
manner provided above.

(b) A telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission consenting to an
action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or a
person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be
deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of this section,
provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission
sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can
determine (i) that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission
was transmitted by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons
authorized to act for the stockholder or proxyholder and (ii) the date on
which such stockholder or proxyholder or authorized person or persons
transmitted such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on
which such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission is transmitted
shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed. No consent
given by telegram, cablegram or other electronic

 



3  transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such consent is
reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be delivered to the
Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware,
its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Corporation
having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders
are recorded. Delivery made to a Corporations registered office shall be
made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on delivery, consents given by
telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission may be otherwise
delivered to the principal place of business of the Corporation or to an
officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded if, to the extent and in
the manner provided by resolution of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.

(c) _Notice of Consent_. Prompt notice of the taking of corporate action by
stockholders without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent of the
stockholders shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented
thereto in writing and, who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would
have been entitled to notice of the meeting, if the record date for such
meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number
of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation as required by
law. In the case of a Certificate of Action (as defined below), if the
Delaware General Corporation Law so requires, such notice shall be given prior
to filing of the certificate in question. If the action which is consented to
requires the filing of a certificate under the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the " _Certificate of Action_ "), then if the Delaware General
Corporation Law so requires, the certificate so filed shall state that written
stockholder consent has been given in accordance with Section 228 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law and that written notice of the taking of
corporate action by stockholders without a meeting as described herein has
been given as provided in such section.

 

 _Section 1.11_: _Inspectors of Elections_.

 

(a) _Applicability_. Unless otherwise provided in the Corporations
Certificate of Incorporation or required by the Delaware General Corporation
Law, the following provisions of this Section 1.11 shall apply only if and
when the Corporation has a class of voting stock that is: (i) listed on a
national securities exchange; (ii) authorized for quotation on an automated
interdealer quotation system of a registered national securities association;
or (iii) held of record by more than two thousand (2,000) stockholders. In all
other cases, observance of the provisions of this Section 1.11 shall be
optional, and at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(b) _Appointment_. The Corporation shall, in advance of any meeting of
stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election to act at the meeting
and make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more
persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If
no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the
person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at
the meeting.

 

(c) _Inspector s Oath_. Each inspector of election, before entering upon the
discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute
the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of
such inspectors ability.

 



4 (d) _Duties of Inspectors_. At a meeting of stockholders, the inspectors of
election shall (i) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting
power of each share, (ii) determine the shares represented at a meeting and
the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv)
determine and retain for a reasonable period of time a record of the
disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and
(v) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the
meeting, and their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may appoint
or retain other persons or entities to assist the inspectors in the
performance of the duties of the inspectors.

 

(e) _Opening and Closing of Polls_. The date and time of the opening and the
closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at
a meeting shall be announced by the inspectors at the meeting. No ballot,
proxies or votes, nor any revocations thereof or changes thereto, shall be
accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls unless the Court of
Chancery upon application by a stockholder shall determine otherwise.

(f) _Determinations_. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and
ballots, the inspectors shall be limited to an examination of the proxies, any
envelopes submitted with those proxies, any information provided in connection
with proxies in accordance with Section 212(c)(2) of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, ballots and the regular books and records of the Corporation,
except that the inspectors may consider other reliable information for the
limited purpose of reconciling proxies and ballots submitted by or on
behalf of banks, brokers, their nominees or similar persons which represent
more votes than the holder of a proxy is authorized by the record owner to
cast or more votes than the stockholder holds of record. If the inspectors
consider other reliable information for the limited purpose permitted herein,
the inspectors at the time they make their certification of their
determinations pursuant to this Section 1.11 shall specify the precise
information considered by them, including the person or persons from whom
they obtained the information, when the information was obtained, the means by
which the information was obtained and the basis for the inspectors belief
that such information is accurate and reliable.

INDEMNIFICATION

was or is made a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, or is
involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (the " _Proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact
that such person (or a person of whom such person is the legal
representative), is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or a
Reincorporated Predecessor (as defined below) or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation or a Reincorporated Predecessor (as defined below)
as a director or officer of another corporation, or of a partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee
benefit plans, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to
the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, against
all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines,
ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement)
reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith,
provided such person acted in good faith and in a manner which the person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or Proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe the persons conduct was unlawful. Such
indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director
or officer and shall inure to the benefit of such persons heirs, executors
and administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall
indemnify any such person seeking indemnity in connection with a Proceeding
(or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such Proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. As used
herein, the term the " _Reincorporated Predecessor_ " means a corporation that
is merged with and into the Corporation in a statutory merger where (a) the
Corporation is the surviving corporation of such merger; (b) the primary
purpose of such merger is to change the corporate domicile of the
Reincorporated Predecessor to Delaware.

 

 _Section 6.2_: _Advance of Expenses_. The Corporation shall pay all expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by such a director or officer in
defending any such Proceeding as they are incurred in advance of its final
disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Delaware General Corporation
Law then so requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by such a
director or officer in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding
shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or
on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if
it should be determined ultimately that such director or officer is not
entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise; and _provided_
, _further_ , that the

 



10  Corporation shall not be required to advance any expenses to a person
against whom the Corporation directly brings a claim, in a Proceeding,
alleging that such person has breached such persons duty of loyalty to the
Corporation, committed an act or omission not in good faith or that involves
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, or derived an improper
personal benefit from a transaction.

 

 _Section 6.3: Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person
in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right that such person
may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate
of Incorporation, Bylaw, agreement, vote or consent of stockholders or
disinterested directors, or otherwise. Additionally, nothing in this Article
VI shall limit the ability of the Corporation, in its discretion, to indemnify
or advance expenses to persons whom the Corporation is not obligated to
indemnify or advance expenses pursuant to this Article VI.

 

 _Section 6.4_: _Indemnification Contracts_. The Board of Directors is
authorized to cause the Corporation to enter into indemnification contracts
with any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or any
person serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, including employee benefit plans, providing
indemnification rights to such person. Such rights may be greater than those
provided in this Article VI.

 

 _Section 6.5_: _Effect of Amendment_. Any amendment, repeal or modification
of any provision of this Article VI shall be prospective only, and shall not
adversely affect any right or protection conferred on a person pursuant to
this Article VI and existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or
modification.

 

ARTICLE VII

NOTICES 

_Section 7.1_: _Notice_. (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided in
these Bylaws (including, without limitation, Section 7.1(b) below) or
required by law, all notices required to be given pursuant to these Bylaws
shall be in writing and may in every instance be effectively given by hand
delivery (including use of a delivery service), by depositing such notice in
the mail, postage prepaid, or by sending such notice by prepaid telegram,
telex, overnight express courier, mailgram or facsimile. Any such notice shall
be addressed to the person to whom notice is to be given at such persons
address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. The notice shall be
deemed given (i) in the case of hand delivery, when received by the person to
whom notice is to be given or by any person accepting such notice on
behalf of such person, (ii) in the case of delivery by mail, upon deposit in
the mail, (iii) in the case of delivery by overnight express courier, when
dispatched, and (iv) in the case of delivery via telegram, telex, mailgram, or
facsimile, when dispatched.

(b) Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given
effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the
Corporation under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the
Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a
form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the
notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by
written notice to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if
(i) the Corporation is unable to

 



11  deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the
Corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes
known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or to the
transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice;
provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a
revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given
pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile
telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has
consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to
an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive
notice; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate
notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such
posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by any other
form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.

 

(c) An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer
agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given in
writing or by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of
fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

 

 _Section 7.2_: _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever notice is required to be given
under any provision of these Bylaws, a written waiver of notice, signed by
the person entitled to notice, or waiver by electronic transmission by such
person, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for
the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a
committee of directors need be specified in any waiver of notice.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 _Section 8.1_: _Interested Directors; Quorum_. No contract or transaction
between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or
between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or
other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are
directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void
or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer
is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or
committee thereof that authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely
because his, her or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (i) the
material facts as to his, her or their relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors
or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith

transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the
stockholders; or (iii) the contract or transaction is fair as to the
Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the Board
of Directors, a committee thereof, or the stockholders. Interested directors
may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the
Board of Directors or of a committee which authorizes the contract or
transaction.
