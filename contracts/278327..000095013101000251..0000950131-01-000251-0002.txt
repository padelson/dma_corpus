the Closing Date, including without limitation such of the foregoing (i) as
constitute, may constitute or are alleged to constitute a tort, breach of
contract or violation of requirement of any Law, or (ii) that relate to,

IV   PURCHASE PRICE   4.1 Purchase Price. In consideration of the
conveyance to Purchaser of  -------------- each Seller\'s right, title and

Purchaser pursuant hereto, and subject to the conditions and in accordance
with terms hereof, at Closing, Purchaser shall (i) assume the Assumed
Liabilities and (ii) pay TWA an aggregate of $500,000,000 in cash, subject to
adjustments as provided in Section 4.3 and Section 4.4 (the "Purchase 
----------- ----------- Price") and any offsets to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 4.7.  -----------   4    4.2 Allocation of Purchase
Price. Purchaser shall, within 120 days after 
---------------------------- the Closing Date, prepare and deliver to TWA for
its consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) a schedule
allocating the Purchase Price among the Transferred Assets in accordance with
Treasury Regulation 1.1060-1T (or any comparable provisions of state or local
tax law) or any successor provision. If TWA raises objections, Purchaser and
TWA will negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections. Purchaser, TWA
and each other Seller shall report and file all Tax Returns (including
amended Tax Returns and claims for refund) consistent with the allocation,
and shall take no position contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith
(including, without limitation, in any audits or examinations by any taxing
authority or any other proceedings). Purchaser, TWA and each other Seller
shall cooperate in the filing of any forms (including Form 8594) with respect
to such allocation, including any amendments to such forms required with
respect to any adjustment to the Purchase Price, pursuant to this Agreement.
If and to the extent the parties are unable to agree on such allocation, each
shall be free to make its own allocation for tax purposes. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement, the foregoing agreement shall survive
the Closing Date without limitation.   4.3 Working Capital Adjustment. 
--------------------------   (a) Prior to Closing, Purchaser shall prepare
and deliver to TWA in accordance with Section 13.1 an estimated statement of
certain working capital  ------------ accounts of TWA as of the Closing Date
in the format of Schedule 4.3(a) hereto  --------------- (the "Pre-Closing
Statement"). The Pre-Closing Statement shall be prepared by Purchaser in good
faith on a basis consistent in all material respects with the methods,
principles, practices and policies employed in the preparation
and presentation of the consolidated balance sheet of TWA and its
subsidiaries as of September 30, 2000 as included in TWA\'s quarterly report
on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2000, as filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "September Balance Sheet"), and in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied
(without regard to consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement).   (b) Based on the Pre-Closing Statement, the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted immediately prior to Closing as follows:   (i) the
Purchase Price shall be (A) increased by 100% of the  amount, if any, by
which the Accounts Receivable Amount is greater than  $245,732,000 or (B)
decreased by 100% of the amount, if any, by which the  Accounts Receivable
Amount is less than $245,732,000;   (ii) the Purchase Price shall be (A)
increased by 50% of the  amount, if any, by which the Spare Parts Amount is
greater than  $106,333,000 or (B) decreased by 50% of the amount, if any, by
which the  Spare Parts Amount is less than $106,333,000;   (iii) the
Purchase Price shall be (A) increased by 100% of the  amount, if any, by
which the Advance Ticket Sales Amount is less than   5    $304,647,000 or
(B) decreased by 100% of the amount, if any, by which the  Advance Ticket
Sales Amount is greater than $304,647,000; and   (iv) the Purchase Price
shall be (A) increased by 100% of the  amount, if any, by which the Accrued
Employee Expenses Amount is less than  $122,288,000 or (B) decreased by 100%
of the amount, if any, by which the  Accrued Employee Expenses Amount is
greater than $122,288,000.   (c) Within 20 Business Days after Closing,
Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to TWA in accordance with Section 13.1 a
statement of certain working  ------------ capital accounts of TWA as of the
Closing Date in the format of Schedule 4.3(a)  --------------- hereto (the
"Closing Statement"). The Closing Statement shall be prepared by Purchaser in
good faith on a basis consistent in all material respects with the methods,
principles, practices and policies employed in the preparation
and presentation of the September Balance Sheet, and in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied (without regard
to consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).   (d)
After receipt of the Closing Statement, TWA shall have 10 Business Days to
review it together with the work papers used in the preparation
thereof. Unless TWA delivers written notice to Purchaser on or prior to the
10th Business Day after TWA\'s receipt of the Closing Statement stating that
it has objections thereto, TWA shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to
the Closing Statement. TWA shall not object to any method, principle,
practice or policy employed in the preparation of the Closing Statement if
such method, principle, practice or policy is consistent in all material
respects with that employed in the preparation and presentation of the
September Balance Sheet. If, however, TWA notifies Purchaser of objections to
the Closing Statement on or prior to the 10th Business Day after TWA\'s
receipt of the Closing Statement, the parties shall in good faith attempt to
resolve, within 10 Business Days (or such longer period as the parties may
agree in writing) following such notice (the "Resolution Period"), their
differences with respect to such objections and any resolution by them as to
any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive.   (e) Amounts
relating to any working capital account set forth in the Closing Statement
remaining in dispute at the conclusion of the Resolution Period shall be
promptly submitted to the Bankruptcy Court for determination.   (f) Once the
Closing Statement has been finalized in accordance with this Section 4.3 (as
so finalized, the "Final Closing Statement"), the Purchase 
----------- Price (without giving effect to the adjustment provided by
Section 4.3(b)) shall  -------------- be adjusted as follows:   (i) the
Purchase Price shall be (A) increased by 100% of the  amount, if any, by
which the Accounts Receivable Amount is greater than  $245,732,000 or (B)
decreased by 100% of the amount, if any, by which the  Accounts Receivable
Amount is less than $245,732,000;   6    (ii) the Purchase Price shall be
(A) increased by 50% of the  amount, if any, by which the Spare Parts Amount
is greater than  $106,333,000 or (B) decreased by 50% of the amount, if any,
by which the  Spare Parts Amount is less than $106,333,000;   (iii) the
Purchase Price shall be (A) increased by 100% of the  amount, if any, by
which the Advance Ticket Sales Amount is less than  $304,647,000 or (B)
decreased by 100% of the amount, if any, by which the  Advance Ticket Sales
Amount is greater than $304,647,000; and   (iv) the Purchase Price shall be
(A) increased by 100% of the  amount, if any, by which the Accrued Employee
Expenses Amount is less than  $122,288,000 or (B) decreased by 100% of the
amount, if any, by which the  Accrued Employee Expenses Amount is greater
than $122,288,000.   (g) If the Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to
Section 4.3(f) is  -------------- less than the Purchase Price as adjusted
pursuant to Section 4.3(b), TWA shall  -------------- promptly pay Purchaser
an amount of cash equal to the difference obtained by subtracting the
Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to Section 4.3(f) from the 
-------------- Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to Section 4.3(b). If the
Purchase Price as  -------------- adjusted pursuant to Section 4.3(f) is
greater than the Purchase Price as  -------------- adjusted pursuant to
Section 4.3(b), Purchaser shall promptly pay TWA an amount 
-------------- of cash equal to the difference obtained by subtracting the
Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to Section 4.3(b) from the Purchase Price
as adjusted pursuant  -------------- to Section 4.3(f).  --------------  
(h) During the preparation of the Pre-Closing Statement and Closing Statement
and the period of any review or dispute within the contemplation of this
Section 4.3, TWA shall, and shall cause the other Sellers and all 
----------- representatives of the Sellers (including, without limitation,
TWA\'s auditors) to, (i) provide Purchaser and its authorized representatives
with full access at all reasonable times, and in a manner so as not to
interfere unreasonably with the normal business operations of TWA and the
other Sellers, to all relevant books, records, work papers, information and
employees of such Persons, and (ii) cooperate fully with the Purchaser and
its authorized representatives, in each case (i) and (ii), as necessary or
useful for the preparation, calculation and review of the Pre-Closing
Statement and Closing Statement or for the contemplated resolution of any
dispute between the parties relating thereto.   (i) Notwithstanding anything
in this Section 4.3 to the contrary, no  ----------- adjustment to the
Purchase Price shall be made unless and until the aggregate adjustment to the
Purchase Price that would otherwise be required by this Section 4.3 shall
equal or exceed $5,000,000, in which case the full amount
of ----------- such adjustment shall be made to the Purchase Price pursuant
to this Section 4.3  ----------- without regard to this paragraph (i).  
4.4 Other Adjustments to Purchase Price. 
-----------------------------------   (a) In the event that, as a result of
the operation of Section 11.1 or  ------------ upon mutual agreement of the
parties, any Transferred Asset that would be otherwise   7   purchased
at the Closing is not purchased at the Closing (or in the event that any
tangible Transferred Asset has been damaged as described in Section 11.1, 
------------ but such damage has not been fully repaired), then the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price allocable to such
Transferred Asset in a manner consistent with Schedule 4.4 (or, in the case
of such damaged asset,  ------------ by the amount necessary to fully repair
such damaged asset) except as otherwise set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), (d)
and (e) below.   (b) With respect to each Owned Aircraft, the portion of the
Purchase Price allocated to each such item (and accordingly, the Purchase
Price as a whole) shall be adjusted as follows:   (i) reduced by the amount
such Owned Aircraft has depreciated,  determined as set forth on Schedule
4.4, from the date of this Agreement  ------------  until the date of
delivery of such Owned Aircraft;   (ii) if any Owned Aircraft is not in
Delivery Condition as of the  Closing Date, reduced by an amount equal to the
product obtained by  multiplying the number of Owned Aircraft that are not in
Delivery Condition  as of the Closing Date by $50,000; and   (iii) for each
Owned Aircraft that is not to be transferred to  Purchaser at the Closing for
any reason, reduced by an amount consistent  with the allocations as set
forth on Schedule 4.4.  ------------   (c) With respect to each Leased
Aircraft, the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to each such item (and
accordingly, the Purchase Price as a whole) shall be adjusted as follows:  
(i) if any Leased Aircraft is not in Delivery Condition as of the  Closing
Date, reduced by an amount equal to the product obtained by  multiplying the
number of Leased Aircraft that are not in Delivery  Condition as of the
Closing Date by $50,000; and   (ii) for each Leased Aircraft that is not to
be transferred to  Purchaser at the Closing for any reason, reduced by an
amount consistent  with the allocations as set forth on Schedule 4.4. 
------------   (d) With respect to any Slot, Gate, Gate Lease, Ground
Equipment, Ground Equipment Lease, Gate Property, Gate Property Lease,
Engine, Spare Part or any other Transferred Asset that is not to be
transferred to Purchaser at the Closing for any reason, the portion of the
Purchase Price allocated to each such item (and accordingly, the Purchase
Price as a whole) shall be reduced by an amount consistent with the
allocations as set forth on Schedule 4.4 or as  ------------ mutually agreed
by the parties hereto if not specifically included thereon.   (e) With
respect to each Designated Aircraft Lease and Designated Gate Lease, all

the Bankruptcy Court, the performance by each Seller of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or such Collateral Agreements, as applicable,
will not, (a) conflict with, or result in any violation of, or constitute a
default under (except as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases), or, as
applicable, give rise to the creation of a Lien upon any of the Transferred

aircraft in such condition as may be necessary to enable the airworthiness
certification of such aircraft under the Federal Aviation Act to be
maintained in good standing at all times;   (j) continue to use and operate
the Slots, Routes and all other Transferred Assets used and operated by

transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) TWA shall provide prompt written
notice to Purchaser of any change in any of the information contained in the
representations and warranties made by TWA in Article VI hereof or any

operate to cure any breach of the representations and warranties made by TWA
in Article VI hereof or any exhibits or schedules referred to herein or
attached hereto.   8.4 No Inconsistent Action. Neither Purchaser nor TWA
shall take any  ---------------------- action which is materially
inconsistent with its obligations under this Agreement, and TWA shall cause
the other Sellers to refrain from taking any such action.   8.5

-------------------------- shall use reasonable best efforts with due
diligence and in good faith to satisfy promptly all conditions required
hereby to be satisfied by such party in order to expedite the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.   33    8.6 Filings. As promptly as
practicable after the execution of this  ------- Agreement, each party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, and to cooperate with the other
party in obtaining, all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of any
Governmental Authority that may be or become necessary in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to take
all reasonable actions to avoid the entry of any order or decree by any
Governmental Authority prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including without limitation, the notifications required
to be filed by it under the HSR Act, and shall furnish to the other all such
information in its possession as may be necessary for the completion of the
notifications to be filed by the other; provided that, in complying with this
Section 8.6, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates  ----------- shall
be required to (i) divest any assets or discontinue or modify any of
its operations or (ii) accept or become subject to any condition or
requirement unacceptable to Purchaser in its sole discretion. No party shall
withdraw any such filing or submission prior to the termination of this
Agreement without the written consent of the other parties. Purchaser and TWA
agree that the filing fee required to be paid in connection with the filing
under any regulatory filings (including without limitation under the HSR Act)
shall be paid by Purchaser and divided equally between Purchaser and TWA by
subtracting TWA\'s half of such filing fees from the Purchase Price in
accordance with Section 4.7.  -----------   8.7 All Reasonable Efforts.
Subject to the terms and conditions herein  ---------------------- provided,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done as promptly

laws and regulations to consummate and make effective as promptly
as practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the prompt preparation by Sellers of all pleadings,

Assurances. From time to time following the Closing, TWA 
------------------ shall, and shall cause the other Sellers to, execute,
acknowledge and deliver such additional documents, instruments of conveyance,
transfer and assignment or assurances and take such other action as Purchaser
may reasonably request to more effectively assign, convey and transfer to
Purchaser, and fully vest title in Purchaser, with respect to the Transferred
Assets.   8.9 Publicity. The parties hereto shall consult with each other
and shall  --------- mutually agree (the agreement of each party not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) upon the content and timing of any press
release or other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation and agreement,
except as may be required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any securities exchange or any stock exchange
regulations as advised by counsel; provided, however, that each party shall
give prior notice to the other parties of the content and timing of any such
press release or other public statement required by   34   applicable law
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any securities
exchange or any stock exchange regulations.   8.10 Acquisition Proposals;
Recapitalization Transaction. From the date 
--------------------------------------------------- hereof until the earlier
of (a) the termination hereof or (b) the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases (in
which event the provisions of Section 8.11 shall govern),  ------------ and
except as expressly permitted by the following provisions of this Section 
------- 8.10, TWA shall not, nor shall it permit any of the other Sellers to,
nor shall ---- it authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of
or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or any
representative of any Seller to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal or (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided,
however, that nothing contained in this Section 8.10 shall prohibit the Board
of Directors of TWA from furnishing ------------ information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, any person that makes an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if, and only to the extent that, (A)
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, or (B) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Recapitalization Transaction and (C) prior
to taking such action, TWA (x) provides reasonable notice to Purchaser to the
effect that it is taking such action and (y) receives from such person
an executed confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form. Prior
to providing any information to or entering into discussions or negotiations
with any person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by such person,
TWA shall notify Purchaser of any Acquisition Proposal (including, without
limitation, the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the
person making it) as promptly as practicable after its receipt thereof, and
shall provide Purchaser with a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal or
amendments or supplements thereto, and shall thereafter inform Purchaser on a
prompt basis of the status of any discussions or negotiations with such a
third party, and any material changes to the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly give Purchaser a copy of any
information delivered to such Person which has not previously been reviewed
by Purchaser. Following the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, this
Section 8.10 shall be of no further force and  ------------ effect and the
solicitation and acceptance of competing offers (including Acquisition
Proposals) shall be governed by Section 8.11 and by order of the 
------------ Bankruptcy Court.   8.11 Bankruptcy Court Approval. 
-------------------------   (a) On or before two Business Days after the
commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, TWA shall, and shall cause the other
Chapter 11 Sellers to, file a motion or motions with the Bankruptcy Court
seeking entry of (i) the Approval Order (as defined in Section 8.11(d))
approving, inter alia, the sale  --------------- ----- ---- of the
Transferred Assets to Purchaser pursuant to sections 363 and 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code, subject to higher and better offers and (ii) an order
in substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (with such
changes  --------- thereto as Purchaser shall approve or request in its sole
discretion, the "Sale Procedures Order"), (A) approving the Termination
Amount and the Bankruptcy Termination Amount and providing that, in the event
the obligation of Seller to pay Purchaser either the Termination Amount or
the Bankruptcy Termination Amount arises,   35   such obligation shall
constitute a superpriority administrative expense under sections 503(b) and
507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code and shall be payable in accordance with the
provisions of Section 12.1 or Section 12.2 without further  ------------
------------ order of the Bankruptcy Court, (B) establishing procedures and
deadlines for the submission of competing offers, including, without
limitation, that (1) a competing offer, whether a proposed Recapitalization
Transaction or a proposed purchase or other disposition of the Transferred
Assets (collectively, a "Competing Offer"), shall not be considered to be a
higher and better offer unless, at a minimum, such offer provides for
aggregate consideration of at least $85,000,000 in excess of the Purchase
Price (with respect to the initial round of bidding) and of at least
$20,000,000 in excess of the aggregate consideration contained in such
bidder\'s prior Competing Offer (with respect to each subsequent round of
bidding, if any) and is otherwise a Superior Proposal, (2) a Competing Offer
must be accompanied by a good faith cash deposit of at least $50,000,000, (3)
Purchaser shall be entitled at its option to match such Competing Offer or
make a revised offer following such Competing Offer and (4) Purchaser shall
be entitled to credit bid the amount of the Bankruptcy Termination Amount
against any revised offer Purchaser may make following such Competing Offer,
and (C) scheduling a hearing to consider entry of the Approval Order and
providing that notice of such hearing be given to all of Sellers\' creditors
and interest holders of record and published in the Wall Street Journal
(National Edition). Purchaser and Sellers agree to make promptly any filings,
to take all actions and to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain entry
of the Sale Procedures Order, entry of the Approval Order and any and
all other approvals and orders necessary or appropriate for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) Prior to entry of the
Approval Order, TWA and Purchaser shall, and TWA shall cause the other
Chapter 11 Sellers to, accurately inform the Bankruptcy Court of all material
facts of which they are aware relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.   (c) If the Approval Order, Sale Procedures Order or
any other orders of the Bankruptcy Court relating to this Agreement shall be
appealed by any Person (or a petition for certiorari or motion for rehearing
or reargument shall  ---------- be filed with respect thereto), TWA agrees
to, and shall cause the other Chapter 11 Sellers to, take all steps as may be
reasonable and appropriate to defend against such appeal, petition or motion,
and Purchaser agrees to cooperate in such efforts, and each party hereto
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain an expedited resolution
of such appeal; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude the
parties hereto from consummating the transactions contemplated herein if the
Approval Order shall have been entered and has not been stayed and Purchaser,
in its sole discretion, waives in writing the requirement that the Approval
Order be a Final Order.   (d) Prior to Closing, the sale of the Transferred
Assets to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall have been approved by order of the
Bankruptcy Court pursuant to sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code,
pursuant to an order in substantially the form attached   36   hereto as
Exhibit D (with such changes thereto as Purchaser shall approve or 
--------- request in its sole discretion, the "Approval Order"), and the
Approval Order shall have become a Final Order. Purchaser and TWA agree to
use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Bankruptcy Court to enter an
Approval Order which contains, among other provisions reasonably requested by
Purchaser, the following provisions (it being understood that certain of such
provisions may be contained in either the findings of fact or conclusions of
law to be made by the Bankruptcy Court as part of the Approval Order): (i)
the transfers of the Transferred Assets by Sellers to Purchaser (A) are or
will be legal, valid and effective transfers of the Transferred Assets; (B)
vest or will vest Purchaser with all right, title and interest of Sellers in
and to the Transferred Assets free and clear of all Liens (other than
Permitted Liens) and claims (as defined in section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy
Code) pursuant to section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code (other than Liens
created by Purchaser) whatsoever known or unknown including, but not limited
to, any of Sellers\' creditors, vendors, suppliers, employees or lessors and
that Purchaser shall not be liable in any way (as successor entity or
otherwise) for any claims that any of the foregoing or any other third party
may have against any of the Sellers, the business of Sellers and the
Transferred Assets and permanently enjoins and restrains the assertion and
prosecution of any claims against Purchaser, Purchaser\'s Affiliates and the
ownership, use and operation of the Transferred Assets, other than claims on
the account of Assumed Liabilities; and (C) constitute transfers for
reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration under the Bankruptcy
Code and the laws of the States of New York and Delaware; (ii) all amounts to
be paid to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement constitute superpriority
administrative expenses under sections 503(b) and 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy
Code and are immediately payable if and when the obligations of Sellers arise
under this Agreement, without any further order of the Bankruptcy Court;
provided, however, that Sellers shall have the right to contest the validity
and amount of such asserted claims; (iii) all Persons are enjoined from
taking any action against Purchaser, Purchaser\'s Affiliates (as they existed
immediately prior to the Closing) or the Sellers to recover any claim which
such Person has solely against Sellers or any of Sellers\' Affiliates (as
they existed immediately following the Closing); (iv) the Bankruptcy Court
retains exclusive jurisdiction through the Bankruptcy Resolution Date to
interpret, construe and enforce the provisions of this Agreement, the Sale
Procedures Order and the Approval Order in all respects; provided, however,
that in the event the Bankruptcy Court abstains from exercising or declines
to exercise jurisdiction with respect to any matter provided for in this
clause (iv) or is without jurisdiction, such abstention, refusal or lack of
jurisdiction shall have no effect upon and shall not control, prohibit or
limit the exercise of jurisdiction of any other court having competent
jurisdiction with respect to any such matter; (v) the provisions of the
Approval Order are nonseverable and mutually dependent; (vi) the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are undertaken by Purchaser and Sellers at
arm\'s length, without collusion and in good faith within the meaning of
section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, and such parties are entitled to
the protections of section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, (vii) not selling
the Transferred Assets free and clear of liens and claims would impact
adversely on Sellers\' bankruptcy estates; (viii) a sale of the Transferred
Assets other than one free and clear of liens and claims would be of
substantially less benefit to the estate of the Sellers; (ix) Sellers may
assign and transfer to Purchaser all of Sellers\' right, title and interest
(including common   37   law rights) to all of their intangible property;
(x) approves the Sellers\' assignment of the Assumed Contracts pursuant to
sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and orders Sellers to pay any
cure amounts payable to the other parties to the Assumed Contracts from the
Purchase Price proceeds; (xi) provides for the retention of jurisdiction by
the Bankruptcy Court to resolve any and all disputes that may arise under
this Agreement as between Sellers and Purchaser, and further to hear and
determine any and all disputes between Sellers and/or Purchaser, as the case
may be, and any non-Sellers party to, among other things, any Assumed
Contracts, concerning inter alia, Sellers\' assignment thereof to  -----
---- Purchaser under this Agreement and any non-Seller\'s claims arising
under any agreements relating to Retained Liabilities; and (xii) pursuant to
section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, provides for the exemption of the
transactions contemplated herein from certain taxes, provides for the waiver
of so-called "bulk-sale" laws in all necessary jurisdictions, and provides
that the transactions contemplated herein are deemed to be under or in
contemplation of a plan to be confirmed under section 1129 of the Bankruptcy
Code.   (e) TWA shall, and shall cause the other Chapter 11 Sellers
to, cooperate reasonably with Purchaser and its representatives in connection
with the Approval Order, the Sale Procedures Order and the bankruptcy
proceedings in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include, but not
be limited to, consulting with Purchaser at Purchaser\'s reasonable request
concerning the status of such proceedings and providing Purchaser with copies
of requested pleadings, notices, proposed orders and other documents relating
to such proceedings as soon as reasonably practicable prior to any submission
thereof to the Bankruptcy Court. Sellers further covenant and agree that the
terms of any plan submitted by Sellers to the Bankruptcy Court for
confirmation shall not conflict with, supersede, abrogate, nullify, modify or
restrict the terms of this Agreement and the rights of Purchaser hereunder,
or in any way prevent or interfere with the consummation or performance of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including, without
limitation, any transaction that is contemplated by or approved pursuant to
the Approval Order and the Sale Procedures Order.   8.12 Specific
Enforcement of Covenants. Sellers acknowledge that 
--------------------------------- irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the covenants and agreements of Sellers set forth in this Article
VIII or in any other part of this Agreement were not timely performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that Purchaser shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent or cure any breach of such covenants and agreements of
Sellers and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at law or
in equity, it being understood that, after commencement of the Chapter 11
Cases, the Bankruptcy Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over such
matters; provided, however, that in the event the Bankruptcy Court abstains
from exercising or declines to exercise jurisdiction with respect to any
matter provided for in this sentence or is without jurisdiction,
such abstention, refusal or lack of jurisdiction shall have no effect upon
and shall not control, prohibit or limit the exercise of jurisdiction of any
other court having competent jurisdiction with respect to any such
matter.   38    8.13 Due Diligence. Purchaser shall use its reasonable
best efforts to  ------------- complete its due diligence review of the
Transferred Assets as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than
fifteen (15) days after receipt by Purchaser of the last Schedule to be
delivered by TWA as set forth on Exhibit B  --------- (other than the
completion of Phase I environmental assessments and additional nonintrusive
environmental due diligence on all Transferred Assets, which shall be
completed no later than 45 days after such receipt).   8.14 TWA Rights Plan.
TWA shall take all necessary actions to amend or  --------------- terminate
that certain Rights Agreement, dated as of December 19, 1995, between TWA and
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as Rights Agent, such that
the provisions of such agreement are not applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby or to the Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof and so that
Purchaser has no obligation whatsoever with respect to such agreement,
whether before or after the Closing (the "Rights Plan Amendment").   8.15
Aircraft Inspection Rights. Purchaser shall have the right to conduct 
-------------------------- an inspection of the Owned Aircraft and Leased
Aircraft as would be required in connection with the performance of a "B"
maintenance check of the aircraft under Purchaser\'s approved maintenance
program, including the right to open those sealed items, including any sealed
bays, panels or doors, which would be required to be opened during such "B"
check (but not to open any other sealed items, except as would be so required
during such "B" check), and to inspect (in such manner consistent with a "B"
check level inspection) those parts, components, and structures behind such
sealed items (i) which would be required to be inspected during such "B"
check or (ii) whose maintenance condition would be otherwise immediately
apparent during the course of such required inspection. Purchaser shall have
customary rights for an acceptance flight of the aircraft. Purchaser shall
also have the right to borescope the engines to the same extent as would be
required in connection with the performance of a "B" maintenance check of the
aircraft under Purchaser\'s approved maintenance program.   8.16
Designations. If Purchaser designates any Aircraft Lease or Gate 
------------ Lease as a Designated Aircraft Lease or a Designated Gate Lease,
respectively, Purchaser shall not purchase, lease or otherwise obtain a
direct or indirect interest in the aircraft or gate underlying such lease
during the period commencing on the date such lease is designated as a
Designated Aircraft Lease or a Designated Gate Lease and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date.   8.17 Marketing Agreements. Purchaser and
TWA shall promptly negotiate in  -------------------- good faith agreements
between them regarding accrual of AAdvantage frequent flyer miles on TWA
flights and reciprocal airport lounge access.   ARTICLE IX   POST-CLOSING
COVENANTS   9.1 Maintenance of Books and Records. Sellers and Purchaser
shall  -------------------------------- preserve until the seventh
anniversary of the Closing Date (or, with respect to any Sellers, until  
39   such time as such Seller is liquidated) all records possessed by such
party relating to the assets, liabilities or operations of the Transferred
Assets prior to the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, where there is a
legitimate purpose, such party shall provide the other party with access,
upon prior reasonable written request specifying the need therefor, during
regular business hours, to (i) the relevant officers and employees of such
party and (ii) the books of account and records of such party, but, in each
case, only to the extent relating to the assets, liabilities and operations
of the Transferred Assets prior to the Closing Date, and the other party and
its representatives shall have the right to make copies of such books and
records; provided, however, that the foregoing right of access shall not be
exercisable in such a manner as to interfere unreasonably with the normal
operations and business of such party; and further provided that, as to so
much of such information as constitutes trade secrets or confidential
business information of such party, the requesting party and its
representatives shall use due care to not disclose such information except
(i) as required by Law, (ii) with the prior written consent of such party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or (iii) where such
information becomes available to the public generally, or becomes generally
known to competitors of such party, through sources other than the requesting
party and its representatives. Such records may nevertheless be destroyed by
a party if such party sends the other party written notice of its intent to
destroy records, specifying with particularity the contents of the records to
be destroyed. Such records may then be destroyed after the 30th day following
delivery of such notice unless the other party objects to the destruction, in
which case the party seeking to destroy the records shall either agree to
retain such records or to deliver such records to the objecting party.   9.2
Right of Subrogation. In connection with Purchaser\'s right of 
-------------------- subrogation pursuant to Section 2.1(ix), upon the
written request of Purchaser,  --------------- TWA shall, and shall cause
each other Seller to, cooperate with Purchaser in connection with any action
or proceeding by Purchaser (whether or not in the name of any such Seller) to
enforce any such subrogation right.   9.3 Confidentiality. Each party hereto
acknowledges that the other  --------------- parties have legitimate and
continuing proprietary interests in the protection of their confidential
information and that the parties have invested substantial sums and will
continue to invest substantial sums to develop, maintain and protect such
confidential information. Prior to and after the Closing, each party agrees
not to disclose, furnish or make accessible to anyone or use for its own
benefit (other than as contemplated hereby) any trade secrets or
other confidential or proprietary information of another party relating to
any Seller, Purchaser and/or their respective businesses or the other parties
including, but not limited to, information obtained by or revealed to such
party during any investigations, negotiations or review relating to this
Agreement and any other document contemplated hereby or thereby or any past
or future actions taken in connection with, pursuant to, in accordance with,
or under this Agreement, including without limitation any business plans,
marketing plans, financial information, strategies, systems, programs,
methods and computer programs; provided, however, that such protected
information shall not include (i) information required to be disclosed by
law, legal or judicial process (including a court order, subpoena or order of
a Governmental Authority) or the rules of any stock   40   exchange,
(ii) information that is or becomes available to the disclosing party on a
non- confidential basis from a source other than the other parties and
not obtained in violation of this Agreement and (iii) information known to
the public or otherwise in the public domain without violation of this
Section 9.3; provided, further, that this Section 9.3 shall not in any way
limit the disclosure of information by TWA (a) in connection with the
commencement and prosecution of the Chapter 11 Cases or (b) regarding TWA (i)
to other bidders or potential bidders to the extent specifically permitted by
this Agreement or (ii) following the termination of this Agreement.  
ARTICLE X   EMPLOYEE MATTERS   10.1 Hiring Obligations. Upon the
occurrence of the Closing, Purchaser  ------------------ shall (i) offer all
of Sellers\' union employees (all of whom are listed on Schedule 10.1(a))
(other than personnel who (A) have previously been
terminated ----------------- by Purchaser or an entity controlled by
Purchaser or (B) would not be qualified for employment under Purchaser\'s
general hiring policies as in effect at Closing) employment by Purchaser or
one or more entities controlled by Purchaser at compensation levels
substantially equivalent to those currently enjoyed by similarly situated
employees of Purchaser or such controlled entity, (ii) offer employment to
certain members of TWA\'s executive management and those non-union employees
listed on Schedule 10.1(b) on a case-by-case basis at Purchaser\'s sole 
---------------- discretion and (iii) provide employment benefits and post-
retirement benefits to all employees actually hired by Purchaser pursuant to
(i) and (ii) above at levels substantially no less favorable than those
benefits provided to Purchaser\'s similarly situated employees. Any Seller
employees to be hired by Purchaser or an entity controlled by Purchaser in
accordance with this Section  ------- 10.1 will be hired in accordance with
terms and conditions established by ---- Purchaser or such entity (and,
where applicable, in accordance with and pursuant to collective bargaining
agreements relating to employees of Purchaser or such controlled entity).  
10.2 Union Matters. All offers of employment made by Purchaser in accordance
with Section 10.1(i) above and all benefits to be provided pursuant 
--------------- to Section 10.1(iii) above will be conditioned on acceptance
by all such  ----------------- employees of Purchaser\'s work rules then in
effect and in effect after the Closing Date from time to time that are
generally applicable to similarly situated employees of Purchaser. Purchaser
and Sellers agree to encourage their respective unions to negotiate in good
faith to resolve fair and equitable seniority integration. Prior to Closing,
TWA shall amend all existing Collective Bargaining Agreements relating to any
present or former employee of TWA to provide that (i) scope, successorship,
and benefits provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreements are not
applicable to or being assumed by Purchaser as part of or as the result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Article X will not violate or breach in any
manner any provision of any Collective Bargaining Agreement (collectively,
the "CBA Amendments").    41    10.3 Treatment of Pension Plans.

AND CONCLUDES THAT:   1. The findings and conclusions set forth herein
constitute the Court\'s findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to
Fed. R. Bark. Proc. 70.52, made applicable to this proceeding pursuant to
Fed. R. Bankr. Proc. 9014.   2. To the extent any of the following findings
of fact constitute coclusions of law, they are adopted as such. To the extent
any of the following conclusions of law constitute findings of act, they are
adopted as such.     3 . Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement.  
4. Notice of the Motion, the Auction, and the Hearing has been given
in accordance with Fed. R. Bankr Proc. 2002 and 6004, the Sale Procedures

entitled to the protections of section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code.

Contracts is based on the reasonable exercise of the Debtors\' business
judgment and is in the best interests of the Debtors\' estates.   12.

deliberation, the Court ORDERS, ADJUDGES,  AND DECREES THAT:   1. The

free and clear of Liens (other than Liens created by Purchaser) pursuant to
section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code whatsoever known or unknown including,
but not limited to, any of the Sellers\' creditors, vendors, suppliers,
employees or lessors and that Purchaser shall not be liable in any way (as
successor entity or otherwise) for any claims that any of the foregoing or
any other third party may have against any   of the Sellers, provided
further that, with regard to employees\' claims, the free and clear delivery
of the Assets shall include, but not be limited to, all asserted or
unasserted, known or unknown, employment related claims, payroll taxes,

Sellers and successorship liability, with any and all valid and
enforceable Liens thereon, including those asserted by Sellers\' secured
lenders, to be transferred, affixed, and attached to the net proceeds of such
sale, with the same validity, priority, force, and effect as such Liens had
upon the Transferred Assets immediately prior to the Closing.   5. Subject
to the payment by Purchaser to Sellers pursuant to sections 363 and 365(a) of
the Bankruptcy Code of the consideration provided for in the Agreement, the
sale of the Transferred Assets by Sellers to Purchaser shall constitute a
legal, valid, and effective transfer of the Transferred Assets and shall vest
Purchaser with all right, title, and interest of Sellers in and to the
Transferred Assets free and clear of all Liens pursuant to section 363(f) of
the Bankruptcy Code, effective as of the Closing.   6. The sale of the
Transferred Assets to Purchaser under the Agreement  will constitute
transfers for reasonably equivalent value and fair  consideration under the
Bankruptcy Code and the laws of the States of New York  and Delaware.   7.

faith purchaser under section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code.   8. All

of  the Court; provided, however, that Sellers shall have the right to
contest the  -------- -------  validity and amount of such asserted
claims.    9. Pursuant to sections 105(a) and 363 of the Bankruptcy Code,
all Persons are hereby enjoined from taking any action against Purchaser
or Purchaser\'s Affiliates (as they existed immediately prior to the Closing)
to recover any claim which such Person has solely against Sellers or
Sellers\' Affiliates (as they exist immediately following the Closing).  
10. Sellers are authorized to assign and transfer to Purchaser all
of Sellers\' rights, title and interest (including common law rights) to all
of Sellers\' intangible property to be assigned and transferred to Purchaser
under the Agreement.   11. All objections and responses concerning the Sale

forth in the record of the Hearing and to the extent any such objection or
response was not otherwise withdrawn, waived, or settled, they are and all
reservations and rights therein, are overruled and denied.   12. Purchaser
has not assumed or otherwise become obligated for any of Sellers\'
liabilities other than as set forth in Section 3.1 of the Agreement, and
Purchaser has not purchased any of the Excluded Assets. Consequently,
all holders of Retained Liabilities against the Sellers are hereby enjoined

or other than pursuant to this Order. All persons having any interest in the
Excluded Assets are hereby enjoined from asserting or prosecuting any claim

Contracts is approved pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.   14.
The Sellers shall pay any cure amounts payable to the other parties to the

the Agreement.   Purchaser shall assume obligations of the Sellers arising
from and after the Closing under the Assumed Contracts and shall not assume
any obligation other than the Assumed Contracts accruing thereunder prior to
the Closing. Upon assumption and assignment of any Assumed Contract, the
Sellers and the estates shall be relieved of any liability for breach of such
Assumed Contract occurring after such assignment pursuant to section 365(k)
of the Bankruptcy Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall remain
obligated to reimburse Purchaser for any amounts payable under any Assumed
Contract after the Closing.   15. Purchaser has provided adequate assurance
of its future performance under the Assumed Contracts and the proposed
assumption and assignment of the Assumed Contracts satisfies the requirements
of the Bankruptcy Code including, inter alia, sections 365(b)(1) and (3) and
365(f) to the extent applicable.   16. The Assumed Contracts are valid and
binding, in full force and effect, and enforceable in accordance with their
terms.   17. There shall be no rent accelerations, assignment fees,
increases, or any other fees charged to Purchaser as a result of the

any Seller and another party to an Assumed Contract regarding the payment of
the "cure" amount.    18. All parties to the Assumed Contracts are forever
barred and enjoined from raising or asserting against Purchaser any
assignment fee, default or breach under, or any claim or pecuniary loss, or
condition to assignment, arising under or related to the Assumed Contracts
existing as of the Closing or arising by reason of the Closing.   19. The

the provisions of this   Order, and, pursuant to section 365(k) of the
Bankruptcy Code, Sellers shall be relieved from any further liability, except
for any cure obligations as herein provided.   20. Pursuant to sections

respective Seller thereto shall be effected by this Order.   21. The

any amendments and modification of such Assumed Contracts, constitute the
Assumed Contracts that are being assumed by and assigned to Purchaser by the
Seller party thereto.   22. Purchaser shall not be liable for any claims of
the lessors or contract parties under the Assumed Contracts in respect of any
claim or breach of an Assumed Contract that accrued prior to Closing.   23.
This Order shall be effective and enforceable immediately upon entry and its
provisions shall be self-executing.   24. The obligations of Sellers
relating to Taxes shall be fulfilled by Sellers   25. This Court shall
retain exclusive jurisdiction through the Bankruptcy Resolution Date to
interpret and enforce the provisions of the Agreement, the Sale Procedures
Order, and this Order in all respects and further to hear and determine any
and all disputes between Sellers and/or Purchaser, as the case may be, and
any non-Sellers party to, among other things, any Assumed Contracts
