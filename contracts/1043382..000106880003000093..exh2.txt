                                CONSIDERATION

                  Section 2.1. Amount and Form of Consideration. The
                               --------------------------------
consideration to be paid by Purchaser and the Subsidiary Purchasers to
Seller in consideration of the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets
shall consist of:

                  (a) U.S.$500 million (the "CASH CONSIDERATION"), subject
to adjustment as set forth in Section 2.3, to be paid in the manner and at
the time set forth in Section 2.2; and

                  (b) the assumption on and as of the Closing Date of the
Assumed Liabilities.

                  Section 2.2. Payment of Consideration. At the Closing, the
                               ------------------------
Cash Consideration, plus any applicable value added Tax, goods and services
Tax or similar Tax (collectively, "VAT") imposed on, or required to be
remitted by, Seller or applicable Subsidiary or Subsidiaries as a result of
the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in U.S. Dollars to an account designated by
Seller, such designation to be made in writing at least three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date (provided, that, except as otherwise required by
                           --------
applicable Law, the parties shall treat the sale and purchase of the
Purchased Shares as not being subject to VAT). Seller shall have the right
to direct that all or part of any payment due to it hereunder be made
directly to one or more of its Subsidiaries that are conveying Purchased
Shares or Purchased Assets hereunder; provided, however, that no such
                                      --------  -------
direction shall relieve Seller of any of its responsibilities hereunder. Any
such payment by Purchaser (or any Subsidiary of Purchaser designated
pursuant to Section 2.5) shall be a good discharge of its obligations under
this Section 2.2 and neither Purchaser nor any such Subsidiary shall be
obligated to see to the application of any funds so paid.

                  Section 2.3. Purchase Price Adjustment.
                               -------------------------

                  (a) Within 90 calendar days following the Closing Date,
Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared (including in connection
therewith conducting a physical inventory in accordance with Seller's past
practices), and deliver to Purchaser a balance sheet of the Business
(including all Delayed Transfer Assets) as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (assuming there will be no Subsequent Closings) (as such may be
adjusted following resolution of disputes in accordance with Section 2.3(c),
the "CLOSING DATE BALANCE SHEET"). The Closing Date Balance Sheet will be
prepared in accordance with GAAP using the same accounting principles,
procedures, policies and methods that were employed in preparing the
Benchmark Balance Sheet (true and correct copies of such specific
principles, procedures, policies and methods, as they have been applied to
the Business, have been Made Available to Purchaser). Based on the Closing
Date Balance Sheet and this Section 2.3, Seller shall prepare a certificate
setting forth a calculation of Closing Cash and of the Net Asset Value of
the Business as of the Closing Date (the "CLOSING NET ASSET VALUE"). Seller
shall also cause to be prepared and shall deliver to Purchaser at the same
time as the foregoing an audit report of Deloitte & Touche LLP, Seller's
independent public accountants, stating that the Closing Date Balance Sheet
was prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and presents
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Business as
of the Closing Date.

                  (b) During the preparation of the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and the calculation of Closing Cash and Closing Net Asset Value, and
the period of any dispute within the contemplation of this Section 2.3,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to: (i) provide
Seller and Seller's authorized representatives with reasonable access to the
books, records, facilities and employees of the Acquired Companies and the
Purchased Assets; and (ii) cooperate fully with Seller and Seller's
authorized representatives, including by providing on a timely basis all
information necessary or useful in the calculation of Closing Cash and
Closing Net Asset Value. Such access and cooperation shall be provided in
accordance with the terms of Section 7.4, and Seller and Purchaser shall
bear in equal proportion any direct costs associated with Purchaser's
provision of such access and cooperation.

                  (c) After receipt of the calculation of Closing Cash and
Closing Net Asset Value and the workpapers used in the preparation thereof,
Purchaser shall have 20 Business Days to review the calculation of Closing
Cash and Closing Net Asset Value and such workpapers. Purchaser and its
authorized representatives shall have reasonable access to all relevant
books and records and employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries to the extent
reasonably required to complete their review of the calculation of Closing
Cash and Closing Net Asset Value. Purchaser may dispute items reflected in
the calculation of Closing Cash and Closing Net Asset Value only on the
basis that such amounts were not determined in conformity with GAAP applied
by Seller on a consistent basis or contain arithmetic error. Unless
Purchaser delivers written notice to Seller on or prior to the 20th Business
Day after Purchaser's receipt of the calculation of Closing Cash and Closing
Net Asset Value specifying in reasonable detail the amount, nature and basis
of all disputed items, Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed
to the calculation of Closing Cash and Closing Net Asset Value. If Purchaser
so notifies Seller of its objection to the calculation of Closing Cash or
Closing Net Asset Value, Purchaser and Seller shall, within 30 calendar days
following such notice (the "RESOLUTION PERIOD"), attempt to resolve their
differences and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be
final, binding and conclusive. If following resolution of any disputed
amounts there do not remain in dispute amounts the aggregate net effect of
which would result in an adjustment to Cash Consideration under Section
2.3(e) in excess of U.S.$1 million, then all amounts remaining in dispute
shall be deemed to have been resolved in favor of the calculation of Closing
Cash and Closing Net Asset Value delivered by Seller to Purchaser.

                  (d) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, the
net effect of all amounts remaining in dispute would result in an adjustment
to Cash Consideration under Section 2.3 in excess of U.S.$1 million, then
all amounts remaining in dispute shall be submitted to KPMG LLP (the
"NEUTRAL AUDITORS") within ten calendar days after the expiration of the
Resolution Period. Each party agrees to execute, if requested by the Neutral
Auditors, a reasonable engagement letter, including customary indemnities.
All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the
Neutral Auditors shall be borne pro rata as between Seller on the one hand
and Purchaser on the other, in proportion to the allocation of the dollar
amount of the amounts remaining in dispute between Seller and Purchaser made
by the Neutral Auditors such that the prevailing party pays the lesser
proportion of the fees and expenses. The Neutral Auditors shall act as an
arbitrator to determine, based solely on the provisions of this Section 2.3
and the presentations by Seller and Purchaser, and not by independent
review, only those issues still in dispute and only as to whether such
amounts were arrived at in conformity with GAAP and Section 2.3(a). The
Neutral Auditors' determination shall be made within 30 calendar days

                                     8

of their selection, shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to
Seller and Purchaser and shall be final, binding and conclusive. The term
"FINAL CLOSING CASH" shall mean the definitive Closing Cash and the term
"FINAL CLOSING NET ASSET VALUE" shall mean the definitive Closing Net Asset
Value, in each case, as agreed to (or deemed to be agreed to) by Purchaser
and Seller in accordance with the terms of Section 2.3(c) or resulting from
the determinations made by the Neutral Auditors in accordance with this
Section 2.3(d) (in addition to those items theretofore agreed to by Seller
and Purchaser).

                  (e) The Cash Consideration shall be (i)(A) increased
dollar for dollar to the extent that Final Closing Net Asset Value exceeds
105% of the Net Asset Value of the Business as of September 30, 2002, and
(B) decreased dollar for dollar to the extent that Final Closing Net Asset
Value is less than 95% of the Net Asset Value of the Business as of
September 30, 2002, and (ii)(A) increased dollar for dollar to the extent
that Final Closing Cash is greater than U.S.$0 and (B) decreased dollar for
dollar to the extent that Final Closing Cash is less than U.S.$0. Any
adjustments to the Cash Consideration made pursuant to this Section 2.3(e)
shall bear interest from the Closing Date through the date of payment at the
rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, N.A., in New York, New
York, from time to time as its prime rate. Any adjustments to the Cash
Consideration made pursuant to this Section 2.3(e), adjusted to reflect any
increase or decrease in applicable VAT for which Purchaser is responsible,
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
or accounts specified by Seller, if Seller is owed payment, or to the
account or accounts specified by Purchaser, if Purchaser is owed payment,
within five business days after the Final Closing Cash and Final Closing Net
Asset Value are agreed to by Purchaser and Seller or any remaining disputed
items are ultimately determined by the Neutral Auditors.

                  Section 2.4. Allocation of Purchase Price. Prior to the
                               ----------------------------
Closing Date Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to agree
upon a schedule (the "ALLOCATION SCHEDULE") allocating the Cash
Consideration and the Assumed Liabilities among the Purchased Shares and the
Purchased Assets. The Allocation Schedule shall be reasonable and shall be
prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder and Schedule 2.4. Each party agrees that,
                                       ------------
within 15 calendar days of finalizing the agreed Allocation Schedule, it
shall sign the Allocation Schedule and return an executed copy thereof to
the other party. Except as otherwise required by Law or pursuant to a
"determination" under Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law), Purchaser and Seller agree to
act in accordance with the allocations contained in the Allocation Schedule
for all Tax purposes and that neither of them will take any position
inconsistent therewith in any Tax Returns or similar filings (including IRS
Form 8594 (or any similar form required to be filed under state, local or
non-U.S. Law)), any refund claim, any litigation, or otherwise. Purchaser
and Seller each agree to provide the other party with any other information
required to complete IRS Form 8594. In the event that Purchaser and Seller
are unable to reach an agreement within 90 calendar days of the later of the
Closing Date and the date on which the last purchase price adjustment, if
any, is determined pursuant to Section 2.3, then any disputed items shall be
resolved within the next 30 calendar days by the Neutral Auditors, whose
fees shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller. Such determination by
the Neutral Auditors shall be binding on the parties without further

a Governmental Body under applicable Law that has not been received (such

CLOSING") with respect to Delayed Transfer Assets shall occur as soon as
practicable following receipt of the applicable approvals in each applicable
jurisdiction. At the applicable Subsequent Closing, Purchaser and Seller
shall make such deliveries as may be necessary under applicable Law with

account of Purchaser or the applicable Subsidiary Purchaser, and Purchaser
or the applicable Subsidiary Purchaser shall be liable for all obligations
relating to such Delayed Transfer Assets. To the extent that Seller is not

the account of Purchaser as contemplated by the preceding sentence, Seller
shall use all reasonable endeavors to enter into an arrangement that passes
through to Purchaser the economic costs and benefits of ownership of such
Delayed Transfer Assets. In connection therewith, the Business Employees in

or its Subsidiaries, and any provisions of Section 10.1 shall apply to such
Business Employees only as of the date of the applicable Subsequent Closing.

Transfer Asset, Seller shall take all reasonable endeavors to cause those
persons that Seller has designated to be directors (or the holders of an
equivalent office under the Law applicable to such entity) of Solutia GOM
India Coatings Materials Private Limited to be replaced, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing, with such persons as Purchaser
shall designate in writing to Seller.

the laws of each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the
ownership of its properties requires such qualification, authorization or

issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are not subject to any preemptive
or subscription rights (and were not issued in violation of any preemptive
or subscription rights). The Purchased Companies and/or Subsidiaries
concerned have good and valid title to all such shares or comparable equity

                               ---------------
Purchaser or its representatives pursuant hereto shall be held in accordance

issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement concerning
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser shall so
advise and cooperate with Seller and shall not release such information
without Seller's consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), unless (a) such information is otherwise publicly
available other than as a result of a disclosure by Purchaser made in breach
of this Section 7.2 or (b) the release thereof is, in the reasonable
judgment of Purchaser, required by any Law (including any rule of any

                                     --------
(b), that Purchaser shall take all reasonable endeavors to notify Seller
prior to making any such disclosure and shall restrict such disclosure to

                  Section 7.3. Consents and Conditions.
                               -----------------------

                  (a) Purchaser shall use all reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with Seller in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable, including, but not limited to: (i)
obtaining all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from, and giving any
necessary notifications to, third parties; (ii) making all registrations and
filings with, and obtaining all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers,
consents and approvals from, all Governmental Bodies (including those in
connection with the HSR Act and the EC Regulation) and using all reasonable
best efforts to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, a Governmental Body; (iii) responding to any information
requests from the European Commission and/or the United States as soon as
possible; and (iv) defending any Legal Proceedings challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order or
preliminary or permanent injunction entered by any Governmental Body vacated
or reversed. In furtherance of, and without in any way limiting, the
foregoing, Purchaser shall use all reasonable best efforts to avoid the
issuance of a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material
("SECOND REQUEST") under 15 U.S.C. Section 18a(e)(2) in the United States or
the issuance of a decision under Article 6(1)(c) of the EC Regulation
initiating a "Second Phase" investigation ("SECOND PHASE").

                  (b) Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing Seller with copies of
notices or other communications received by Purchaser or by any of its
Subsidiaries from any third party and/or any Governmental Body with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser and Seller shall each
promptly furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other party may request in connection with the foregoing
and shall each promptly provide counsel for the other party with copies of
all filings made by such party, and all correspondence between such party
(and its advisors) and any Governmental Body and any other information
supplied by such party and

such party's Affiliates to a Governmental Body in connection herewith and
the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that Purchaser and
                                      --------  -------
Seller may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other as "outside counsel
only," and materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Business and (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements. Materials designated as for "outside counsel only" and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel
to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Each party
shall, subject to applicable Law, permit counsel for the other party
reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith, the
views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Body. Purchaser and Seller agree not to
participate, or to permit their affiliates to participate, in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with
any Governmental Body in connection herewith and the transactions
contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other party in advance and,
to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Body, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate (in the case of Seller, as
an observer); provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be deemed to have
              --------  -------
breached this covenant if (A) Purchaser uses efforts reasonable under the
circumstances to contact Seller's designated representatives at Van Bael &
Bellis and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, but is nonetheless unable to
reach any such designated representatives prior to the time at which such
Governmental Body proposes to conduct such meeting or discussion or (B) any
such designated representatives are unable to participate in such meeting or
discussion at the proposed time.

                  (c) Purchaser shall take all reasonable endeavors to
ensure that the Subsequent Closings (if any) shall take place as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date and, in any event, no later than 90 days
after the Closing Date.

                  Section 7.4. Seller's Access to Documents. Purchaser
                               ----------------------------

Representatives, upon reasonable notice and without undue interruption to
Purchaser's business, access during normal business hours to the books and
records of the Business pertaining to the operations of the Business prior
to the Closing Date for a period of five years (or such longer period as may
necessary to enable Seller to comply with provisions of applicable Law)
following the Closing Date in connection with financial statements and U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission reporting obligations, Excluded
Liabilities, Excluded Assets and other reasonable business purposes provided
that nothing herein shall limit Seller's rights of discovery. Purchaser
agrees to hold all of the books and records of the Business existing on the
Closing Date or included in the Purchased Assets in accordance with
Purchaser's standard record retention policies provided that Purchaser shall
not destroy, alter or dispose of any of such books and records for a period
of ten years from the Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by
Law without first offering in writing at least 60 calendar days prior to
such destruction or disposition to surrender them to Seller.

                               ---------------
before, at or after the Closing, execute and deliver such instruments and
take such other actions as may reasonably be required to (a) carry out the
intent hereof and of the Separation Agreements and (b) consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the taking of all
acts necessary to

                                     34

promptly notify Seller of any known inaccuracy or breach in any warranty or
covenant of Seller or any circumstance or condition that could reasonably be
expected to constitute such a breach.

                  Section 7.6. Guaranties; Letters of Credit. Purchaser
                               -----------------------------
shall take all reasonable endeavors to cause itself or one or more of its
Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries that is not an Acquired Company, effective as of the Closing
Date, in respect of all obligations of Seller and any such Subsidiary that
is not an Acquired Company under each of the guaranties, letters of credit,
letters of comfort, bid bonds and performance bonds obtained by Seller or
any its Subsidiaries that is not an Acquired Company for the benefit of the
Business, which guaranties, letters of credit, letters of comfort, bid bonds

Closing cease to have any obligation whatsoever arising from or in
connection with the Guaranties.

Purchaser's name and mark and shall remove and cease to mark products and
other property with the names, marks or other indicia of "Solutia,"
Santotec, Phos-Check, Butvar, Saflex, Vanceva, Dequest, the Solutia logo or
other similar mark; provided, however, that for a period of six months
                    --------  -------
following the Closing Date, Purchaser may continue to use or dispose of any
inventory product specifications, manuals and other accompanying materials,
and packaging and shipping materials that bear the mark "Solutia," Santotec,
Phos-Check, Butvar, Saflex, Vanceva, Dequest, the Solutia logo or other
similar mark, in a manner consistent with that employed immediately prior to
the Closing, and (b) it shall not advertise or hold itself out as Seller or
an Affiliate thereof after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall take all
reasonable endeavors to cause the names of all applicable Acquired Companies
to be changed to delete any references to "Solutia" from such names as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date.

                  Section 7.8. Bulk Sales Law. Purchaser hereby waives
                               --------------

                          ---------------
         this Section 10.1: (A) effective as of the Closing, Seller shall
         cause the Acquired Companies to cease to sponsor or constitute a
         participating employer in all Employee Benefit Plans, other than
         the Acquired Company Plans; (B) Seller shall remain solely
         responsible for any and all Liabilities and obligations arising
         under, in connection with or in respect of the Seller Employee
         Benefit Plans, and all rights and entitlements of all current and
         former employees employed in connection with the Business under
         such plans (including the rights and entitlements of the
         Transferred Employees thereunder), and neither Purchaser nor any of
         its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Acquired
         Companies) shall have any responsibility or obligation in respect
         of any such plan; (C) effective as of the Closing, Purchaser and
         its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) shall be solely
         responsible for any and all Liabilities and obligations arising
         under, in connection with or in respect of the Acquired Company
         Plans, and all rights and entitlements of all current and former
         employees employed in connection with the Business under such plans
         (including the rights and entitlements of the Transferred
         Employees, Acquired Company Employees and Former Acquired Company
         Employees thereunder), and neither Seller nor any of its
         Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Companies) shall have any
         responsibility or obligation in respect of any such plan; and
         (D) from and after the Closing, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall
         honor all Acquired Company Plans in accordance with their terms as
         in effect immediately before the Closing, subject to any amendment
         or termination thereof that may be permitted by such terms (without
         prejudice to the provisions of Section 6.2(d)).

                      (ii) Post-Closing Benefits Generally. For a period of
                           -------------------------------
         not less than one year following the Closing, Purchaser shall
         provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Employee base
         compensation, incentive compensation and employee benefits
         (including

                                     39

         those resulting from letters of assignment and other agreements
         referred to in Section 10.1(f)(i)) that are no less favorable, when
         taken in the aggregate, than those that apply to such Employee
         immediately before the Closing. The foregoing shall not be
         construed to prevent the termination of employment of any Employee.
         It is acknowledged that Purchaser and its Subsidiaries are not able
         to provide stock options, stock purchase or other equity-based
         plans to Employees from and after the Closing, and no provision of
         this Section 10.1 shall be construed to require them to do so.

                      (iii) Welfare Benefits for Transferred Employees
                            ------------------------------------------
         Generally. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
         ---------
         provisions of Section 10.1: (A) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall
         be solely responsible for (I) claims for the welfare benefits and
         for workers' compensation, in each case that are incurred by or
         with respect to any Transferred Employee and reported before the
         Closing, (II) claims relating to health continuation coverage
         required by Section 601 et seq. of the Employee Retirement Income
                                 -- ---
         Security Act of 1974, as amended ("COBRA COVERAGE") attributable to
         "qualifying events" with respect to any Transferred Employee and
         his or her beneficiaries and dependents that occur upon or before
         the Closing, (III) claims for Welfare Benefits and for workers'
         compensation, in each case that are incurred by or with respect to
         any Business Employee who does not become a Transferred Employee,
         whether reported before, upon or after the Closing; and (IV) claims
         relating to COBRA Coverage attributable to "qualifying events" with
         respect to any Business Employee who does not become a Transferred
         Employee and his or her beneficiaries and dependents, whether
         occurring before, upon or after the Closing; and (ii) Purchaser and
         its Subsidiaries shall be solely responsible for (A) claims for
         Welfare Benefits and for workers compensation, in each case that
         are incurred by or with respect to any Transferred Employee and
         reported upon or after the Closing Date, and (B) claims relating to
         COBRA Coverage attributable to "qualifying events" with respect to
         any Transferred Employee and his or her beneficiaries and
         dependents that occur after the Closing.

                      (iv) Past Service Credit Generally. For all purposes
                           -----------------------------
         under the employee benefit plans of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
         providing benefits after the Closing to any Transferred Employees
         (the "NEW PLANS"), each such Transferred Employee shall be credited
         with his or her years of service with Seller and its Subsidiaries
         (including the Acquired Companies) before the Closing, to the same
         extent as such Transferred Employee was entitled, before the
         Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Employee
         Benefit Plans, ("PAST SERVICE CREDIT"), except (1) in the case of
         U.S Business Employees, for purposes of benefit accrual under New
         Plans that are defined benefit or cash balance pension plans,
         (2) as provided in Sections 10.1(c)(i) and 10.1(c)(iii), and (3) to
         the extent Past Service Credit would result in a duplication of
         benefits. For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no transfer of
         assets or liabilities from the Solutia pension plan in which U.S.
         Business Employees participate before the Closing to any plan
         sponsored by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries.

                  (c) Certain Pension Provisions.
                      --------------------------

                      (i) Pension Benefit Transfer for Certain European
                          ---------------------------------------------
         Business Employees. European Business Employees employed in Belgium
         ------------------
         and the United

         Kingdom shall be permitted to elect to have their pension assets
         and liabilities transferred from the applicable pension plan
         sponsored by Seller and its Affiliates to a plan or plans sponsored
         by Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries, in accordance with
         applicable Law and local custom and practice. The assets
         transferred for each such European Business Employee that so elects
         shall equal the amount of his or her liabilities so transferred, on
         a projected benefit obligation basis, determined in accordance with
         the actuarial assumptions set forth in Schedule 10.1(c)(i). Each
                                                -------------------
         such European Business Employee who does not elect to have his or
         her pension assets and liabilities so transferred shall be enrolled
         in the appropriate pension plan of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
         effective as of the Closing, but shall not be entitled to Past
         Service Credit for purposes of such pension plan.

                      (ii) Hoechst Pension Plans. Seller shall use its
                           ---------------------
         reasonable best efforts to procure that the Acquired Company
         Employees employed in Germany and Austria shall be permitted, from
         and after the Closing Date, to maintain their active membership of
         or become full active members of the Hoechst Pensionskasse der
         Mitarbeiter der Hoechst Gruppe (Germany), the Hoechst Sterbekasse
         (Germany) or the BVP-Pensionkasse (Austria), as applicable, on at
         least the same conditions as currently apply.

                      (iii) Other Business Employees. Any Other Business
                            ------------------------
         Employee employed in jurisdictions other than jurisdictions in
         which an Acquired Company is organized, the United States, the
         United Kingdom or Belgium, and who participates in a funded pension
         plan, shall be accorded, if allowed under local plan rules and
         applicable Law, the treatment accorded to the European Business
         Employees employed in Belgium and the United Kingdom, on terms to
         be agreed to by Seller and Purchaser. Seller and Purchaser agree to
         cooperate in good faith to implement the foregoing.

                  (d) Continuity of Benefits for U.S. and Other Business
                      --------------------------------------------------
Employees. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following
---------
shall apply with respect to the participation of each Transferred Employee
who is a U.S. Business Employee or an Other Business Employee in any New
Plans that Purchaser and its Subsidiaries choose to offer. Each such
Transferred Employee shall be eligible to participate effective as of the
Closing, without any waiting time, nor any pre-existing condition exclusions
or actively-at-work conditions (both for the Transferred Employee and
his/her dependents), in such New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan replaces coverage under a similar type of Employee Benefit Plan in
which such Transferred Employee currently participates (such plans,
collectively, the "OLD PLANS"). In addition, Purchaser shall cause each such
New Plan that provides medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or
disability benefits to recognize any eligible expenses incurred by any
Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents under the
corresponding Old Plan during 2003 but before the Closing, for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements for the remainder of 2003 under such New Plan.

                  (e) Delayed Commencement of Benefits. Notwithstanding the
                      --------------------------------
foregoing provisions of this Section 10.1, if it is not possible for
Purchaser to begin providing benefits to Other Business Employees under
plans sponsored by Purchaser and its Subsidiaries as of the

                                     41

Closing, the commencement of such benefits may be delayed past the Closing
to the extent and on terms and conditions to be agreed to in good faith by
Seller and Purchaser.

                  (f) International Assignments and Third Country Nationals.
                      -----------------------------------------------------
(i) Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall assume and be solely responsible
for, as of the Closing, all Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates with
respect to all letters of assignment and other agreements under which any
Employee is seconded from his or her home country to another country, to the
extent such letters and agreements have been Made Available to Purchaser.
(ii) Third country national employees shall be treated as set out in
Schedule 10.1(f)(ii).
--------------------

                  (g) Certain Compensation Obligations. Without limiting the
                      --------------------------------
generality of the foregoing provisions of Section 10.1, Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries shall (i) honor all entitlements of Transferred Employees to
vacation that has accrued but not been taken as of the Closing, except to
the extent required by applicable Law to be paid in cash, (ii) pay all
unpaid compensation of the Transferred Employees accrued through the
Closing, including without limitation salary, wages, annual bonuses for
years ended before the Closing, thirteenth-month bonuses and other bonuses
and incentive compensation, social security payments, and vacation pay
required by applicable Law to be paid in cash and (iii) pay annual bonus for
the year in which the Closing occurs to each Employee who is eligible to
receive an annual bonus under any Employee Benefit Plan and who meets the
service requirements to receive such a bonus, based upon service with Seller
and its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) before the Closing
and service with Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired
Companies) after the Closing. A pro-rata portion of the annual bonuses
described in clause (iii) of the preceding sentence (pro-rated based upon
the portion of 2003 that occurs before the Closing), shall be based upon the
applicable bonus plan of Seller and its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) and performance before the Closing, and the remainder shall be
based upon the applicable bonus plan of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
(including the Acquired Companies) and performance after the Closing. For
the avoidance of doubt, it is clearly understood that neither Purchaser nor
any of its Subsidiaries (including any Acquired Company) shall be liable for
any obligation to pay an Employee any bonus relating to the completion of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (h) Provision of Services. Seller shall provide certain
                      ---------------------
post-Closing services to Purchaser pursuant to a Services Agreement, to be
entered into at or before Closing, on the terms and conditions described in
Schedule 10.1(h).

                                ---------------------
Closing, Purchaser and Seller, or such of their respective Subsidiaries as
appropriate, shall enter into (a) agreements substantially in the form of
Exhibits C, D, E, F, G, H, I and J and (b) an agreement substantially on the
----------  -  -  -  -  -  -     -
terms set forth in the term sheet set forth in Exhibits K, in each case as
                                               ----------
listed on Schedule 10.2 (collectively, the "SEPARATION AGREEMENTS").

                  (a) All warranties contained herein, in any Seller
Document or in any Purchaser Document, and the right to commence any claim
with respect thereto, shall terminate upon the second anniversary of the
Closing Date, except that (i) the warranties contained in Section 4.9
(Taxes) shall survive until 60 calendar days after the end of the period of
the applicable statute of limitations, (ii) the warranties contained in
Sections 4.1 (Organization and Good Standing), 4.2 (Capital Structure of
Purchased Companies), 4.3 (Subsidiaries), 4.4 (Authorization of Agreement),
5.1 (Organization and Good Standing), 5.2 (Authorization of Agreement),
5.7 (Knowledge Regarding Warranties) and 5.8 (No Inducement or Reliance;
Independent Assessment) shall survive without limitation as to time, and
(iii) the warranties contained in Section 4.18 (Environmental Matters) shall
survive until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however,
                                                         --------  -------
that in the event written notice of any claim for indemnification under
Section 11.2(a)(i) or Section 11.2(b)(i) shall have been given in accordance
herewith within the applicable survival period setting forth in reasonable
detail (including a reasonable specification of the legal and factual basis
for such claim), the warranties that are the subject of such indemnification
claim shall survive with respect to such claim until such time as such claim
is fully and finally resolved. The covenants and agreements of the parties
hereto contained herein, in any Seller Document and in any Purchaser
Document, to the extent such covenants and agreements have not been
performed or remain unfulfilled as of the Closing, shall survive the Closing
and continue in effect in accordance with their terms.

                  (b) After the Closing, the indemnification expressly
provided for herein shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for monetary
damages for any breach of warranties, covenants or agreements herein by
either party hereto, and no party shall have any right of rescission (other
than as may be contemplated by Article XIII); provided, however, the
                                              --------  -------
foregoing shall not limit the right of either party hereto to seek specific
enforcement or injunctive or similar relief for a breach of such covenants
or agreements. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall take
all reasonable endeavors to mitigate Losses for which it seeks
indemnification hereunder. No Person shall be entitled to indemnification
hereunder if, on the Closing Date, such Person had knowledge of the actual
breach of any warranty with respect to which such Person is seeking
indemnification hereunder.

                  (c) In calculating any amount of Losses recoverable
pursuant to Section 11.2 or 11.3, the amount of such Losses shall be reduced
by (i) any insurance proceeds actually received from any unaffiliated
insurance carrier offsetting the amount of such Loss, net of any expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such insurance proceeds
(provided, that the Indemnified Party shall be obligated to reasonably seek
 --------
any such proceeds to which it may be entitled), and (ii) any recoveries from
third parties pursuant to indemnification (or otherwise) with respect
thereto, net of any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining
such third party payment.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
party shall be liable to any Indemnified Party for special, incidental,
indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary Losses.

         the Closing Date, without giving effect to the qualification set
         forth in Section 8.1) of warranty on the part of Seller herein
         (other than any warranty contained in Section 4.18 (Environmental
         Matters), indemnification with respect to which is set forth in

         and conditions contained therein;

any assets of such Acquired Companies by them or their predecessors at any
time prior to the Closing Date or (B) the operations of Seller or its
Subsidiaries or their predecessors or the use of the Purchased Assets at the
Suzano, Brazil facility at any time prior to the Closing Date and (ii) such
Environmental Costs exceed the aggregate amount of reserves set forth on
(A) if the Closing Date occurs on or prior to January 31, 2003, the Interim
Balance Sheet, or (B) if the Closing Date occurs after January 31, 2003, the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, in each case, with respect to such Environmental
Claim (or any series of related Environmental Claims), Seller hereby agrees,
except as otherwise provided in the next sentence and subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 11.3(e), to reimburse Purchaser for a
portion of its aggregate Environmental Costs in excess of such aggregate
amount of reserves with respect to such Environmental Claim (or series of
related Environmental Claims) on a sliding scale basis with Seller paying
(1) 70% of the first U.S.$5 million of such excess, (2) 80% of the next
U.S.$5 million of such excess, (3) 90% of the next U.S.$10 million of such
excess and (4) 95% of any additional excess. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this cost sharing arrangement shall not apply, and Seller shall have no
obligation to reimburse any Environmental Costs: (x) incurred at

                                     45

any site arising out of Purchaser's, any member of the Purchaser Indemnified
Group's or any of them or their successors' decision to terminate the
operations conducted at such site; or (y) with respect to any Environmental
Claim based upon any Environmental Law or amendment thereof that was not in
force and effect as of the Closing Date. If Purchaser incurs Environmental
Costs as a result of the presence of Hazardous Materials, which presence
results from the operations of the Acquired Companies or their predecessors
or successors or the use of any assets of such Acquired Companies by them or
their predecessors or successors both prior to and after the Closing Date:
(i) if the relative amounts of Hazardous Materials attributable to
pre-Closing Date and post-Closing Date operations or use of assets may be
clearly established, the relative obligations of the parties shall be
determined proportionally based upon the relative amounts of Hazardous
Materials, and the cost sharing arrangement contained in the first sentence
of this Section 11.3(b) shall apply only to Environmental Costs for
pre-Closing Date operations or use of assets; (ii) if the relative amounts
of Hazardous Materials attributable to pre-Closing Date and post-Closing
Date operations or use of assets cannot be clearly established, pre-Closing
Date and post-Closing Date responsibility will be proportionally allocated
based upon the pounds of products related to such Hazardous Materials
produced by the Acquired Companies or their predecessors in the period prior
to the Closing Date that is equivalent to the period between the Closing
Date and the commencement of the Environmental Claim to which such
Environmental Costs relate, and the pounds of products related to such
Hazardous Materials produced by the Acquired Companies or their successors
or assigns in the period from the Closing Date to the commencement of the
Environmental Claim to which such Environmental Costs relate, and the cost
sharing arrangement contained in the first sentence of this Section 11.3(b)
shall apply only to the pre-Closing Date allocation; provided, however, that
                                                     --------  -------
nothing in this Section 11.3 shall require Seller to contribute to any
Environmental Costs or indemnify any member of the Purchaser Indemnified
Group with respect to any Environmental Costs incurred with respect to the
generation of Hazardous Materials as a result of the operations by any
member of the Purchaser Indemnified Group after the Closing Date. If
Environmental Costs are incurred as a result of the presence of a
combination of Hazardous Materials on and after the Closing Date, then such
Environmental Costs applicable to pre-Closing Date and post-Closing Date
operations or use of assets shall be equitably allocated, generally in
accordance with the principles set forth in the preceding sentence, between
Seller and Purchaser based upon the nature and amount of Hazardous Materials
resulting from pre-Closing Date and post-Closing Date operations or use of
assets.

                  (c) Seller's obligations under Section 11.3(b) are
expressly conditioned upon: (i) Seller being kept fully informed, on a
timely basis, of all substantive contacts between any Governmental Body or
other Person and any of the Purchaser Indemnified Group with respect to each
matter with respect to which indemnification or cost-sharing may be sought
under this Section 11.3 (each, a "COVERED ENVIRONMENTAL MATTER");
(ii) Seller being given by the Purchaser Indemnified Group the option to
participate in and/or manage, in due consultation with Purchaser, all
discussions and proceedings concerning the timing, method, extent and cost
of each Covered Environmental Matter; provided, that if Seller assumes
                                      --------
management of any Covered Environmental Matter, it shall keep Purchaser
fully informed on a timely basis of all substantive contacts relating to
such Covered Environmental Matter with any Governmental Body or other
Person; (iii) Seller being given by the Purchaser Indemnified Group the
authority to determine the method of complying with each Covered
Environmental Matter; provided, Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser to
                      --------
minimize any nuisance or hindrance caused to

                                     46

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Purchaser's operations by any Environmental Remedial Action in connection
with such Covered Environmental Matter and shall submit the project, budget
and any related documents of such Environmental Remedial Action to Purchaser
for comment prior to any submission to the relevant Governmental Body, and,
if Purchaser proposes an alternative method that is acceptable to the
relevant Governmental Body and that would cause less nuisance and/or
hindrance to Purchaser's operations without significantly increasing the
cost, Seller shall either apply the alternative method thus proposed or
compensate Purchaser for any Loss caused by the nuisance and/or hindrance
to Purchaser's operations caused by the Environmental Remedial Action;
(iv) Seller being given the option to challenge in any manner at its sole
expense, including, without limitation, initiating legal proceedings
regarding each Covered Environmental Matter, that Seller considers to be
unlawful; (v) the taking of all reasonable endeavors by the Purchaser
Indemnified Group during discussions, proceedings and other activities
regarding each Covered Environmental Matter, to keep the number and costs of
each such Covered Environmental Matter as low as reasonably possible,
including, but not limited to agreeing to allow the imposition of
institutional controls and/or restrictions in a deed to restrict future
use of the real estate to industrial and commercial purposes only; and
(vi) Seller's obligations under Sections 11.3(b) being limited to Hazardous
Materials as the same were defined in Environmental Laws in force and effect
on the Closing Date and not as the term Hazardous Materials may be defined
thereafter.

                  (d) Seller and Purchaser and their respective Affiliates
shall cooperate and consult with each other in the performance of their
respective obligations hereunder (including with respect to any actions
taken by Seller under Section 11.3(c)), and in taking actions reasonably
necessary to limit the duration, expense and scope of any Environmental Cost
and Environmental Claim. In furtherance of and without limiting the
foregoing, Purchaser shall operate and manage any site with respect to which
it or any other member of the Purchaser Indemnified Group may seek
indemnification or reimbursement of Environmental Costs under this Section
11.3 in a manner consistent with the way in which it operates and manages
its chemical sites with respect to which Purchaser is not entitled to any
reimbursement of Environmental Costs. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
cooperate with Seller as may be reasonably requested by Seller so as to
allow Seller and its Affiliates to receive the benefit of any
indemnification to which Seller or any of its Affiliates may be entitled
under the Hoechst Agreement.

                  (e) Seller shall not be liable for (i) Losses with respect
to the matters set forth in Section 11.3(a)(ii), or (ii) reimbursement of
Environmental Costs under Section 11.3(b), unless: (A) a claim is timely
asserted prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, (B)(1) with
respect to Losses with respect to the matters set forth in Section
11.3(a)(ii); the Loss with respect to the particular act, circumstance,
development, event, fact, occurrence or omission exceeds U.S.$100,000
(aggregating all Losses arising from substantially identical facts), or (2)
with respect to reimbursement of Environmental Costs under Section 11.3(b),
the Environmental Costs arising or resulting from a particular Environmental
Clam (aggregating all Environmental Claims arising from substantially
identical facts) exceed U.S.$100,000; and (C) the aggregate of such Losses
and Environmental Costs exceed, on a cumulative basis, U.S.$5 million (and
then only to the extent of such excess); provided, however, that
                                         --------  -------
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall not be
required to pay an aggregate amount in excess of U.S.$75 million in respect
of Losses with respect to the matters set forth in


                                     47

<PAGE>

Section 11.3(a)(ii) or reimbursement of Environmental Costs under Section
11.3(b). For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations in this Section 11.3(e)
do not apply to Section 11.3(a)(i) (relating to Retained Environmental
Liabilities).

                  (f) Except as provided in any applicable Separation
Agreement, the indemnification and remedies provisions provided for in this
Section 11.3 shall be the exclusive remedy for the matters addressed in
Section 11.3 (irrespective of whether such matters may also constitute a
breach of any of Seller's warranties hereunder), including but not limited
to any private right of action that either party might have under any
Environmental Law. It is expressly understood and agreed that no member of
the Purchaser Indemnified Group shall be allowed to assert any claim under
Section 11.2 with respect to any Environmental Claim or any Environmental
Costs.

                  Section 11.4. Procedures for Indemnification.
                                ------------------------------

                  (a) Whenever a claim shall arise for indemnification under
Section 11.2, 11.3 or 14.1, with the exception of claims for litigation
expenses in respect of litigation as to which a notice of claim, as provided
in this Section 11.4, has previously been given, which expenses shall be
funded on an ongoing basis, and, except as otherwise provided in Section
14.4, the party entitled to indemnification (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall
promptly notify the party from which indemnification is sought (the
"INDEMNIFYING PARTY") of such claim and, when known, the facts constituting
the basis for such claim; provided, however, that in the event of any claim
                          --------  -------
for indemnification hereunder resulting from or in connection with any claim
or Legal Proceeding by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall give such
notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party not later than ten Business Days
prior to the time any response to the asserted claim is required, if
possible, and in any event within fifteen Business Days following receipt of
notice thereof (provided that failure to notify the Indemnifying Party shall
                --------
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have to the
Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
demonstrates that it has been actually prejudiced by such failure). In the
event of any such claim for indemnification resulting from or in connection
with a claim or Legal Proceeding by a third party, the Indemnifying Party
may, at its sole cost and expense, assume the defense thereof by written
notice within 30 calendar days, using counsel that is reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If an Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled to take all steps necessary in the defense thereof including the
settlement of any case that involves solely monetary damages without the
consent of the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the Indemnified
                                  --------  -------
Party may, at its own expense, participate in any such proceeding with the
counsel of its choice without any right of control thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of any claim or Legal Proceeding
by a third party as provided herein, (A) it shall be conclusively
established for the purposes hereof that the claims made in that Legal
Proceeding are within the scope of and subject to indemnification hereunder,
and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly indemnify the Indemnified Party in
accordance with the terms of this Article XI, and (B) the Indemnifying Party
shall not consent to, or enter into, any compromise or settlement of (which
settlement (i) commits the Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to take,
any action or (ii) does not provide for a full and complete written release
by such third party of the Indemnified Party), or consent to the entry of
any judgment that does not relate solely to monetary damages arising from,
any such claim or Legal Proceeding by a third party without the Indemnified
Party's prior written

                                     48

consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully in
all aspects of any investigation, defense, pre-trial activities, trial,
compromise, settlement or discharge of any claim in respect of which
indemnity is sought pursuant to this Article XI, including, but not limited
to, by providing the other party with reasonable access to employees and
officers (including as witnesses) and other information. So long as the
Indemnifying Party is in good faith defending such claim or proceeding, the
Indemnified Party shall not compromise or settle such claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party
does not assume the defense of any such claim or litigation in accordance
with the terms hereof, the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim
or litigation in such manner as it may deem appropriate, including settling
such claim or litigation (after giving prior written notice of the same to
the Indemnifying Party and obtaining the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) on such terms as the Indemnified Party may
reasonably deem appropriate, and the Indemnifying Party will promptly
indemnify the Indemnified Party in accordance with the provisions of this
Article XI.

                  (b) If Seller, as the Indemnifying Party, assumes defense
of a claim or Legal Proceeding under and subject to Section 11.4(a) and such
claim or Legal Proceeding has been brought by a customer or supplier of the
Business of any Acquired Company, subject to any limitation under applicable
Law and in addition to those rights afforded Purchaser as Indemnified Party
under Section 11.4(a), (i) Seller shall provide Purchaser with a timely and
reasonably detailed account of such claim or Legal Proceeding and copies
of all written materials relating to such claim or Legal Proceeding,
(ii) Seller shall consult with Purchaser before taking any significant action
in connection with such claim or Legal Proceeding, (iii) Seller shall consult
with Purchaser and offer Purchaser an opportunity to comment before
submitting any written materials to any Governmental Body prepared or
furnished in connection with such claim or Legal Proceeding, and (iv) Seller
shall defend such claim or Legal Proceeding diligently and in good faith.

                  Section 11.5. Special Indemnification.
                                -----------------------

                  (a) Seller hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Purchaser,
its Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees and agents thereof,
harmless from and against any and all Taxes arising out of or resulting from
the transfer by Seller or its Subsidiaries of the shares of Erste Viking
Resins Germany 1 GmbH or any Liquidating Company pursuant to Section 6.2(e).

                  (b) Whenever a claim shall be made for indemnification
pursuant to Section 11.5(a), Purchaser shall notify Seller of the amount of
such claim and Seller shall, within ten Business Days of such notification,
indemnify Purchaser (or any other Person designated by the Purchaser) in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.5; provided, that, if the
                                                     --------
indemnified party is required to make a payment to a taxing authority,
Seller shall not be required to make any payment earlier than three days
before such payment is due. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the other
provisions of this Article XI shall apply to this Section 11.5. Purchaser
shall render to Seller such assistance as Seller may reasonably request in
defending any Tax Claim giving rise to a claim for indemnification pursuant
to this Section 11.5; provided, that Purchaser shall be under no obligation
                      --------
to render any such assistance if (i) Seller

                                     49

fails to indemnify Purchaser within the time periods contemplated by the
first sentence hereof or (ii) Seller takes any action that would cause
significant harm to Purchaser's reputation with the relevant taxing
authority.

                  Section 12.1. Noncompetition.
                                --------------

                  (a) Subject to Section 12.1(b), Seller covenants and
agrees that for a period of three years following the Closing Date (the
"COVENANT TERM") it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to:

                      (i) engage in the manufacture or sale of products that
         are within the scope of the Business as defined in Exhibit A
                                                            ---------
         (a "COMPETITIVE BUSINESS") in direct competition with Purchaser,
         whether as employer, proprietor, partner, stockholder, consultant,
         agent, lender or guarantor or otherwise; or

                      (ii) make use of, in connection with any Competitive
         Business, any mailing lists, customer lists, subscription lists,
         processes, trade secrets, software, research, techniques, designs
         or other technical data, know-how or other proprietary or
         confidential information used by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
         as of the Closing or within one year prior to the Closing Date in
         connection with the Business or that constitutes a Purchased Asset,
         except to the extent Purchaser may so authorize in writing.

                  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 12.1(a):

                      (i) in the event that during the Covenant Term Seller
         completes a business combination transaction with a Person that is
         engaged in any Competitive Business, which transaction results in
         the holders of the voting securities of Seller outstanding
         immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction owning
         less than 50% of the voting power of the voting securities of
         Seller or the surviving entity in the transaction or any parent
         thereof (any such entity, an "ACQUIROR") outstanding immediately
         after the consummation of such transaction, such Acquiror or any of
         its Subsidiaries or Affiliates may engage in any activity
         prohibited or restricted by Section 12.1(a);

                      (ii) Seller may directly or indirectly hold interests
         in or securities of any Person to the extent that such investment

                      (iii) Seller may maintain and continue the operations
         of Seller and its Subsidiaries that are not being transferred to
         Purchaser hereunder in accordance with current and past practices;

                      (iv) Seller may acquire interests in or securities of
         any Person as an investment by Seller's pension funds or funds of

                      (v) Seller may acquire interests in or securities of

         its most recent fiscal year from activities that constitute
         Competitive Businesses;

                      (vi) Seller may acquire more than 50% of the
         outstanding capital stock or other equity interests in any Person
         (or any lesser percentage if, pursuant to contractual or other
         arrangements, Seller has the right to cause such Person to take the
         actions specified in the following proviso) that derived in excess
         of 15% but not more than 50% of its total annual revenues in its
         most recent fiscal year from activities that constitute Competitive
         Businesses; provided, however, that Seller shall use commercially

                      (vii) Seller may acquire or use any product for
         internal uses or to conduct Seller's or its Subsidiaries' other
         businesses that consume, use, contain, depend upon or otherwise
         incorporate any such product; and

                      (viii) Seller may perform any act or conduct any
         business contemplated hereby or the Separation Agreements.

                  (c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing
herein shall be deemed to require Seller to give notice to or obtain the
consent of Purchaser in order to engage in any transaction of the types
described in Section 12.1(b) or otherwise.

                  Section 12.2. Nonsolicitation of Employees. Seller
                                ----------------------------

acknowledge that the time, scope and other provisions of this Article XII
have been specifically negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties and
specifically hereby agree that such time, scope and other provisions are
reasonable under the circumstances. It is further agreed that other remedies
cannot fully compensate Purchaser for a violation by Seller of the terms of
this Article XII and that Purchaser shall be entitled to injunctive relief
to prevent any such violation or continuing violation by Seller. It is the
intent and understanding of each party hereto that if, in any Legal
Proceeding, any term, restriction, covenant or promise herein is found to be
unreasonable and for that reason unenforceable, then such term, restriction,
covenant or promise shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make
it enforceable.

within fifteen calendar days of the due date for making payment of such
additional Tax. For purposes of determining the amount and timing of any Tax
Benefit, the recipient of the Tax Benefit (a) shall be deemed to pay Tax at

to realize or utilize any Tax Benefit in the first taxable year that such
Tax Benefit may be realized or utilized under applicable Law; provided,

that, if it cannot be determined whether a Tax Benefit is attributable to a
Tax Item resulting from an audit adjustment (or adjustment in any other Tax
Proceeding) described in the first sentence of this Section 14.6 or is
attributable to another Tax Item of the recipient of the Tax Benefit, the
amount of the Tax Benefit deemed realized or utilized pursuant to clause (b)
of the preceding sentence shall be calculated assuming that such Tax Items
are utilized on a pro rata basis.

provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Law), Seller, Purchaser, the Acquired
Companies and their respective Affiliates shall treat any and all payments
under this Article XIV or under Article XI as an adjustment to the purchase
price for all Tax purposes. Any such payments under this Article XIV or
Article XI shall be increased by an amount required to fully indemnify the
recipient for any liabilities for Taxes resulting from the receipt of
payment of such indemnity obligations (other than Taxes resulting from a
reduction in Tax basis), and reduced by any Tax Benefit actually realized by
the recipient as a result of the payment or incurrence of the Losses giving
rise to such indemnity obligations.

calendar year during which the Closing occurs, Purchaser shall not, and

any action described on Schedule 14.8(b) with respect to any of the Acquired

is conclusive and binding on it and may be enforced against it in the courts
of any other jurisdiction.
