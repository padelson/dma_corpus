AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 5, 2009 (this "Agreement"), among SYKES ENTERPRISES, INCORPORATED, a Florida corporation ("Parent"), SH MERGER SUBSIDIARY I, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), SH MERGER SUBSIDIARY II, LLC, a Florida limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub II" and together with Merger Sub, "Merger Subs"), and ICT GROUP, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company" and collectively with Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub II, the "parties"). 

  

W I T N E S S E T H: 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Parent deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective corporation and stockholders that the Company and Parent engage in a business combination; 

  

 WHEREAS, the combination of the Company and Parent shall be effected by, and subject to, the terms of this Agreement through a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company in the Merger, with the Company surviving, as set forth below, and promptly following the Merger, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub II in the Second Merger; 

  

 WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, the parties intend that the Mergers, taken together in the manner described in Revenue Ruling 2001-46, will qualify as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and 

  

 WHEREAS, this Agreement is intended to constitute a Plan of Merger within the meaning of Section 1922 of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended (the "PBCL"). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER 

   

 SECTION 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the PBCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time (the "Merger"). Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

  

 SECTION 1.2 _Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. Tampa, Florida time on the date that is as soon as practicable (but in any event no later than the second (2nd) Business Day) following the satisfaction or (subject to applicable Law) waiver of the 

   ##### 

  

    

conditions set forth in Article VII (excluding conditions that, by their
nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), unless this Agreement has been
previously terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is
agreed to in writing by the parties (the actual time and date of the Closing
being referred to herein as the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held at
the offices of Shumaker, Loop and Kendrick, LLP, 101 E. Kennedy Blvd., Suite
2800, Tampa, Florida 33602, or at such other place as the parties may
agree. 

  

 SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the Company shall (i) file articles of merger ("Articles of Merger") in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the PBCL and (ii) make all other filings or recordings required under the PBCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on the date the Articles of Merger are duly filed with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or on such other date or time as Parent and the Company shall agree and as shall be specified in the Articles of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time"). The date on which the Effective Time occurs is referred to herein as the "Effective Date". 

  

 SECTION 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger will have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of Section 1929 of the PBCL. 

  

 SECTION 1.5 _Bylaws_. At and after the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and shall read in their entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to Section 6.7). 

  

 SECTION 1.6 _Articles of incorporation_. At and after the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated so as to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto and, as so amended and restated, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by applicable Law (subject to Section 6.7). 

  

 SECTION 1.7 _Officers and Directors_. From and after the Effective Time, until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of Merger Sub shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 SECTION 1.8 _Effect on Capital Stock_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by Parent or held in treasury by the Company, all of which shall be canceled as provided in Section 1.8(e)), shall be converted into the right to receive: 

  

       | (i)  |   | the Per Share Amount divided by two (2) in cash
without interest, and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio divided
by two (2).  
   

 

As used herein, the term "Cash Consideration" means cash into which shares of
Company Common Stock are converted, the term "Stock Consideration" means the
Shares of Parent Common Stock into which shares of Company Common Stock are
converted and the term "Merger Consideration" with respect to a given share
of Company Common Stock shall mean the combination of Cash Consideration and
Stock Consideration into which such share of Company Common Stock is
converted as contemplated hereby. 

   

 (c) As used herein, the term "Exchange Ratio" means the quotient determined by dividing the Per Share Amount by the Parent Share Measurement Value; provided that (i) if the Parent Share Measurement Value is equal to or less than $19.3306 the Exchange Ratio will be 0.7956 for all purposes under this Agreement and (ii) if the Parent Share Measurement Value is equal to or greater than $22.4652 the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.6846 for all purposes under this Agreement. "Parent Share Measurement Value" means the volume weighted average of the per share prices of Parent Common Stock as listed in the Nasdaq transaction reporting system for the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Exchange Ratio shall be calculated to the nearest ten thousandth of a share of Parent Common Stock and the Parent Share Measurement Value shall be calculated to the nearest one hundredth of one cent. 

  

 (d) Except as set forth in Section 1.8(e) and Section 1.9(c), as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of outstanding Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") or book-entry shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Book-Entry Shares") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as provided herein or by Law. 

  

 (e) Each share of Company Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by Parent or held in treasury by the Company at the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 1.9 _Company Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_. 

  

 (a) By virtue of the Merger, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the applicable Company Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested and exercisable (collectively, the "Options" or "Company Stock Options") shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to, and then shall be canceled at, the Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall, subject to Section 1.9(c), be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (1) the Per Share Amount over (2) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Option, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded up to the nearest cent, and (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such fully vested and exercisable Option as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Option Consideration"). The Option Consideration shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) By virtue of the Merger, each restricted stock unit, representing a right to receive one share of Company Common Stock (an "RSU") granted by the Company under any Company Stock Plan, including each "performance share award" denominated in RSUs, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested, and then shall be canceled at the Effective Time, and the holder of such vested RSU shall, subject to Section 1.9(c), be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Amount in respect of each share of Company Common Stock into which the vested portion of the RSU would otherwise be convertible (the "RSU Consideration"), which shall, subject to applicable Law, be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 1.9 shall be reduced by any required withholding of taxes in accordance with Section 2.11 and shall be paid without interest. 

  

 (d) Any such amounts representing Option Consideration or RSU Consideration shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and any such amounts paid by the Surviving Corporation shall be reimbursed promptly by Parent to the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall, and such Board of Directors (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall cause the Company to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably required to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.9. 

  

 SECTION 1.10 _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any similar event shall have occurred, the Merger Consideration shall be 

   ##### 

  

    

appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

  

 SECTION 1.11 _Second Merger._  

  

 (a) Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to merge with and into Merger Sub II (the "Second Merger" and together with the Merger, the "Mergers") and the separate corporate existence of the Surviving Corporation shall thereupon cease and Merger Sub II shall be the surviving entity (the "Surviving Entity") in the Second Merger. 

  

 (b) At the effective time of the Second Merger, the common stock of the Surviving Corporation shall automatically be converted into a membership interest in the Surviving Entity representing 100% of the ownership interests in the Surviving Entity. 

  

 (c) With respect to any time following the Second Merger, references herein to the Surviving Corporation shall refer to the Surviving Entity. 

  

ARTICLE II 
 EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

   

 SECTION 2.1 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company to act as exchange agent hereunder (which entity shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Company Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration (the "Exchange Agent"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, book-entry shares (or certificates if requested) representing the Parent Common Stock issuable, and cash in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the Cash Consideration payable, pursuant to Section 1.8 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Parent agrees to make available directly or indirectly to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor pursuant to Section 2.6 of this Agreement and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4 of this Agreement. Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund." 

  

 SECTION 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_. 

  

 (a) Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (such letter to be reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent 

   ##### 

  

    

Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor pursuant to
Section 2.6 of this Agreement and any dividends or distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4 of this Agreement. Upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor: (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate
is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.8 (after taking
into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and
(B) cash in the amount equal to the Cash Consideration that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.8, plus cash that such holder has
the right to receive in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.6 and dividends and other distributions pursuant to
Section 2.4 (in each case, after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock then held by such holder). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Company Book-Entry Shares
shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (b) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 (a) Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, sets forth a true, complete and correct list of each material "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") (whether or not subject to ERISA), and any other material plan, policy, program practice, agreement, understanding or arrangement (whether written or oral) providing compensation or other benefits to any current or former director, officer, employee or consultant (or to any dependent or beneficiary thereof) of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, which are now maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, or under which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has any material obligation or liability, whether actual or contingent, including all incentive, bonus, deferred compensation, vacation, holiday, cafeteria, medical, disability, stock purchase, stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock, restricted stock, restricted stock unit, stock-based compensation, change-in-control, retention, employment, consulting, personnel or severance policies, programs, practices, Contracts or arrangements (each, a "Company Benefit Plan"), excluding Foreign Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Foreign Benefit Plans" shall mean those Company Benefit Plans maintained, sponsored or contributed to primarily for the benefit of current or former employees of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate who are or were regularly employed outside the United States (but which shall exclude any such Company Benefit Plans to the extent required by applicable foreign law to be so maintained, sponsored or contributed to). Not more than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, the Company shall deliver a true, complete and correct list of each material Foreign Benefit Plan to Parent. For purposes of this Section 3.11, "ERISA Affiliate" shall mean any entity (whether or not incorporated) that, together with any other entity, is considered under common control and treated as one employer under Sections 414(b) or (c) of the Code. Except as otherwise set forth in any Company Benefit Plan, the Company has no express or implied commitment to add, terminate, modify or change any Company Benefit Plan in the United States, other than with respect to a termination, modification or change required by applicable Law or which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan (other than any Foreign Benefit Plan), the Company has made available to Parent (or, with respect to items (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii), will provide to Parent not more than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof) true, complete and correct copies of the following (as applicable): (i) the written document evidencing such Company Benefit Plan or, with respect to any such plan that is not in writing, a written description of the material terms thereof; (ii) the summary plan description; (iii) the most recent annual report, financial statement and/or actuarial report; (iv) the most recent determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"); (v) the most recent Form 5500 required to have been filed with the IRS, including all schedules thereto; (vi) any related trust agreements, insurance contracts or other funding arrangements; (vii) any notices to or from the IRS or any office or representative of the Department of Labor or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") relating to any unresolved compliance issues in respect of any such Company Benefit Plan; and (viii) all material amendments, modifications or supplements to any Company Benefit Plan.

With respect to each of the Company Benefit Plans, no event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be subject to any liability that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under Section 401 of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS to such effect and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no fact, circumstance or event has occurred or exists since the date of such determination letter that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Benefit Plan. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no audits or investigations by any Governmental Entity with respect to, or other actions, claims, suits or other proceedings against or involving any Company Benefit Plan or asserting rights or claims to benefits under any Company Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits payable in the normal course).

 (f) Except as set forth on Section 3.11(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter, or as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers will not constitute an event that, either alone or in conjunction with any other event, will or may result in any payment, acceleration, termination, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in compensation or benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any current or former employee or other personnel of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers will not constitute an event that, either alone or in conjunction with any other event, will or may 

   ##### 

  

    

result in (i) any material amount failing to be deductible by reason of
Section 280G of the Code or (ii) the provision of any material reimbursement
of excise Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code or any income Taxes under the

Except as specifically identified on Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any labor or collective bargaining agreement (other than any industry-wide or statutorily mandated agreement or non-material agreement in a non-U.S. jurisdiction). There is no unfair labor practice charge pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened which if determined adversely to the Company or its Subsidiaries would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 Except (i) as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed since January 1, 2009 but prior to the date hereof (but excluding any risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," any disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or predictive or forward-looking in nature, in each case, other than any specific factual information contained therein) or (ii) as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Letter delivered by Parent to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Letter"), which identifies items of disclosure by reference to a particular section or subsection of this Agreement (provided, however, that any information set forth in one section of such Parent Disclosure Letter also shall be deemed to apply to each other section and subsection of this Agreement to which its relevance is reasonably apparent), each of Parent and Merger Subs hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows: 

  

 SECTION 4.1 _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. 

  

 (a) Each of Parent, Merger Subs and Parents Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted, except with respect to Parents Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing or to have such power or authority when taken together with all other such failures, has not, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and its Significant Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing or to have such power or authority when taken together with all other such failures, has not, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (b) Parent has delivered or made available to the Company a true and complete copy of Parents and each Merger Subs currently effective articles of incorporation and bylaws or any equivalent organizational or governing documents, as amended and restated to the date hereof. Such organizational or governing documents so delivered are in full force and effect and none of Parent or Merger Subs is in violation of such organizational documents. 

  

 SECTION 4.2 _Capital Structure_. 

  

 (a) As of September 29, 2009, the authorized capital stock of Parent consisted of (i) 200,000,000 shares of Parent common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which 41,631,700 shares were outstanding and 328,508 shares were held in the treasury of Parent, and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Parent preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which no shares were outstanding and no shares were held in the treasury of Parent. There are no other classes of 

   ##### 

  

 

capital stock of Parent authorized or outstanding. All issued and outstanding
shares of the capital stock of Parent are, and when shares of Parent Common
Stock are issued in connection with the Merger or pursuant to Section 1.8 and
Section 1.9, such shares will be, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable and free of any preemptive rights. 

   

 (b) Since June 30, 2009 to the date of this Agreement, there have been no issuances of shares of the capital stock or equity securities of Parent or any other securities of Parent other than issuances of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to employee benefit, director or equity compensation plans, programs or arrangements sponsored or maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Parent Benefit Plans"). There were outstanding as of June 30, 2009 no options, warrants, calls, commitments, agreements, arrangements, undertakings or any other rights to acquire capital stock from Parent other than options, restricted stock and other rights to acquire capital stock from Parent under the Parent Benefit Plans. As of September 29, 2009, there were stock options outstanding representing the right to purchase 196,435 shares of Parent Common Stock under the Parent Benefit Plans, and stock-settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights outstanding that would entitle the holders to receive an aggregate of 156,243 shares of Parent Common Stock, based upon the closing price of the Parent Common Stock on that day, and assuming the full vesting of all of such stock-settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights.

ARTICLE VI 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

   

 SECTION 6.1 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting_. 

  

 (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall prepare (with Parents reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC a proxy statement to be sent to the shareholders of the Company in connection with the Company Shareholder Meeting (such proxy statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") and Parent shall prepare (with the Companys reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (such registration statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Form S-4"). The Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable Law. Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party copies of any written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments, with respect to the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement received from the SEC. Parent shall provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Form S-4, and any amendment or supplement thereto, prior to filing such with the SEC, and will promptly provide the Company with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, and any amendment or supplement thereto, prior to filing such with the SEC, and will promptly provide Parent with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the 

   ##### 

  

    

contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference)
to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement shall be made without the approval of
Parent and the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided, that with respect to documents filed by a
party which are incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or Proxy
Statement, this right of approval shall apply only with respect to
information relating to the other party or its business, financial condition
or results of operations; and provided, further, that the Company, in
connection with a Change in the Company Recommendation (as defined in Section
6.1(b)), may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement (including by
incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment to effect such
a Change in the Company Recommendation. The Company will use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
shareholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action (other
than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified or to file a general consent to service of process) required to
be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the
issuance of Parent Common Stock and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Parent will advise
the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension
of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with
the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the
SEC for amendment of the Form S-4, and the Company will advise Parent,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time
any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or
the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of
the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers
such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the
extent required by Law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company. 

  

 (b) The Company shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of shareholders of the Company on a date as soon as reasonably practicable following the effectiveness of the Form S-4 ("Company Shareholder Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Company Requisite Vote; provided, however, that the Company shall be permitted to delay or postpone convening the Company Shareholder Meeting to the extent the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof, after consultation with outside legal counsel, reasonably believes that such delay or postponement is consistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company to the effect as set forth in Section 3.3(b) (the "Company Recommendation"), and shall not (x) withdraw, modify or qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent such recommendation or (y) approve, adopt or recommend any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clauses (x) or (y) being referred to herein as a "Change in the Company Recommendation"); provided the foregoing shall not prohibit accurate disclosure (and such 

   ##### 

  

    

disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Change in the Company Recommendation)
of factual information regarding the business, financial condition or results
of operations of Parent or the Company or the fact that an Acquisition
Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making such proposal or the
material terms of such proposal in the Proxy Statement or otherwise, to
the extent the Company in good faith determines that such information, facts,
identity or terms is required to be disclosed under applicable Law; provided
further, that the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Change in the
Company Recommendation pursuant to Section 6.4(d). 

  

 (c) The Company and Parent shall coordinate and cooperate in connection with (i) the preparation of the Form S-4, the Proxy Statement and any other filings that are required to consummate the Mergers and any related transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required (or any actions are required to be taken under, or consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to, any Company Material Contracts and Company Benefit Plans) in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) using reasonable best efforts to timely take any such actions (including seeking any such consents, approvals or waivers) or making any such filings or furnishing information required in connection therewith or with the Form S-4, the Proxy Statement or any other filings. 

  

 SECTION 6.2 _Access to Information/Employees_. 

  

 (a) Upon reasonable notice, and subject to applicable Law, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors, financing sources and other authorized Representatives of the Parent reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its and its Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts, commitments, records, officers and employees and, during such period as Parent may from time to time reasonably request, and during such period the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all other information concerning it, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective businesses, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request (including consultation with respect to litigation matters); provided, however, that the Company may restrict the foregoing access and the disclosure of information pursuant to Section 6.12 to the extent that (i) in the reasonable judgment of the Company, any Law applicable to the Company requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information, (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the Company, the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a Third Party, (iii) such disclosure would result in disclosure of any trade secrets of Third Parties or (iv) disclosure of any such information or document could result in the loss of attorney-client privilege, work product protections or other applicable privileges (provided that the Company and/or its counsel shall use their reasonable best efforts to enter into such joint defense agreements or other arrangements, as appropriate, so as to allow for such disclosure in a manner that does not result in the loss of such privileges or protections); provided, however, that with respect to clauses (i) through (iv) of this Section 6.2(a), the Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to (A) obtain the required consent of such Third Party to provide such access or disclosure or (B) develop an alternative to 

   ##### 

  

    

providing such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company. 

  

 (b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.12, each of Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause such partys Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, which agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

  

 SECTION 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws and regulations to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing, in consultation with the other party and as promptly as practicable and advisable after the date hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, Tax ruling requests and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, Tax rulings and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Third Party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) taking all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain all such material consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, Tax rulings, orders and approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make or cause to be made, in consultation and cooperation with the other and as promptly as practicable and advisable after the date hereof (and, in any event, within fifteen (15) Business Days following the date hereof), (A) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act, and (B) all other necessary registrations, declarations, notices and filings relating to the Mergers with other Governmental Entities under any other antitrust, competition, trade regulation or other Regulatory Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and to respond to any inquiries received and supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Regulatory Law and to take all other actions reasonably necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other Regulatory Law as soon as practicable and not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law or enter into any agreement with a Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If necessary to obtain any regulatory approval pursuant to any Regulatory Law, or if any administrative or judicial Action, including any Action by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted by a Governmental Entity), challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other to (x) obtain any regulatory approval, (y) contest and resist any such Action, or (z) avoid the entry of or have vacated or terminated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction, or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing or the other transactions contemplated herein. Parent shall be 

   ##### 

  

    

responsible for all filing fees and local counsel fees relating to any filings
contemplated in the foregoing. 

  

 (b) To the extent permissible under applicable Law, each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.3(a) to obtain all requisite approvals, clearances and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") or any other Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) permit the other party, or the other partys legal counsel, to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, (iv) give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences to the extent allowed by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity, (v) in the event one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity from participating in or attending any meetings or conferences, keep the other promptly and reasonably apprised with respect thereto and (vi) cooperate in the filing of any memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence, or other written communications explaining or defending the transactions contemplated hereby, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument, and/or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental Entity. 

  

 (c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Regulatory Law or if any suit or proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, is instituted by any Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) oppose or defend against any action to prevent or enjoin consummation of this Agreement (and the transactions contemplated herein), and/or (ii) take such action as reasonably necessary to overturn any regulatory action by any Government Entity to block consummation of this Agreement (and the transactions contemplated herein), including by defending any suit, action, or other legal proceeding brought by any Governmental Entity in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated, overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary, in order to resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental Entity or private party may have to such transactions under such Regulatory Law so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that Parent and Company shall cooperate with one another in connection with all proceedings related to the foregoing and Parent shall have final decision-making authority on any action or decision required to insure that Parent can meet its obligations in this Section 6.3 and its ability to consummate the transaction. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to Section 6.3(e), Parent shall and, shall cause its Subsidiaries to, propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is 

   ##### 

  

    

accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or effective as of the Effective Time,
the Company or its Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or offer to
commit to take any action (including any action that limits its freedom of
action, ownership or control with respect to, or its ability to retain or
hold, any of the businesses, assets, product lines, properties or services of
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries) which it is lawfully capable of taking and if the offer
is accepted, take or commit to take such action, in each case, as may be
required in order to avoid the commencement of any Action to prohibit the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or if already
commenced, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any Action so
as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any
event, not later than the Termination Date). 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not, without the consent of Parent, publicly or before any Governmental Entity or other third party, offer, suggest, propose or negotiate, and shall not commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, any sale, divestiture, disposition, prohibition or limitation or other action of a type described in Section 6.3(d). 

  

 SECTION 6.4 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

  

 (a) The Company agrees that it shall not and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer from a Third Party relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any substantive discussion or negotiation with respect to, or provide any confidential information or data to any Person relating to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar Contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any Contract or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or breach its obligations hereunder or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including any transaction under, or a Third Party becoming an "interested shareholder" under, the PBCL), or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the Companys articles of incorporation or bylaws, inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal (and, to the extent permitted thereunder, the Company shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore granted, to any Person other than Parent or any of Parents Affiliates, under any such provisions) or (v) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, discussion or negotiation with any Persons conducted prior to the execution of this Agreement by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of the Companys Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall promptly request the return or destruction of all confidential information provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such Person in connection with the consideration of any 

   ##### 

  

    

Acquisition Proposal to the extent that the Company is entitled to have such
documents returned or destroyed. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.4(a), if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the time on which the Company has received the Company Requisite Vote, (i) in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal made or received after the date of this Agreement from a Third Party whom the Companys Board of Directors determines, in good faith, is credible and is reasonably capable of making a Superior Proposal (an "Inquiry"), in each case, under circumstances not involving a breach of Section 6.4(a) in any material respect, the Company may furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry; provided that the Company (A) will not, and will not allow the Companys Subsidiaries and the Companys Representatives to, disclose any information to such Person without first entering into a confidentiality agreement with terms overall no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (B) will, subject to applicable Law, promptly provide to Parent any information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent. 

  

 (c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry (and in no event later than 24 hours following the Companys, any of its Subsidiaries or any Representatives receipt of the Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry), such notice to include the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and a copy of such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry, including draft agreements or term sheets submitted in connection therewith (or, where no such copy is available, a reasonably detailed description of such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry), including any modifications thereto. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of any material developments with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and shall provide Parent with copies of all written inquiries and correspondence with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry no later than 24 hours following the receipt thereof. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Companys Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any Contract, in each case, that prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Companys Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify, or grant permission under, the standstill provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party which prohibits the counterparty from making, effecting, entering into, making or participating in any solicitation of proxies in respect of, seeking, proposing or otherwise acting alone or in concert with others, to influence the management or Board of the Directors of the Company with respect to, or advising, assisting, knowingly encouraging or acting as a financing source for, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the standstill provisions of any such agreement, and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore granted, to any Person other than Parent or any of Parents Affiliates, under any such provisions except, in each case, if the Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the 

   ##### 

  

    

failure to take such action could reasonably be determined to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Companys Board of Directors may at any time prior to the time that the Company receives the Company Requisite Vote (i) effect a Change in the Company Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if the Companys Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action could reasonably be determined to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) effect a Change in the Company Recommendation in response to an Acquisition Proposal if the Companys Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action could reasonably be determined to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and/or (iii) if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Companys Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and the Companys financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (the "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"); provided, however, that (A) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) Business Days in advance of its intention to take any such action referred to in clause (i), (ii) and (iii), (B) the Company has negotiated in good faith with Parent since the delivery of such notice to amend the terms of this Agreement so that the Superior Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, and (C) the Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal. 

  

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit the Companys Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys shareholders if the Board of Directors of the Company determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure could reasonably be determined to be inconsistent with applicable Law; provided, however, that any disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of its recommendation to its shareholders in favor of the Merger shall be deemed to be a Change in the Company Recommendation. 

  

 For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or proposal by any Third Party concerning any (i) merger, consolidation, other business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to which such Person would own 15% or more of the consolidated assets, revenues or net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) sale, lease, license or other disposition directly or indirectly by merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange, joint venture or otherwise, of assets of the Company (including Equity Interests of any of its Subsidiaries) or any Subsidiary of the Company representing 15% or more of the consolidated assets, revenues or net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) issuance or sale or other 

   ##### 

  

    

disposition (including by way of merger, consolidation, business combination,
share exchange, joint venture or similar transaction) of Equity Interests
representing 15% or more of the voting power of the Company, (iv) transaction
or series of transactions in which any Person will acquire beneficial
ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of Equity Interests
representing 15% or more of the voting power of the Company or (v) any
combination of the foregoing. 

  

 For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (except the references therein to "15%" shall be replaced by "50%"), which, in the good faith judgment of the Companys Board of Directors (after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside counsel), taking into account the various legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal, including the financing terms thereof, and the Person making such proposal (i) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, and (ii) if consummated would result in a transaction that is more favorable than the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby to the Companys shareholders, from a financial point of view. 

  

 SECTION 6.5 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne solely and entirely by the party incurring such Expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated; provided, however, that Parent and the Company shall share equally all costs and expenses (other than attorneys and accountants fees and expenses) incurred in relation to printing and filing and, as applicable, mailing the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto and all SEC and other regulatory filing fees incurred in connection with the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement.

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, fulfill and discharge, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, fulfill and discharge, in accordance with its respective terms as in effect as of the date hereof or as may be amended or terminated after the date hereof with the prior written consent of Parent, each of the written employment, change in control, severance and termination agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any director, officer or employee of such company listed on Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "CIC Severance Agreements") and the obligations of Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under each deferred compensation plan or agreement listed on Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

  

 (c) With respect to any Parent Benefit Plans in which Covered Employees first become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (collectively, "New Benefit Plans"), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) waive any pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Covered Employees under any such New Benefit Plans providing medical, dental or vision benefits to the same extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide each Covered Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time during the calendar year in which such Effective Time occurs (or if later, paid in the year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate), to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time, in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any such New Benefit Plan in which the Covered Employee participates during the calendar year in which such Effective Time occurs (or if later, the year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate) and (iii) recognize all service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time to the Company, its Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service to Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) after the Effective Time), for all purposes (including, but not limited to, eligibility to participate, vesting credit, entitlement to benefits and benefit accrual) of any New Benefit Plans (including those providing for vacation and paid time-off) in which any Covered Employee participates after the Effective Time; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service. 

  

 (d) Nothing in this Section 6.6 shall be construed to (i) limit the right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, or (ii) require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to retain the employment of any particular Covered Employee for any fixed period of time following the Closing Date. 

  

 (e) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.5, the provisions of this Section 6.6 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be 

   ##### 

  

    

construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other employee
benefit plan for any purpose. 

  

 SECTION 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, all past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) and all fiduciaries under any Company Benefit Plans (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs, expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of any other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other business or non-profit enterprise (including an employee benefit plan) whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), and provide advancement of expenses to the Indemnified Parties (within ten (10) days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from an Indemnified Party of a request therefor), in all such cases to the same extent that such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Companys articles of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification agreements, if any, or by any one of the Companys Subsidiaries pursuant to such Subsidiarys articles of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification agreements of any Subsidiary of the Company, if any, in existence on the date hereof, (ii) without limitation to clause (i), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving Corporations (or any successors) articles of incorporation and bylaws for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the current provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors, officers and employees of the Company, contained in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and (iii) not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding or threatened Action (and in which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing, and cooperates in the defense of such proceeding or threatened Action. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will use reasonable best efforts to obtain "tail" prepaid insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from Parents or the Companys current insurance carrier, or an insurance carrier with the same or better rating as the lower rated of Parents and the Companys current insurance carrier, with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), for the Indemnified Parties, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the 

   ##### 

  

    

transactions contemplated hereby). If such "tail" prepaid insurance policies
have been obtained, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
after the Effective Time, to maintain such policies in full force and effect,
for its full term, and to continue to honor its respective obligations
thereunder. If Parent for any reason fails to obtain such "tail"
prepaid insurance policies prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
continue to maintain in effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time for
the Indemnified Parties, the DandO Insurance (provided that Parent (or any
successor) may substitute therefor policies of at least the same terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage and amounts which are, in the
aggregate, as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as provided in
the existing policies as of the date of this Agreement) or, if such insurance
is unavailable, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, purchase the best available DandO Insurance for such
six-year period from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to the
Companys existing DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and with
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement with respect to claims,
actions, suits, proceedings or investigations, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to facts or
events that occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including with
respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby). The
foregoing notwithstanding, in no event will Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend annually in excess of 250% of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (and to the extent
the annual premium would exceed 250% of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such coverage, the Surviving Corporation shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause to be maintained the maximum amount of coverage
as is available for such 250% of such annual premium). The obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.7 shall not
be terminated, amended or modified in any manner so as to adversely affect
any Indemnified Party (including their successors, heirs and legal
representatives) to whom this Section 6.7 applies without the consent of such
affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this Section 6.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of
this Section 6.7, and this Section 6.7 shall be enforceable by such
Indemnified Parties and their respective successors, heirs and legal
representatives and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation). 

  

 (b) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7. 

  

 (c) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.7 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 6.8 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company have agreed upon the form and substance of the press release to be issued by Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, announcing the execution of this Agreement and the Merger, which shall be issued promptly following the execution and delivery hereof. Subject to Section 6.1, each of Parent and the Company agrees that no public release, announcement, and/or other public statement with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued prior to consulting with and considering in good faith the views of the other party, and except as such public release, announcement, and/or other public statement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange or regulatory body or Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required to make the public release, announcement, and/or other public statement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such public release, announcement, and/or other public statement in advance of such issuance. 

  

 SECTION 6.9 _Listing of Shares of Parent Common Stock_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and such other shares to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 SECTION 6.10 _Dividends_. Neither Parent nor the Company shall declare, set aside or pay any dividends with respect to their capital stock prior to the Effective Date or the termination of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with the interpretive guidance set forth by the SEC. 

  

 SECTION 6.12 _Company Cooperation on Certain Matters_. After the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall establish a mechanism, subject to applicable Law, reasonably acceptable to both parties by which the parties will confer on a regular and continued basis regarding the general status of the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and integration planning matters and communicate and consult with specific persons to be identified by each party to the other with respect to the foregoing. 

  

 SECTION 6.13 _Treatment of the Mergers as a "Reorganization" for Federal Income Tax Purposes_. Parent, Merger Subs and the Company shall not take, and shall not permit any of the Subsidiaries (including, in the case of Parent and Merger Subs), Affiliates, Representatives or any "related person" (within the meaning of such term as used in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368 1) to take, any action that would prevent the Mergers, taken together in the manner described in Revenue Ruling 2001-46, from qualifying as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code. Merger Sub II will not, in connection with the transactions provided for 

   ##### 

  

    

herein, elect to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, be merged with or into any entity that is treated as other than an
entity whose separate existence from Parent is disregarded for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, transfer any portion of its assets to an entity that is
treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or take any
action that would cause it not to be treated as an entity whose separate
existence from Parent is disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Parent will not, in connection with the transactions provided for herein,
take any action which would cause Merger Sub II not to be treated as an
entity whose separate existence from Parent is disregarded for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. The parties hereto intend that the Mergers, taken
together in the manner described in Revenue Ruling 2001-46, shall qualify as
a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code and shall not take
income tax positions inconsistent with such qualification. For the avoidance
of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge that, in determining whether the
payment of Merger Consideration and other relevant amounts pursuant to this
Agreement satisfy the continuity of interest requirement of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-1(e), the "signing date rule" of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-1T(e)(2) shall be inapplicable to the valuation of Parent Common
Stock. Accordingly, for such continuity of interest testing purposes, Parent
Common Stock shall be valued either (i) as of the Effective Date if the
Effective Time occurs when Nasdaq has opened for trading on the Effective
Date, or (ii) as of the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Date
if the Effective Time occurs when Nasdaq has not yet opened for trading on
the Effective Date.

In the event that McDermott Will and Emery is unwilling to provide such

In rendering such opinion, such counsel shall be entitled to receive and rely upon representations, warranties and

opinion shall acknowledge that, in determining whether the payment of the
Merger Consideration and other relevant amounts pursuant to this Agreement
satisfy the continuity of interest requirement of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-1(e), the "signing date rule" of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1T(e)(2) shall be inapplicable to the valuation of Parent Common Stock.
Accordingly, for such continuity of interest testing purposes, the opinion
shall provide that Parent Common Stock shall be valued either (i) as of the

on the Effective Date, or (ii) as of the Business Day immediately preceding
the Effective Date if the Effective Time occurs when Nasdaq has not yet
opened for trading on the Effective Date. Furthermore, for the purpose of
determining whether the payment of the Merger Consideration and other
relevant amounts pursuant to this Agreement satisfy the continuity of interest
requirement of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e), the opinion shall
assume that at least forty percent (40%) of such amounts must be payable in
Parent Common Stock (as compared to cash or other consideration) in order for
the Mergers to be treated as an integrated "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code. In the event that Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP
is unwilling to provide such opinion, the Company shall accept such opinion
from McDermott Will and Emery, if such firm will provide the same to the
Company.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent Parent is entitled to receive a Termination Fee and reimbursement of its Expenses in connection with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of this Section 8.2, Parents receipt thereof shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Subs and their Affiliates against the Company and any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, shareholders, assignees, representatives or Affiliates for any loss or damage suffered in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

   ##### 

  

    

following such termination, in the case of termination pursuant to Section
8.1(f), and (z) prior to or concurrently with such termination, in the case
of termination pursuant to Section 8.1(h). In addition, the Company shall
reimburse Parents Expenses actually incurred by Parent on or prior to the
termination of this Agreement under the circumstances described in clauses

Company be required to reimburse Parents Expenses in excess of
$4,500,000.00. Such reimbursement shall be paid promptly (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) following the Companys receipt of an
invoice therefor, provided that such invoice may not be rendered prior to the
date that the applicable Termination Fee would be payable. 

  

 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g), then the Company shall reimburse Parents Expenses actually incurred by Parent on or prior to the termination of this Agreement; provided however, that in no event shall the Company be required to reimburse Parents Expenses in excess of $4,500,000.00. Such reimbursement shall be paid promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) following the Companys receipt of an invoice therefor. 

  

 (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g) and (i) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the taking of the vote to adopt this Agreement at the Company Shareholder Meeting an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or publicly made known to the shareholders of the Company and shall not have been withdrawn prior to the taking of the vote to adopt this Agreement at the Company Shareholder Meeting and (ii) within twelve (12) months of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with any Third Party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company is consummated, then the Company shall pay to Parent, not later than two (2) Business Days after the earlier of the date any such agreement is entered into or any such Acquisition Proposal is consummated, an amount equal to the Termination Fee; provided, however, that for purposes of the definition of Acquisition Proposal in this Section 8.2(d), references to "15%" shall be replaced by "50%." 

  

 (e) All payments under this Section 8.2 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee or reimburse Parents Expenses on more than one occasion. 

  

 (f) If the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee or reimburse Parents Expenses, the Company shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by Parent (including reasonable Expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 8.2 from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal. 

  

 SECTION 8.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of the Company, but, after any such approval by the shareholders of the Company, no amendment shall be made which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further 

   ##### 

  

    

approval by such shareholders without obtaining such further approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties. 

  

 SECTION 8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (ii) waive any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance by the other of any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. In addition and notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Closing cannot occur as scheduled pursuant to Article I due to an act of God, war, terrorism, flood, banking moratorium or suspension of payments in respect of federal or state banks in the United States (whether or not mandatory), the Closing will automatically be postponed until the earliest date that is reasonably practicable following the conclusion of such event and if such date is after the Termination Date, then the Termination Date shall automatically be extended to such date, and in such case, all references to the term "Termination Date" in this Agreement shall mean such extended date. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.
