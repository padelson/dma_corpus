 **ARTICLE IV**

  

 **Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
 Exchange of Certificates**

  

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:

  

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the common stock, without par
value, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (each, an " _Excluded Share_
" and collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be converted into the
right to receive $44.00 per Share in cash, less any required withholding
Taxes as described in _Section 4.2(f) _and without interest (the " _Per
Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares
shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest.

  

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share referred to in
_Section 4.1(a) _shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled
without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

  

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock,
without par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, without
par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares,
a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent
to make payments under _Section 4.1(a) _(such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall
invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable under _Section 4.1(a) _shall be promptly returned to the
Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are losses with respect to
any such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below
the level required to make prompt cash payment under _Section 4.1(a)_, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments under
_Section 4.1(a)_.

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within five business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders
of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(e)_) to the
Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(e)_) in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
4.2(e)_) to the

        

Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
4.2(f)_) equal to (A) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
4.2(e)_) multiplied by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged
upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if
the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.

  

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _ARTICLE IV_.

  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the shareholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE IV_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per
Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(f)_) upon due surrender of its
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
4.2(e)_), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit),
general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity
of any kind or nature.

  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(f)_) equal to the number of Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the
Per Share Merger Consideration.

  

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the
applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, Surviving
Corporation, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be.

        

4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

  

(a) _Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase
Shares under the Stock Plans, vested or unvested (a " _Company Option_ "),
shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no
later than three business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to the Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration _over_ the exercise
price per Share under such Company Option, less applicable Taxes required to
be withheld with respect to such payment.

  

(b) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
the board of directors of the Company and the compensation and stock option
committee of the board of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall
adopt resolutions to implement the provisions of _Section 4.3(a)_, it being
understood that the intention of the parties is that following the Effective
Time no holder of any Company Option or any participant in any Stock Plan or
other employee benefit arrangement of the Company shall have any
right thereunder to acquire any capital stock (including any phantom stock or
stock appreciation right) of the Company, any Subsidiary or the Surviving
Corporation. The Company shall deliver to the holders of the Company Options
appropriate notices, at a time and in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent,
setting forth such holders rights pursuant to this Agreement.

  

4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time
as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

  

 **ARTICLE V**

  

 **Representations and Warranties**

  

5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth
(i) in (A) the Company Reports filed with the SEC from and after May 31, 2006
through and including the date hereof or (B) the Form 8-K previously
disclosed to Parent and to be filed in connection with the announcement of
this Agreement (but, in any case, only to the extent (x) such disclosure does
not constitute a "risk factor" or a "forward-looking statement" under the
heading "Forward-Looking Statements" in any of such Company Reports and (y)
the applicability of such disclosure to a section or subsection of these
representations and warranties is reasonably apparent) or (ii) in the
corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered
to Parent by the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item
in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent) the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

  

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction
of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation or similar entity in each jurisdiction
where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or
authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, the term (i) "
_Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person of which
at least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having by their
terms ordinary voting

        

power to elect a majority of the board of directors or other persons
performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by
such Person and/or by one or more of its Subsidiaries, (ii) "
_Significant Subsidiary_ " is as defined in Rule 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X
promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
" _Exchange Act_ ") and (iii) " _Company Material  Adverse Effect_" means an
event, change, effect, development, condition or occurrence (each a "
_Change_ ") that is or reasonably would be expected to be, individually or in
the aggregate, materially adverse to (x) the ability of the Company to timely
perform its obligations under and consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (y) the condition (financial or otherwise), business,
assets, liabilities or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole; _provided_ that no Change to the
extent resulting from the following shall constitute or be taken into account
in determining whether there has been or reasonably would be expected to be
a Company Material Adverse Effect under clause (x) or (y):

  

(A) changes in the economy or financial markets generally in the United
States or other countries in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
conduct operations or that are the result of acts of war or terrorism;

  

(B) general changes or developments in any industry in which the Company and
its Subsidiaries operate;

  

(C) any loss or threatened loss of, or adverse change or threatened adverse
change in, the relationship of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
its customers, partners, employees, financing sources or suppliers, or any
change in the Companys credit ratings, caused by the pendency or the
announcement of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

(D) (1) any restatement of the Companys financial statements or any delay in
filing periodic reports at the time required by the Exchange Act solely to
the extent resulting from the failure to (x) properly document the
measurement date for any stock option grant, (y) record stock option expense
(or other items relating thereto) in accordance with GAAP or (z) issue stock
options in accordance with the terms of any applicable Stock Plan (the
failures described in clauses (x), (y) and (z) being " _Option Accounting
Issues_ ") or (2) any civil investigation or civil litigation to the extent
arising out of or relating to any Options Accounting Issues or applicable
Laws relating thereto (including the IBCL and the Exchange Act) or (3) any of
the "Potential Consequences" set forth in _Section 5.1(e) _of the Company
Disclosure Letter solely to the extent resulting from Option Accounting
Issues;

  

(E) the failure by the Company to take any action prohibited by this
Agreement;

  

(F) changes in any Law or GAAP or interpretation thereof after the date
hereof;

  

(G) any failure by the Company to meet any estimates of revenues or earnings
for any period ending on or after the date of this Agreement in and of
itself; _provided_ that the exception in this clause (G) shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any Change underlying or contributing
to such failure has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material
Adverse Effect; and

  

(H) a decline in the price or trading volume of the Company common stock on
the NASDAQ Global Select Market (the " _NASDAQ_ ") in and of itself;
_provided_ that the exception in this clause (H) shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any Change underlying or contributing
to such decline has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material
Adverse Effect;

        

unless, in the case of the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (F), such changes
have a disproportionate effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, when compared to other companies operating in the same industries in
which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate.

  

(b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 500,000,000 Shares, of which 245,210,886 Shares were outstanding
as of the close of business on November 30, 2006, and 5,250 shares of
preferred stock, none of which were outstanding as of the date hereof. Since
such date, the Company has not issued any Shares other than the issuance of
Shares upon the exercise of Company Options outstanding on such date
and since December 8, 2006, the Company has not issued any Company
Options other than ordinary course "anniversary grants" of Company Options
that are not, in the aggregate, material. All of the outstanding Shares have
been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As
of the date of this Agreement, other than Shares reserved for issuance under
the Biomet, Inc. 1998 Qualified and Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan and the
2006 Equity Incentive Plan **** (collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ "), the
Company has no Shares reserved for issuance. _Section 5.1(b) _of the Company
Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list as of December 8, 2006
of options, restricted stock, performance stock units, restricted stock units
and any other equity or equity-based awards (including cash-settled awards),
if any, outstanding under the Stock Plans, including the holder, date of
grant, term, number of Shares and, where applicable, exercise price. Each of
the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity securities of each of
the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge,
security interest, claim or other encumbrance (each, a " _Lien_ ").
Except as set forth above, there are no preemptive or other outstanding
rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights,
redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls,
commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any
securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any equity
securities of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, or
contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any
payments directly or indirectly based (in whole or in part) on the price or
value of the Shares or preferred shares, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon any
issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such
Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and free and clear of any Liens. The Company does not have outstanding any
bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations for borrowed money the holders
of which have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders of the Company or
any of its Significant Subsidiaries on any matter. For purposes of this
Agreement, a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall include
any Subsidiary of the Company of which all of the shares of capital stock of
such Subsidiary other than director qualifying shares are owned by the
Company (or a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company).

  

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

  

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute and deliver this Agreement
and to perform its obligations under this Agreement subject only, in the case
of the consummation of the Merger, to approval of the "plan of merger" (as
such term is used in Section 23-1-40 of the IBCL) contained in this Agreement
by the holders of seventy five percent (75%) of the outstanding Shares
entitled to vote on such matter at a shareholders meeting duly called and
held for such purpose (the " _Requisite Company Vote_ "). This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization,

        

moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception_ ").

  

(ii) The board of directors of the Company has (A) unanimously determined
that the Merger is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders,
unanimously adopted and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and unanimously resolved to
recommend approval of the "plan of merger" (as such term is used in Section
23-1-40 of the IBCL) contained in this Agreement to the holders of Shares
(the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "), (B) directed that this Agreement be
submitted to the holders of Shares for their approval of the "plan of merger"
contained in this Agreement at a shareholders meeting duly called and held
for such purpose, (C) received the opinion of its financial advisor, Morgan
Stanley and Co. Incorporated, to the effect that the consideration to be
received by the holders of the Shares in the Merger is fair from a financial
point of view, as of the date of such opinion, to such holders (the "
_Opinion_ "), (D) assuming that Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
affiliates collectively beneficially own less than 10% of the outstanding
Shares, taken all necessary steps to render Section 23-1-43 of the IBCL
inapplicable to Parent and Merger Sub and to the Merger, and (E) resolved to
elect, to the extent permitted by Law, for the Company not to be subject to
any Takeover Statute. It is agreed and understood that the Opinion is for the
benefit of the Companys board of directors and may not be relied on by
Parent or Merger Sub.

  

(d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts_.

  

(i) Other than the filings and/or notices (A) pursuant to _Section 1.3_, (B)
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended
(the " _HSR Act_ "), (C) under Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (the "
_ECMR_ "), and any other applicable foreign merger control laws, (D) under
the Exchange Act, (E) under the rules of the NASDAQ and (F) required to be or
customarily filed pursuant to any state environmental transfer statutes (the
" _Company Approvals_ "), no notices, reports or other filings are required
to be made by the Company with, nor are any consents, registrations,
approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained by the Company
from, any domestic or foreign governmental or regulatory authority, agency,
commission, body, court or other legislative, executive or judicial
governmental entity (each a " _Governmental Entity_ "), in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, except those that the failure to make or obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the articles of incorporation or bylaws of
the Company or the comparable governing instruments of any of its Significant
Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the
creation or acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a Lien on any
of the assets of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries pursuant
to any material agreement, lease, license, contract, note, mortgage,
indenture, arrangement or other obligation (each, a " _Contract_ ") binding
upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, (C) assuming compliance with
the matters referred to in _Section 5.1(d)(i)_, a violation of any Law to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case
of clause (B) or (C) above, for any such breach, violation, termination,
default, creation, acceleration or change that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

        

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

  

(i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the Securities Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")
under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ ") since May 31, 2004 (the " _Applicable Date_ ") (the forms,
statements, certifications, reports and documents filed or furnished since
the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished subsequent to the date
hereof, including any amendments thereto, the " _Company Reports_ "). Each of
the Company Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished complied
or, if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of their respective dates
(or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment),
the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed or furnished with
the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
NASDAQ.

  

(iii) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or, in the case
of Company Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows
included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including
any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or
in the case of Company Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations,
retained earnings and changes in financial position, as the case may be, of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods set forth
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the absence of
information or notes not required by GAAP to be included in interim financial
statements and to normal year-end adjustments), and in each case have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis, except as may be noted therein.

  

(iv) The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain a system
of internal accounting controls and financial reporting (as required by Rule
13a-15(a) under the Exchange Act) that are sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company
maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or
15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company
is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for
the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and other public
disclosure documents. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys outside
auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of the Company (A)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of its internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that would be reasonably likely to
materially and adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process,

material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting

Adverse Effect.

5.1(g) _of the Company Disclosure Letter without obligation of any further
review or inquiry, and does not include information of which they may be
deemed to have constructive knowledge only.

by Parent or Merger Sub from, any Governmental Entity in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger
Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other

prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the

each of Banc of America Securities LLC, Banc of America Bridge LLC, Bank of
America, N.A. and Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. (the " _Debt Financing

of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitment is in full force
and effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent
and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto so long as it
remains in effect. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set
forth in or contemplated by the Financing Commitments. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under
any of the Financing Commitments, and Parent has no reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated
by the Financing Commitments (subject to the Company complying with its
obligations hereunder and assuming that there will not be a Company Material
Adverse Effect). After giving effect to the amounts expected to be funded
under the Financing Commitments, and assuming compliance by the Company with
its obligations hereunder, Parent and Merger Sub will have at the Closing
funds sufficient, together with available cash of the Company, to pay the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration (and any repayment or refinancing of

(g) _Brokers_. No agent, broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for which the Company could have any
liability.

  

(h) _Solvency_. Assuming that the Company is solvent immediately prior to
the Effective Time and the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents
obligation to consummate the Merger, or waiver of such conditions, and
assuming the accuracy and completeness of the representations and warranties
of the Company contained herein, and after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, any alternative
financing and the payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration,
any other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in the Financing
Commitments, payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and payment of all
related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of
any date of determination, (i) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the
assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (A) the value of all
"liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as
of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance

such Person on its existing debts (including contingent and other
liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (ii) such Person will
not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the

purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of
capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due.

  

(i) _No Competing Businesses_. Except as set forth in _Section 5.2(i) _of

that are, engaged in the business or businesses of designing, manufacturing
or marketing musculoskeletal products.

  

(j) _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent
has caused the Guarantors to deliver to the Company the duly executed
Guarantees. Each of the Guarantees is in full force and effect and is the
valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the respective Guarantor, and no
event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default on the part of a Guarantor under its
respective Guarantee.

  

(k) _Proxy Statement_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the shareholders of
the Company and at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue

make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub make no representation or warranty with respect to any information
supplied by the Company or any of its representatives which is contained or
incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement.

  

(l) _Ownership of Shares_. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record) any
Shares and neither Parent nor Merger Sub holds any rights to acquire any
Shares except pursuant to this Agreement.

6.2. _Acquisition Proposals_.

  

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that, except as
expressly permitted by this _Section 6.2_, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of the Elected Officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors or representatives (such

        

directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants
and other advisors or representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_
") not to, directly or indirectly:

  

(i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or
the making of any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or may
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; or

  

(ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any
information or data to any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal.

  

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time,
but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company may (A)
provide information or data in response to a request therefor by a Person who
has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if (x) the
Company receives from the Person so requesting such information an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms that are no less favorable
(including with respect to standstill provisions) than those contained in the
confidentiality agreements signed by certain affiliates of Parent and (y) the
Company substantially concurrently provides to Parent any non-public
information provided to such Person which was not previously provided to
Parent; or (B) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with
any Person who has made such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal; if and only to the extent that, (1) the Company has not breached
this _Section 6.2_ with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, (2) prior to
taking any action described in clause (A) or (B) above, the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel that failure to take **** such action would be
inconsistent with the directors **** fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
and (3) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the board
of directors of the Company has determined in good faith based on the
information then available and after consultation with its financial advisor
and legal counsel that either (i) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal or (ii) there is a reasonable likelihood that such
Acquisition Proposal will result in a Superior Proposal.

  

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

  

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to
a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution,
liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction or (ii) any other direct or
indirect acquisition, in the case of clause (i) or (ii), involving 15% or
more of the total voting power or of any class of equity securities of the
Company, or 15% or more of the consolidated total assets (including equity
securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
involving more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or total
voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the board of
directors of the Company has determined in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is
reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the proposal and
the Person making the proposal, and would, if consummated, result in a
transaction superior to the Company than the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

(c) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.
The board of directors of the Company shall not:

  

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation with respect to the Merger; or

  

(ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, an
Acquisition Proposal or cause or permit the Company to enter into any
acquisition agreement, merger agreement,

        

letter of intent or other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal or enter into any agreement requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 6.2(c)_,
prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if
the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which the board of directors of
the Company concludes in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel and its financial advisors constitutes a Superior Proposal after
giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which
may be offered by Parent including pursuant to this _Section 6.2(c)_, the
board of directors of the Company may at any time prior to obtaining
the Requisite Shareholder Vote, if it determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (x) withhold,
withdraw or qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Recommendation (a " _Change in Recommendation_ ") and/or (y) terminate
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal; _provided_ that the Company shall not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination
pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect,
unless in advance of or concurrently with such termination the Company pays
the Termination Fee, as required by _Section 8.5(b)_; and _provided_ ,
further that the board of directors of the Company may not withdraw, modify
or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent
pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
the foregoing clause (y) unless (A) the Company shall not have breached this
_Section 6.2_ with respect to such Superior Proposal and (B) the Company
shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least five business
days (or three business days in the event of each subsequent material
revision to such Superior Proposal) in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of
its intention to take such action with respect to such Superior
Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any
such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such
Superior Proposal), and, if available, shall have contemporaneously provided
a copy of the proposed definitive transaction agreement with the party making
such Superior Proposal and other material related documents (the "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "); and (C) prior to effecting such
Change of Board Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice
Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal,
the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and
to comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.2(c) _with respect to
such new written notice.

  

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section
6.2_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the board of directors of the
Company from complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or
state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and
disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
shareholders), provided that any disclosure other than a "stop-look-and-
listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to
the shareholders of the Company) shall be deemed to be a "Change in
Recommendation" unless the Companys board (i) expressly rejects the
applicable Acquisition Proposal or (ii) expressly reaffirms its
recommendation to its shareholders in favor of the Merger.

  

(e) _Notice_. The Company agrees that, in addition to the other obligations
of the Company set forth in this _Section 6.2_, it will promptly notify
Parent orally and in writing **** of its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal
by indicating, in connection with such notice, the material terms and
conditions thereof and the

        

identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, and thereafter
shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and
terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any amendments thereto).

  

(f) _Breaches by Representatives_. The Company agrees that any material
violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.2_ by any of its
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.2_ by the
Company.

  

6.3. _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall prepare and file the Proxy
Statement in preliminary form with the SEC as promptly as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, but in any event by January 31, 2006. The Company

to filing the same with the SEC. The Company agrees, as to itself and
its Subsidiaries, that at the date of mailing to shareholders of the Company
and at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, (a) the Proxy Statement will
comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (b) none of the
information supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

6.4. _Shareholders Meeting_. The Company, acting through its board of
directors, shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and its articles of
incorporation and bylaws, all reasonable action necessary to convene a
meeting of holders of Shares (the " _Shareholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement to consider and
vote upon the approval of the "plan of merger" (as such term is used in
Section 23-1-40 of the IBCL) contained in this Agreement. Except in the event
of a Change in Recommendation permitted by _Section 6.2(c)_, (a) the Proxy
Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation and (b) the board of
directors of the Company shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit
the Requisite Company Vote. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with its terms pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_ , the Company shall
submit this Agreement to its shareholders at the Shareholders Meeting even if
its board of directors shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified its
recommendation thereof or otherwise effected a Change in Recommendation or
proposed or announced any intention to do so.

  

6.5. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

orders of, the relevant federal, state, local or foreign court or

        

Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable

accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to resist, vacate,
modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate, avoid or remove such actual,

confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure or
(b) to disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or

directed to the individual or other Person designated by the Company. All

and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such
Indemnified Parties service as a director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at the request of the
Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for
the extension of (i) the Side A coverage part (directors and officers
liability) of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance
policies, and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least

the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as the Companys existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged
error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of
duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that
existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby). If Parent and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to
obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, there shall
be no breach of this provision so long as the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time
the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the
Companys directors and

        

officers as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the

hereof; _provided_  that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of
300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance;
_provided_   _further_ that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.11_.

Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by

approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions

such statute or regulation on such transactions.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as

Commitment (provided that Parent and Merger Sub may replace or amend the Debt
Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities which had not executed the Debt Financing
Commitment as of the date hereof, or otherwise so long as such replacement or
amendment would not adversely impact or delay in any material respect the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the likelihood of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect
the Debt Financing Commitment, subject to the foregoing replacement and
amendment rights, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to
Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment that are within their control (including by consummating

set forth in _Section 7.1_,  _Sections 7.2(a)_, _7.2(b) _and _7.2(c)
_and the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.3_, at the Closing Parent shall draw down on the Financing if the
conditions to the Debt Financing Commitment are then satisfied (other than,
in connection with the Debt Financing, the availability of

        

funding of any of the Equity Commitments). Without limiting Parents
obligations under this _Section 6.13_, if any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Financing Commitment, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms
not materially less beneficial to Parent and Merger Sub in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but in no
event later than the Termination Date. Parent shall give the Company prompt
notice of any material breach by any party to the Financing Commitments of
which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, or any termination of the Financing
Commitments. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current
basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide

and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the respective officers, employees and advisors, including
legal and accounting, of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to
Parent and Merger Sub all cooperation reasonably requested in writing by
Parent that is reasonably necessary or customary in connection with the
Financing (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), including (i) participating in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with
rating agencies, (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts to assist with
the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering
documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,

the Financing, (iii) using commercially reasonable best efforts to furnish
Parent and Merger Sub as promptly as reasonably practicable with financial
and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as
may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing
and customarily included in private placement memoranda relating to private
placements under Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act to consummate
the offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by the Debt Financings
Commitments at the time during the Companys fiscal year such offering(s)
will be made as soon as such financial and other information becomes
available, including all financial statements and financial data of the type
required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act (other

and without giving effect to the executive compensation and related person
disclosure rules related to SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A; 34-54302A; IC-27444A),

requested by Parent and, if reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub, to
cooperate with and assist Parent or Merger Sub in obtaining such
documentation and items, (v) using commercially reasonable efforts to provide
monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) within the time frame, and

pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other
certificates, legal opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested by
Parent (including a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters) and
otherwise reasonably facilitating, to the extent reasonably requested by
Parent, the pledging of collateral (including cooperation, to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent, in connection with the pay-off of existing
indebtedness and the release of related Liens), (vii) taking all actions to
the extent reasonably requested by Parent necessary to (A) permit the
prospective lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the Companys
current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and

        

procedures relating thereto for the purposes of establishing collateral
arrangements and (B) establish bank and other accounts and blocked account
agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the foregoing, and

Closing, reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the consummation
of the Debt Financing by Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
immediately following the Effective Time; _provided_ that none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or incur any other cost or expense that is not
simultaneously reimbursed by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing
prior to the Effective Time. In the event that prior to September 30, 2007
(x) all or any portion of the Debt Financing structured as high yield
financing has not been consummated and (y) all closing conditions contained

incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and

"Marketing Period" shall not be deemed to have commenced if, prior to the
completion of the Marketing Period, (A) Ernst and Young LLP shall have
withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any financial statements
contained in the Required Financial Information, in which case the Marketing

another independent registered accounting firm reasonably acceptable to
Parent, (B) the Company shall have announced any intention to restate any of
its financial information included in the Required Information or that any

Reports have been amended or the Company has announced that it has concluded
that no restatement shall be required in accordance with GAAP or (C) the
Company shall have been delinquent in filing any report with the SEC, in

such delinquencies have been cured; and (z) if the financial statements
included in the Required Information that is available to Parent on the first
day of any such 20-consecutive-day period would not be sufficiently current
on any day during such 20-consecutive-day period to permit (i) a registration

is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) 30 days after written notice thereof
is given by the Company to Parent or (ii) two business days prior to the
Termination Date; _provided_  that the Company is not then in breach of this
Agreement such that any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a) _or 
_Section 7.2(b) _would not be satisfied; or

  

(c) if (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _7.2_ shall
have been satisfied (other than the delivery of the officer certificates
referred to in _Sections 7.2(a)_, _7.2(b) _and  _7.2(c)_ ) and (ii) on the
earlier of (A) 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the Termination Date or (B)
5:00 p.m., New York City time on the last day of the Marketing Period (or, if
earlier, such date designated by Parent in accordance with _Section

such time, including because none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation shall have obtained the proceeds pursuant to the Debt Financing
(or alternative debt financing as set forth in _Section 6.13(a)_) sufficient
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

8.4. _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by action of
the board of directors of Parent if:

  

(a) (i) the board of directors of the Company shall have (A) made a Change
in Recommendation or (B) recommended to the shareholders of the Company
an Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger or (ii) the board of
directors of the Company shall have failed to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement to the extent required pursuant to
_Section 6.4_; or

        

(b) there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Company in this Agreement such that _Section 7.2(a)
_or  _7.2(b) _would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not
curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) 30 days
after written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company or (ii) two
business days prior to the Termination Date; _provided_ that Parent and Merger
Sub are not then in breach of this Agreement such that the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.3(a) _and  _Section 7.3(b) _would not be satisfied.

  

8.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ , this Agreement shall become void
and of no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any party
hereto (or of any of its Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_ that (i)
except as otherwise provided in _Sections 8.5(g)_ , _9.5(c) _and  _9.5(d)_ ,
no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or
damages to the other party hereto resulting from any willful **** or
intentional material breach of this Agreement (it being understood that any
such liability or damages for which the Company may become liable shall be
calculated net of the amount of the Termination Fee, if previously paid by
the Company) and (ii) the provisions set forth in the second sentence of
_Section 9.1_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a) _or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_, then the Company
shall pay a termination fee of $272,500,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") as
directed in writing by Parent, at the time of termination in the case of
a termination pursuant to _Section 8.3(a) _or promptly (but in any event
within two business days following termination of this Agreement in the case
of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_.

  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by:

  

(i) Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_, and (x) at any time
prior to the termination an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced
or publicly made known and not withdrawn and (y) within nine months after
such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not the same as that originally announced or made
known), then, (i) in the event that a definitive agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal is entered into, on the date of such execution, the
Company shall pay 50% of the Termination Fee, and on the date of such
consummation, the Company shall pay the balance of such Termination Fee, and
(ii) in the event that an Acquisition Proposal is otherwise consummated, on
the date of such consummation, the Company shall pay the Termination Fee;

  

(ii) Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.2(b) _(or, after the
Shareholder Meeting has been held and a vote on the adoption of
this Agreement has been taken and there has been a failure by the Company to
obtain the Requisite Company Vote, and this Agreement thereby becomes
terminable for this reason, the Company terminates this Agreement for another
reason), and (x) prior to the Shareholder Meeting an Acquisition Proposal has
been publicly announced or publicly made known and not withdrawn and (y)
within nine months after such termination the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same as that
originally announced or made known), then, (i) in the event that a definitive
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal is entered into, on the
date of such execution, the Company shall pay 50% of the Termination Fee, and
on the date of such consummation, the Company shall pay the balance of such
Termination Fee less the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.5(d) _by the Company, and (ii) in the event
that an Acquisition Proposal is otherwise consummated, on the date of, and as
a condition to, such consummation, the Company shall pay the Termination Fee
less the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.5(d) _by the Company; or

   

37   

   

(iii) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(b)_, and (x) prior to the breach
giving rise to the right of termination, an Acquisition Proposal has been
publicly announced or publicly made known and not withdrawn and (y) within
nine months after such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same as that originally announced or
made known), then, (i) in the event that a definitive agreement with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal is entered into, on the date of such execution,
the Company shall pay 50% of the Termination Fee, and on the date of such
consummation, the Company shall pay the balance of such Termination Fee and
(ii) in the event that an Acquisition Proposal is otherwise consummated, on
the date of such consummation, the Company shall pay the Termination Fee.

  

For purposes of this _Section 8.5(c)_, the term "Acquisition Proposal"
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 6.2(b)_, except
that all references to 15% therein shall be deemed to be references to
"more than 50%".

  

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent, on the one
hand, or the Company, on the other hand, pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)
_under circumstances in which the Termination Fee is not then payable
pursuant to this  _Section 8.5_, then the Company shall pay promptly (but
in any event within two business days) following receipt of an invoice
therefor all of Parents actual and reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees
and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) actually incurred
by Parent and its affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Parent Expenses_ ") as directed by Parent in writing, which amount shall not
be greater than $40,000,000; provided, however, that the existence of
circumstances that could require the Termination Fee to become subsequently
payable by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.5(c)(ii) _shall not relieve the
Company of its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this
_Section 8.5(d)_; _provided_ _further_ , that the payment by the Company of
Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section 8.5(d) _shall not relieve the
Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.5(c) _except to the extent indicated in _Section 8.5(c)(ii)_.

  

(e) In the event of termination of this Agreement by (i) the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.2(a) _and on the Termination Date the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ (other than
the delivery of the officer certificates referred to in _Sections 7.2(a)_, 
_7.2(b) _and _7.2(c)_ ) were satisfied or waived, or (ii) the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_, Parent shall pay the Company an amount, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to $272,500,000 (the "
_Parent Fee_ ") as promptly as possible (but in any event within two business
days) following such termination.

  

(f) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to _Section 8.5(b)_,  _8.5(c)_
, _8.5(d) _or  _8.5(e) _shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by the party entitled to
receive such payment. The parties hereto agree and understand that in no
event shall the Company or Parent be required to pay the Termination Fee or
the Parent Fee, respectively, on more than one occasion.

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) in the
circumstances in which Parent becomes obligated to pay the Parent Fee, the
Companys termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.2(a) _or 
_8.3(c)_ , as the case may be, and receipt of payment of the Parent Fee
pursuant to _Section 8.5(e) _or the guarantee thereof pursuant to the
Guarantees shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its
Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors for any loss or
damage suffered as a result of the breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub and
the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of the Parent
Fee in accordance with _Section 8.5(e)_, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Guarantors shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (ii) in no event, whether or not this Agreement shall have
been

        

terminated, shall the Company be entitled to monetary damages in excess of
$272,500,000 in the aggregate, inclusive of the Parent Fee, if applicable,
for all losses and damages arising from or in connection with breaches of
this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or otherwise relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(h) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in _Section 8.5_
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due
pursuant to _Section 8.5(b)_,  _Section 8.5(c) _or _Section 8.5(d) _or
Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to _Section
8.5(e)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on the
one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a suit that results in
a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in _Section
8.5(b)_,  _Section 8.5(c) _or _Section 8.5(d) _or any portion thereof or
a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in _Section 8.5(e)
_or any portion thereof the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub, on the
one hand, or Parent shall pay to the Company, on the other hand, its costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of such amount or portion thereof at the
prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made through the date of payment.

the Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreements, dated
October 3, 2006, between the Company and each of the Guarantors or their
respective affiliates and the related letter agreements (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties
both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter
hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB NOR THE
COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH
HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE BY, OR
MADE AVAILABLE BY, ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR
IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY
OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY
DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE
FOREGOING.

  

9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section 6.11_
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) only, Parent and the
Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party
hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and
this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including, the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries
under _Section 6.11_ shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time
occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 9.3_
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of

        

the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than
the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in
this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of
the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

  

9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the
Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

  

9.10. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub
when due.

  

9.11. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex A_ is defined in
the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

  

9.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid
or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and
the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not
be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity
or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision,
or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  

9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_.

  

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of
reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a
reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference
shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

  

(c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective
Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of
this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

  

9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto (it being understood that Parent may be converted from a Delaware
limited liability company to a Delaware corporation prior to the Effective
Time); _provided_ that prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the
Companys shareholders, Parent may designate, by written notice to the
Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary to be a
Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references
herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other subsidiary,
except that all representations and warranties made herein

        

with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary as
of the date of such designation, _provided_ that any such designation shall
not impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of the shareholders of
the Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of
this Agreement is void.
