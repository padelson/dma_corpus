in connection with the preparation of the Closing Date Working Capital
Statement available to Richardson and Richardsons Accountant, and shall make
the persons in charge of the preparation of the Closing Date Working Capital
Statement available for reasonable inquiry by Richardson and Richardsons
Accountant.



 

18 (c) Richardson shall notify the Buyer in writing as soon as practicable, and
in no event more than thirty (30) days, following receipt of the Closing Date
Working Capital Statement if it does not agree with the Closing Date Working
Capital set forth thereon, in which case the Buyer and Buyers Accountant, on
the one hand, and Richardson and Richardsons Accountant, on the other, will
use good faith efforts during the fifteen (15) day period following the date
the Buyer received such notice from Richardson to resolve any differences they
may have as to the Closing Date Working Capital. If Richardson fails to
notify Buyer in writing within such thirty (30) day period that it does not
agree with the Closing Date Working Capital set forth on the Closing Date
Working Capital Statement, then the Closing Date Working Capital reflected
therein shall be deemed to have been accepted by Richardson. Such written
notice will identify with reasonable specificity the calculations with which
Richardson disagrees or Richardsons other bases for such disagreement. If
Richardson and the Buyer cannot reach agreement during such fifteen (15) day
period, they shall submit their disagreements within ten (10) days after the
expiration of such fifteen (15) day period to an independent, nationally-
recognized public accounting firm jointly selected by Richardson and the Buyer
(the "Independent Accountant"), which shall conduct such additional review as
is necessary to resolve the specific disagreements referred to it and, based
thereon, shall determine the Closing Date Working Capital. The Independent
Accountant shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator, and, in resolving
the disagreements referred to it, shall review the disagreements referred to
it in accordance with GAAP, consistent with the Financial Statements, and in
accordance with Richardsons accounting principles as disclosed on _Disclosure
Schedule 2.7(a)_. If the Parties are unable to jointly select an Independent
Accountant within the ten (10) day period, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall be
deemed to have been selected as the Independent Accountant. The review of the
Independent Accountant will be restricted as to scope to address only
those matters as to which Richardson and the Buyer have not reached agreement
pursuant to the preceding sentence. The Independent Accountants determination
of the Closing Date Working Capital, which shall be completed as promptly as
practicable but in no event later than twenty (20) days following its
selection, shall be confirmed by the Independent Accountant in writing to, and
shall be final and binding on, each of Richardson and the Buyer for all
purposes.

 

(d) If the Closing Date Working Capital as determined by the Independent
Accountant is closer to the Closing Date Working Capital advocated by (i)
Richardson than it is to the Closing Date Working Capital advocated by the
Buyer, the Buyer shall pay the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent
Accountant for services rendered pursuant to this Section or (ii) the Buyer
than it is to the Closing Date Working Capital advocated by Richardson,
Richardson shall pay the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent
Accountant for services rendered pursuant to this Section.

 

(e) In the event that the Closing Date Working Capital determined in
accordance with subparagraphs (b) and (c) of this Section 2.7, as the case
may be (the "Final Working Capital") is greater than the Estimated Working
Capital, Buyer shall, within three (3) Business Days following the date of
determination of the Final Working Capital (the "Determination Date"), pay to
each applicable Seller, an amount equal to such Sellers share of the
difference between the Final Working Capital and the Estimated Working Capital
as determined pursuant to paragraph 3 of _Exhibit F_.



 

19 (f) In the event that the Final Working Capital is less than the Estimated
Working Capital, each applicable Seller shall, within three (3) Business Days
following the Determination Date, pay to the Buyer or Affiliate of the Buyer
(as applicable), an amount equal to such Sellers share of the difference
between the Estimated Working Capital and the Final Working Capital as
determined pursuant to paragraph 3 of _Exhibit F_.

2.8 _Taxes_. 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, Richardson shall pay or cause to be
paid all transfer, documentary, sales, use, value-added, property, gross
receipts, stamp, registration or other similar Taxes (other than any value
added or similar taxes which are or could be recoverable or refundable by
Buyer operating in the relevant jurisdiction using its reasonable efforts,
"Recoverable Taxes", provided that the Recoverable Taxes shall not include any
Taxes where the event entitling Buyer to the recovery or refund occurs more
than eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date) incurred in connection with
the transfer and sale of the Purchased Assets as contemplated by the terms of
this Acquisition Agreement, including all recording or filing fees, notarial
fees and other similar costs of Closing, that may be imposed,
payable, collectible or incurred, and the Buyer shall bear no responsibility
for any portion thereof. Any Recoverable Taxes shall be borne and paid solely
by Buyer. The Buyer and Richardson agree to use their best efforts to obtain
any certificate, including a resale certificate, or other document from any
Governmental Authority as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate
any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby). Except as otherwise provided herein,
Richardson shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall timely file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any Taxes
described in this Section 2.8(a), and, if required by applicable Law, the
Buyer will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 

(b) Richardson shall be responsible for preparing and filing, or causing to be
prepared and filed, (i) all Tax Returns of any Seller and (ii) all Tax
Returns relating to the Business and the Purchased Assets for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date. The Buyer shall prepare and
file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all other Tax Returns relating to
the Business and the Purchased Assets. Except with respect to any Recoverable
Taxes, Richardson shall pay or shall cause the appropriate Seller to pay (i)
those Taxes provided for in Section 2.8(a) and (ii) all Pre-Closing Period
Taxes applicable to the Business and the Purchased Assets. The Buyer will pay
for all Post-Closing Period Taxes applicable to the Business and the Purchased
Assets. In the case of any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, the Buyer
shall notify Richardson of any amounts due from Richardson or any of the
Sellers in respect of such Straddle Period no later than ten (10) days prior
to the date on which such Straddle Return is due, and Richardson shall remit,
or cause to be remitted, such payment to the Buyer no later than five (5)
days prior to the date such Straddle Return is due.

(c) Any Tax refunds and interest thereon that are received by the Buyer, and
any amounts actually credited against Tax payable by the Buyer for a Post-
Closing Period, that relate to Pre-Closing Periods shall be for the account of
Richardson, and the Buyer shall pay over to Richardson any such refund and
interest actually received thereon or the amount of any such



 

20  credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt or, in the case of a credit,
the time that such credit is claimed by the Buyer or an Affiliate on the
applicable Tax Return. In the event the Buyer fails to pay Richardson any
such amounts due under this Section 2.8(c) within the time period specified,
the Buyer shall pay, in addition to the amounts due, interest on such amount,
compounded annually, calculated using a 365 day year from the date of receipt
or entitlement thereto through the date prior to the date of payment at the
prime lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank as in effect from time to time.

 

(d) The Buyer and Richardson agree to furnish, or cause to be furnished, to
each other, upon written notice pursuant to Section 10.1, as promptly as
practical, such information (including reasonable access to books and records)
and assistance as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Return,
the conduct of any Tax audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any
claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax matter. The Buyer and Richardson
shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Tax audit or
other Tax proceedings and each shall execute and deliver such documents
as are reasonably necessary to carry out the intent of this Section 2.8(d).
Any Tax audit or other Tax proceeding shall be deemed to be a third party
claim subject to the procedures set forth in Section 9.4 of this Acquisition
Agreement. 

(e) The provisions of Part 1 of _Annex A-1_ , "Obligations of the Parties for
UK Tax Matters" shall apply in respect of the UK Business and shall have
effect as if set out in this Section 2.8(e).

2.9 _Allocation of Purchase Price; Exchange Rate Adjustment_.

(a) Exhibit F hereto provides the methodology that the parties will use for
purposes of determining (i) the allocation of the Closing Purchase Price
among the Sellers, and (ii) the allocation of Purchase Price, and any Assumed
Liabilities properly taken into account, among the Purchased Assets for U.S.
federal, state, local and, where applicable, foreign tax purposes.

(b) The allocation as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.9
and Exhibit F shall be binding on Richardson and the Buyer for all Tax
reporting purposes, and Richardson and the Buyer shall not take inconsistent
positions with respect to, and shall each use reasonable best efforts to
sustain, such allocation in any subsequent Tax audit or similar proceeding,
and each of Richardson and the Buyer agrees to cooperate with the other in
preparing IRS Form 8594 (to the extent required to reflect the allocation),
and to furnish the other with a draft copy of such form within a reasonable
period before its filing due date.

2.10 _Transfer of Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities_. 

(a) The entire beneficial interest in and to, and the risk of loss with
respect to, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, shall pass to
the Buyer when the legal title thereto shall be transferred to the Buyer.

(b) In the event that the legal interest in any of the Purchased Assets to be
sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed pursuant to this Acquisition
Agreement, or any claim,

 



 

21  right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, cannot be sold,
assigned, transferred or conveyed hereunder as of the Effective Time because
any waiting or notice period has not expired or any consents or approvals
required for such transfer have not been obtained or waived, then the legal
interest in the Purchased Assets shall not be sold, assigned, transferred or
conveyed. Richardson shall and shall cause the other Sellers to, at their
expense, and the Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates, at their expense,
to use reasonable best efforts to cooperate in obtaining such consents or
approvals as may be necessary to complete such transfers as soon
as practicable. If any such consent shall not be obtained, Sellers shall
cooperate with the Buyer in any reasonable arrangement designed to provide for
the Buyer the benefits intended to be assigned to the Buyer under the relevant
Assumed Real Property Leases, Leased Personal Property, Assumed Contracts and
Assumed Licenses, including enforcement at the cost and for the account of the
Buyer of any and all rights of Sellers against the other party thereto arising
out of the breach thereof by such other party or otherwise. If and to the
extent that such arrangement cannot be made, the Buyer shall have no
obligation pursuant to _Section 2.3_ or otherwise with respect to any such
Assumed Real Property Lease, Leased Personal Property, Assumed Contract or
Assumed License.

(c) In the event that the Buyer provides written notice to the Sellers within
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing that certain of the Assumed
Contracts will not be included in the Purchased Assets, then all such Assumed
Contracts identified therein shall not constitute Assumed Contracts and shall
not be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed to the Buyer; provided,
however, that there shall be no adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price as a
result thereof and, provided, further, that any and all Losses incurred by the
Sellers as a result thereof shall be borne and paid solely by the Buyer.

(d) Subject to Section 2.8, the Sellers shall bear all costs and
expenses associated with the assignment to the Buyer and its Affiliates of
all the Purchased Assets, and the recordation by them, of Intellectual
Property, _provided_ , that the responsibility for all costs and expenses
associated with the assignment to the Buyer and its Affiliates of all
software license agreements, information technology license or similar
agreements, and the recordation by them shall be allocated in accordance with
the Transition Services Agreement.

 

(e) As of the Effective Time, the Buyer agrees and undertakes to assume the
Assumed Liabilities and to duly and properly perform and discharge the
outstanding obligations of the relevant Seller under the Assumed Liabilities.

(f) The provisions of this  _Section 2.10_ shall not affect the right of the
Buyer not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Acquisition
Agreement if the condition to its obligations hereunder contained in _Section
7.4_ has not been fulfilled. Nothing in this Acquisition Agreement shall be
construed as an attempt to assign to the Buyer any legal interest in any of
the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities which, as a matter of law or by
the terms of any legally binding contract, engagement or commitment to which
any of the Sellers are subject, is not assignable without the consent of any
other party, unless such consent shall have been given.

 

2.11 _Withholding Taxes_. The Buyer and its designees shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable hereunder
amounts required to be



 

22  deducted and withheld under any provision of applicable federal, state,
local or foreign Tax Law, _provided_ , that the Parties agree to cooperate
with one another and take all reasonable actions to minimize such amounts
that need to be deducted and withheld. To the extent amounts are deducted and
withheld, such amounts will be promptly paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this Acquisition Agreement
as having been paid by the Buyer.

2.12 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing, the Parties shall do
such acts and timely execute and deliver such documents and instruments as may
be reasonably required to make effective the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

2.13 _Transfer of Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities in Italy_. With
specific regard to the transfer of the Business in Italy, by way of partial
derogation from the provisions of this Article II, Richardson and the Buyer
agree to cause, respectively, Richardson Electronics SRL, as a prospective
Seller, and Silverstar S.r.l., as a prospective Buyer, to commence as soon
as practicable after the execution of the Acquisition Agreement the procedure
provided for by section 47 of Law n.428 of 1990 which will be completed on the
25th day following receipt of the notice commencing such procedure, whereupon
Richardson Electronics SRL and Silverstar S.r.l. shall be deemed to have
adhered to the Acquisition Agreement in all respects only upon completion of
the mentioned procedure and, at Closing, shall enter into any transaction
which is necessary in order to consummate the purchase and sale of the
Business in Italy in accordance with all relevant provisions of the
Acquisition Agreement.

 

2.14 _UK Property Matters_. Notwithstanding anything in this Acquisition
Agreement to the contrary, the provisions of Part 1 of  _Annex A-2_ shall
apply in respect of the UK Leasehold Business Premises and have effect as if
set out in this Section 2.14.

principles of equity (other than lack of good faith and fair dealing, undue
delay, laches, waiver, estoppel, unclean hands, misrepresentation or duress)

28  same principal terms after the Closing subject to obtaining any Required

Lease, is in breach or default in any material respect under any such lease

Liability.

EMPLOYEES

5.1  _The Buyer s Obligations_.

(a) Where applicable Law or rules provide for the transfer of employment of
any Employee (except the UK Transferring Employees) upon a sale of the
Business, the Buyer and the Sellers shall take or cause to be taken such
actions as are required under applicable Law to accomplish such transfer of
employment of such Employee as a matter of law as of the Effective Time. The
Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall employ each Employee on terms comparable
to those offered by the Sellers or their Affiliates to such Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and, as and to the extent required by
Law, shall maintain terms and conditions of employment which replicate those
provided by the Sellers or their Affiliates immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Where applicable Law or rules do not provide for the transfer of
employment of any Employee upon a sale of the Business to the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, the Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, make
offers of employment in accordance with the provisions of this ARTICLE V, to
be effective as of the Closing, to all such Employees, in accordance with the
provisions of this ARTICLE V, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing
Date (or such longer period required by applicable Law, collective bargaining
agreement, trade union agreement or works council agreement), to be effective
as of the Closing. Except as otherwise provided in this ARTICLE V, each offer
of employment by the Buyer or its Affiliate to each such Employee shall in
each case provide for aggregate compensation that is comparable to that
aggregate compensation provided to such Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date and will not trigger any severance with respect to such Employee.
For a period of not less than one year following the Effective Time,
the Buyer shall not modify the salary or benefits of any Transferred Employee
in any manner that will materially and adversely affect the aggregate value of
the compensation and benefits with respect to such Transferred Employee.

 

(b) (i) The Buyer and the Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to take, or to
cause to be taken, any and all required actions necessary to minimize to the
greatest extent practicable the possibility that severance benefits and/or
government-required termination liabilities shall be payable to an Employee
regardless of whether or not such Employee is offered employment by the
Buyer or one of its Affiliates or accepts the Buyers or one of its
Affiliates offer of employment.

(ii) To the extent the payment of statutory or contractual severance or long
service benefits and/or government-required termination liabilities, including
without limitation any health insurance premiums paid in respect of former
Employees, (the "Severance Costs") to any Employee is required,
notwithstanding that the Buyer or one of its Affiliates has employed, or made
an offer of employment to, such Employee in accordance with the provisions of
this Acquisition Agreement, and regardless of whether such Severance Costs
are incurred by Seller directly or through any other Person, such Severance
Costs with respect to Employees shall be the responsibility of the Buyer,
except for any liability that arises as a result of any actions or inactions
taken by the Sellers or their Affiliates prior to the Closing that are not in
accordance with this Acquisition Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

41 (iii) The Sellers shall indemnify the Buyer and its Affiliates and hold
them harmless from and against any Losses which may be incurred or suffered
by any of them in connection with any claim made by any Person with respect to
the termination or deemed termination of employment or services arising solely
as a result of any action or inaction of Sellers or their Affiliates with
respect to any Person prior to the Closing Date, other than with respect to
termination or deemed termination of employment or services of such Employees
in accordance with this Acquisition Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(iv) The Buyer shall indemnify the Sellers and their Affiliates and hold them
harmless from and against any Losses which may be incurred or suffered by any
of them in connection with any claim made by any Person with respect to the
termination or deemed termination of employment or services of such Person on
or after the Closing Date or in accordance with this Acquisition Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, other than Losses indemnified against by
Sellers and their Affiliates pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(iii).

 

(c) Except with respect to Transferred Employees who receive severance as a
result of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, unless
otherwise required under applicable Law, the Buyer shall credit (or cause to
be credited) service accrued by Transferred Employees with, or otherwise
recognized for purposes of comparable benefit plans, programs policies or
arrangements by, the Sellers as of the Effective Time for the purposes of
determining eligibility and vesting of benefits (but not accrual of benefits)
under Buyers Employee Benefit Plans and for all statutory entitlements.

 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this Acquisition Agreement, the Sellers
shall be responsible for the payment of all wages and other remuneration due
to Employees with respect to their services as employees of Seller through the
close of business on the Effective Time, including a pro rata portion of all
earned incentive compensation through the close of business on the
Effective Time (determined based on the achievement of performance criteria
through such date but without regard to any end of year service requirement)
and all vacation pay accrued on or before the Effective Time. Other than
equity-based compensation, any incentives, benefits or other remuneration
subject to vesting, shall be vested at the Effective Time and, except as
otherwise provided in this Acquisition Agreement, paid by the Sellers. The
Buyer shall be responsible for all payments, including any wages, that may be
payable to any Employees after the Effective Time, whether or not such
Employee is a Transferred Employee, which payments arise as a result of such
Employees termination of his or her employment and which are payable
for some period of time after such Employee has provided his or her notice of
termination.

(e) Each Transferred Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in welfare benefit plans of the Buyer or one of its
Affiliates made available to such Transferred Employee (to the extent that
coverage replaces coverage under a comparable welfare benefit plan of a
Seller, in which such Transferred Employee participated immediately prior to
the Closing). For purposes of each welfare benefit plan of the Buyer or one of
its Affiliates providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any



 

42  Transferred Employee, the Buyer shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively at work requirements of such plans to be waived for
such Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents (other than and
except to the extent any limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such Employees and dependents and that have not been
satisfied as of the Effective Time).

 

(f) With respect to Benefit Plans in which benefits are subject to co-
payments, deductibles or similar thresholds, the Buyer or one of its
Affiliates will take any and all required actions necessary to give full
credit for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Effective
Time in the same plan year as if there had been a single continuous employer
and shall take into account any amounts previously paid and thresholds
previously met for the benefit of each Transferred Employee towards any
applicable annual and/or lifetime maximum benefits.

 

(g) With respect to all Transferred Employees, the Buyer will recognize all
accrued and unused vacation days and/or holidays and any personal and
sickness days which have accrued to such Employees through the Effective Time
and which are reflected and have been accrued in the Closing Date Working
Capital Statement, and the Buyer will allow the Transferred Employees to take
such accrued vacation days and any personal and sickness days which have
accrued to such Transferred Employee following the Effective Time in
accordance with the policies of the Buyer, as in effect as of the Effective
Time; provided, however, that such accrued vacation, personal and sick days
shall not be recognized by the Buyer to the extent (i) the Sellers have chosen
to satisfy such obligations prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) that such
obligations are retained by the Sellers pursuant to Section 5.1(d).

(h) To the extent that the Buyer or its Affiliates provide for retirement
savings plans to the U.S. Transferred Employees, the Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Affiliates to, facilitate the rollover of accounts and accrued
benefits of a U.S. Transferred Employee from the Sellers retirement savings
plans to the Buyers retirement savings plans in respect of such U.S.
Transferred Employee if the U.S. Transferred Employee so requests, to the
extent permitted by Law and the Buyers or Affiliates retirement savings
plan.

 

(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Acquisition Agreement, the Buyer
shall not assume any obligations to any Employee (except, in relation to the
UK Transferring Employees, to the extent required by the Transfer
Regulations), including, without limitation, any obligations or liabilities
for employment, compensation, severance and employee-benefit related
Liabilities, obligations and commitments (including, but not limited to,
claims for wrongful dismissal, constructive dismissal, notice of termination
of employment, pay in lieu of notice or termination, termination indemnities
or other indemnities, any damages arising from a breach of an Employees
employment contract, and any payments required to be made under any Law of any
jurisdiction or the applicable collective bargaining agreement in respect of
the termination of an Employees employment including payments in respect of
accrued wages, vacation, overtime, bonuses and other plans, programs or
obligations) incurred on or prior to the Closing Date that relate to any
current or former officer, director, employee or independent contractor of
the Business including any Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof).
The Buyer is not assuming any of the Benefit Plans of the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates, and

 



 

43  the Buyer shall have no liability whatsoever to Employees of the Sellers
with respect to accrued or future benefits under any such Benefit Plans
whether or not any such Employees are offered employment by, or become
employees of, the Buyer, and the Sellers shall defend, indemnify and hold the
Buyer harmless against any claims that they have liability under such Benefit
Plans. Except as provided in Section 5.1(b), the Sellers shall hold the Buyer
harmless from and against all direct and indirect costs, expenses and
liabilities of any sort arising from or relating to any claims by or on behalf
of the Employees in respect to severance pay or termination pay, all
liabilities relating to consultation requirements with any works council or
union and transfer or undertakings in the applicable foreign jurisdiction, and
similar obligations relating to the termination of such employees employment
with the Sellers or any of its Affiliates.

(j) The Buyers workers compensation program shall be responsible for all
claims for benefits that are based upon events or conditions occurring after
the Effective Time by participating U.S. Transferred Employees and Canadian
Transferred Employees. The Sellers workers compensation program shall be
responsible for all claims for benefits that are based upon events occurring
prior to the Effective Time by participating U.S. Transferred Employees and
Canadian Transferred Employees.

 

(k) The Sellers hereby forbear, and shall cause their Affiliates to forbear,
from the date of this Acquisition Agreement until the date that this
Acquisition Agreement may be terminated in accordance with Section 10.2, from
enforcing any rights or remedies that they may have with respect to the
solicitation of employment or employment by the Buyer of any Employee, any
claims or rights the Sellers may have against the Buyer or any such Employee
under any non-hire, non-solicitation, non-competition, confidentiality or
employment agreement or any cause of action based on similar rights arising by
contract, at common law or by statute or regulation, and the Sellers waive,
and shall cause their Affiliates to waive, any such rights or remedies as of
the Closing Date.

 

(l) The Sellers shall be responsible for providing any notices required under
the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and any rules or
regulations as have been issued in connection therewith, and similar state or
foreign Laws (jointly, referred to throughout this Acquisition Agreement as
the "WARN Act") to be given prior to the Closing Date, and shall
hold harmless and indemnify the Buyer from and against any liability or
damages resulting from a Sellers failure to comply with the WARN Act. The
Buyer shall be responsible for providing any notices required under the WARN
Act to be given on or after the Closing Date, and shall hold harmless and
indemnify the Sellers from and against any liability or damages resulting from
a Buyers failure to comply with the WARN Act, except to the extent that any
such failure is as a result of the actions of the Sellers prior to the
Closing Date.

(m) Except as provided in Section 5.1(b), the Sellers shall provide group
health coverage under Section 4980B of the Code to any individual receiving or
eligible to elect such coverage under the Sellers group health plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date and to any employee of such Sellers (and
his or her covered spouse and dependents) who does not become a Transferred
Employee and who loses group health coverage in connection with the
transactions contemplated in this Acquisition Agreement, _provided_ , that the
Buyer shall reimburse the Sellers for all post-Closing administrative
expenses in respect of Severance Costs incurred by the Sellers pursuant to the

respect to any Employee who does not become a Transferred Employee.

the Closing Date. The Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate in good faith to
the extent necessary to permit each of them to comply with the Standard

the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective

statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be

49  Acquisition Agreement, shall govern the obligation of each Party to provide
the other Party, or its Affiliates with Records, as defined herein, and other
information requested by Richardson or its Affiliates with respect to such
matter) and (c) preparing or reviewing the Closing Date Working Capital
Statement as referred to in Section 2.7(b). To the extent deemed necessary by

in writing, neither Richardson, nor the Buyer shall, for a period of six (6)
years following the date hereof or such longer period as retention thereof is
required by applicable Law, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of (or allow
the destruction, alteration or disposal of) any of the Records without first
offering to surrender to each other such Records, at its own cost and

will be required to be obtained by the Sellers on or prior to the Closing Date
(collectively, the "Required Consents"). The Buyer will provide reasonable
cooperation with the Sellers with respect to obtaining the Required Consents;
_provided_ that, the Buyer will not be obligated to make any payment or
expenditure with respect to obtaining the Required Consents. Each Seller shall
cooperate with the Buyer in obtaining all Licenses and Permits necessary to
operate the Business which will not be a Purchased Asset.

6.7 _Antitrust Laws_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Acquisition Agreement, each of

the HSR Act, applicable Antitrust Law and any other Antitrust Laws as soon as
practicable. Fees payable to Governmental Authorities in connection with

Sellers and the Buyer, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the
Sellers be required to pay more than $100,000 of such fees.



 

50 (b) In connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.7(b) to obtain all
requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by
this Acquisition Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, each
of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any

private party, (ii) keep the other Parties informed in all material respects
of any material communication received by such Party from, or given by such
Party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") or any other Governmental Authority
charged with enforcing Antitrust Laws and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii)
permit counsel for the other Parties to review any material communication
given to it by, and to consult with each other in advance of any meeting or
conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority charged
with enforcing Antitrust Laws in connection with any proceeding by a
private party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
nothing contained in this Acquisition Agreement will require either Party or
any of its Affiliates to (A) enter into any agreement, consent decree or other
commitment requiring such Party or any of its Affiliates to divest, license
or hold separate any assets of such Party or any of its Affiliates, (B)
litigate, pursue or defend any action or proceeding in connection with any
Antitrust Laws or (C) in connection with Antitrust Laws or any order or

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in any
event, change, circumstance, condition, development or effect that, either
individually or in the aggregate with all other events, changes,
circumstances, conditions, developments or effects, would adversely affect the
business, condition (financial or otherwise), assets, Liabilities, operations
or results of operations of such party or any of its Affiliates, or on their
relationships with any of their customers, or any assets of the Business. In
connection with the foregoing, each Party will promptly notify the other Party
in writing of any communication received by that Party or its Affiliates from
any Governmental Authority charged with enforcing Antitrust Laws and, subject
to applicable Law, provide counsel for the other Party with a copy of any such
written communication (or written summary of any oral communication).

6.8 _Affiliate Agreements_. Each Seller will cause all Contracts or
other transactions between itself, on the one hand, and the other Sellers or
their Affiliates, on the other, as set forth on _Disclosure Schedule 6.8_ with
respect to which there could be further or continuing Liability or obligation
on the part of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including its subsidiaries
after the Closing) to be terminated prior to the Closing without any further
or continuing Liability on the part of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
other than the Transition Services Agreement and Manufacturing Agreement.

6.9 _Confidentiality; Announcements_.

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge that the terms, provisions and covenants of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until
Closing.

(b) The Buyer acknowledges that, in the course of its investigations of the
Business, the Buyer, its Affiliates and their representatives have and will

51  confidential information and confidential documents relating to the Excluded

Confidential Information"), and that its use of such confidential information
and documents, or communication of such information to third parties, could be
detrimental to the Sellers. All Other Confidential Information reviewed by the
Buyer, its Affiliates or their representatives in connection with this
Acquisition Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be kept
confidential and shall not (except as required by applicable judicial order,

representatives possession and confirm such destruction to Richardson in
writing or (y) promptly deliver to the disclosing Seller at the Buyers
own expense all copies of the written and electronic Other Confidential
Information; and (ii) the Buyer shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) keep
confidential and shall not use any Other Confidential Information unless
required to disclose such information or documents pursuant to judicial
order, regulation or law, and only after compliance with this Section 6.9(b).
If the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or representatives is requested pursuant
to, or required by applicable law, regulation or legal proceedings to
disclose any Other Confidential Information, the Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, (i) promptly notify Richardson in writing so that
Richardson may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or, in
Richardsons sole discretion, waive compliance with the terms of this Section
6.9 in such instance, and (ii) provide reasonable cooperation and assistance
to the Sellers in opposing or limiting the compelled or required disclosure.
In the event that no such protective order or other remedy is obtained, or
that Richardson waives compliance with the terms of this Section 6.9 in such
instance, the Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, furnish only
that portion of the Other Confidential Information, which the Buyer is
advised by counsel is legally required and will exercise all reasonable
efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such information and documents.

(c) Following the Closing, Richardson shall keep, and shall cause its
Affiliates to keep, confidential any non-public, proprietary, confidential
information, including any non-public, proprietary, confidential information
included in any Intellectual Property, know-how, trade secrets, customer
lists, details of any Contracts, pricing policies, operational methods,
marketing plans or strategies, products development techniques, plans or
processes of the Business ("Richardson Confidential Information") that they
may have and such information shall not (except as required by applicable
judicial order, regulation or law, and only after compliance with this Section
6.9(c)) be disclosed by Richardson or its Affiliates without the Buyers prior
written consent. If Richardson or any of its Affiliates or representatives is
requested pursuant to, or required by applicable law, regulation or legal
proceedings to disclose any Richardson Confidential Information, Richardson
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) promptly notify the Buyer
in writing so that the Buyer may seek a protective order or other appropriate
remedy or, in the Buyers sole discretion, waive compliance with the terms of
this Section 6.9 in such instance, and (ii) provide reasonable cooperation
and assistance to the Buyer in opposing or limiting the compelled or required
disclosure. In the event that no such protective

  

 

52  order or other remedy is obtained, or that the Buyer waives compliance with
the terms of this Section 6.9 in such instance, Richardson shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, furnish only that portion of the Richardson
Confidential Information, which Richardson is advised by counsel is legally
required and will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information and
documents.

(d) The Parties agree that no press release or other public statement
concerning the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Acquisition
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued or made
without the prior written approval of both Richardson and the Buyer (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as required by the rules
of any national securities exchange, national securities association or over-
the-counter market, foreign or domestic, as applicable, or applicable Law, in
which case the Party making such disclosure will first provide to the other
Party the text of the proposed disclosure, the reasons such disclosure is
required and the time and manner in which the disclosure is intended to be
made.

with the Liabilities assumed by the Buyer and the Liabilities retained by
Sellers pursuant to this Acquisition Agreement, each of the Parties hereto
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates and employees to, aid, cooperate with

Liabilities, by, among other things, providing such other Party with full
access to pertinent records at such times as such other party or parties may
reasonably request. With respect to the assignment of Intellectual Property,
Sellers and the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate for the purposes of
transferring the responsibility to administer and maintain the Intellectual

Richardson with respect to any liability resulting from the foregoing,
including, without limitation, the use of any such trademarks, service marks,
trade names, corporate names, brand names, domain names, logos or
other designations except to the extent such liability arises due to a defect
in any such trademarks, service marks, trade names, corporate names, brand
names, domain names, logos or other designations existing prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.12(a), at Closing the Sellers and the Buyer
shall enter into a trademark license agreement substantially in the form of

6.14  _Other Offers_.

(a) Subject to Section 6.14(b), from the date of this Acquisition Agreement
until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Acquisition Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2, Richardson shall not, nor
shall it authorize or permit any of its Affiliates, subsidiaries, or any of
its or their respective officers, directors or employees of, or any
investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative (collectively,
"Representatives") to (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or
encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or any other
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (each, a "Third Party
Acquisition Agreement") or (iii) directly or indirectly participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public
information with respect to, or knowingly take any other action to facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal



 

54 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.14(a), at any time
after the date of this Acquisition Agreement and prior to the receipt of the
Richardson Stockholder Approval, Richardson may, in response to an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal which did not result from a breach of Section 6.14(a),
(i) furnish information with respect to Richardson and its Affiliates to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a
customary confidentiality and standstill agreement not less restrictive of the
other party than the Confidentiality Agreement, except that such
confidentiality and standstill agreement between Richardson and such Person
shall not contain any provisions that would prevent Richardson from complying
with its obligations to provide the required disclosure to the Buyer pursuant
to this Section 6.14 and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with
such Person and its Representatives regarding any Acquisition Proposal, if the
Richardson Board (A) believes in good faith the Acquisition Proposal to be
bona fide, (B) determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and a qualified financial advisor) that the unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, (C) determines that the failure to take any of the above actions
would not be consistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
Richardson under Delaware Law and (D) complies in all material respects with
the requirements set forth in Section 6.14(e); provided, however, that
Richardson shall promptly provide to the Buyer any material non-public
information concerning Richardson or any of its Affiliates that is provided to
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or its Representatives which was
not previously provided to the Buyer. Upon execution of this Acquisition
Agreement, Richardson, its subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person previously conducted with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and will request, to the extent permitted
under the applicable confidentiality agreement, the prompt return or
destruction of any confidential information previously furnished to such
Persons that has not been previously returned to Richardson. Richardson shall
ensure that its Representatives are aware of the provisions of this Section
6.14, and any violation of the restrictions contained in this Section 6.14 by
its Board of Directors (including any committee thereof) or its
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.14 by
Richardson.

 

(c) (A) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.14(c), (i) the
Richardson Board and any committee thereof shall not (x) withdraw or modify,
or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Buyer,
its Richardson Board Recommendation (the "Richardson Withdrawal
Recommendation") or (y) approve or recommend or propose publicly to approve
or recommend to the holders of Richardson Common Stock, or otherwise permit or
cause Richardson to accept or enter into, an Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Richardson
Adverse Recommendation Change"), (ii) neither Richardson nor any of its
subsidiaries shall approve, recommend, publicly propose or enter into any
Third Party Acquisition Agreement, (iii) neither Richardson nor any of its
subsidiaries shall release any third party from, or waive any provisions of,
any confidentiality and standstill agreement to which Richardson is a party
except to the extent the Richardson Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal 



 

55  counsel) that the failure to so waive the applicable provisions of a
confidentiality or standstill agreement would not be consistent with the
Richardson Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Richardson under
Delaware Law, and (iv) neither the Richardson Board nor any committee thereof
shall agree or resolve to take any actions set forth in clause (i), (ii) or
(iii) of this sentence. (B) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the
Richardson Stockholder Approval, subject to Section 6.14(d), if the Richardson
Board (i) receives an Acquisition Proposal that has not resulted from a breach
of Richardsons obligations under this Section 6.14 and that it determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a qualified
financial advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (ii) determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to
take any of the following actions would not be consistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of Richardson under Delaware Law, then the
Richardson Board may (x) make a Richardson Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or (y) cause Richardson to enter into a Third Party Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal, but only if Richardson shall have
concurrently with entering into such Third Party Acquisition Agreement
terminated this Acquisition Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(viii).

(d) If the Richardson Board determines to effect a Richardson Adverse
Recommendation Change as provided in Section 6.14(c)(B)(ii)(x) or to authorize
the Sellers to enter into a Third Party Acquisition Agreement with respect to
Superior Proposal as provided in Section 6.14(c)(B)(ii)(y), such Richardson
Adverse Recommendation Change or Third Party Acquisition Agreement (as
applicable) may only become effective after the end of the fifth (5th) day
following the Buyers receipt of written notice from Richardson (a
"Richardson Adverse Recommendation Notice") advising the Buyer that the
Richardson Board intends to effect such Richardson Adverse Recommendation
Change, or to authorize Richardson to enter into such Third Party Acquisition
Agreement, which notice shall contain a copy of the Superior Proposal to which
such Richardson Adverse Recommendation Change or Third Party Acquisition
Agreement relates; provided that any material amendment to the terms of such
Superior Proposal after the initial Richardson Adverse Recommendation Notice
shall require a new Richardson Adverse Recommendation Notice and restart the
five (5) day period referred to above. In determining whether to effect a
Richardson Adverse Recommendation Change or to cause the Sellers to enter
into a Third Party Acquisition Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal,
in each case, as provided in Section 6.14(c), the Richardson Board shall
negotiate in good faith with Buyer and its Representatives (to the extent
Buyer desires to negotiate) with respect to any offer from Buyer and take into
account in good faith any changes to the terms of this Acquisition Agreement
proposed by the Buyer (in response to a Richardson Adverse Recommendation
Notice or otherwise) in determining whether such Acquisition Proposal still
constitutes a Superior Proposal.

 

(e) Richardson shall, within 48 hours of receipt of an Acquisition Proposal,
advise the Buyer orally and in writing of such Acquisition Proposal, and the
identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal and the material
terms of any such Acquisition Proposal. Richardson shall keep the Buyer
reasonably informed of the status (including any change to the terms thereof)
of any such Acquisition Proposal.



 

56 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.14 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit Richardson from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure other than (x)
a "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of Richardson
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the stockholders of Richardson), (y) an express rejection of
any applicable Acquisition Proposal or (z) an express reaffirmation of the
Richardson Board Recommendation to the stockholders of Richardson to vote in
favor of a resolution approving the transactions contemplated herein shall be
deemed to be a Richardson Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) making any
disclosure to Richardsons stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Richardson Board after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to
disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Richardson or the Richardson Board or any committee
thereof take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by _Section
6.14(c)_. Richardson shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any
Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal prior to the termination of this
Acquisition Agreement.

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer relating to a
possible (A) amalgamation, merger, consolidation, tender offer or similar

Business or any issuance, sale or other disposition that will close after the
Closing Date and shall not preclude the consummation of the Closing; (D)

the Closing; (E) transaction which is similar in form, substance or purpose to
any of the foregoing transactions; or (F) public announcement of an

Transition Services Agreement or the Manufacturing Agreement.

 



 

57 (ii) "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal made by a
third party (A) on terms which the Richardson Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with Richardsons outside legal counsel and qualified
financial advisors, to be more favorable from a financial point of view to
the holders of Richardson Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by
this Acquisition Agreement, taking into account all the terms and conditions
of such proposal, and this Acquisition Agreement (including any proposal by
the Buyer to amend the terms of this Acquisition Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Acquisition Agreement) and (B) that is
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,

not specifically directed at such Employees, (B) hire any Transferred
Employees while such person is, or was within the twelve (12) month period
prior to his or her offer of employment, an employee of Buyer or one of its
Affiliates, or (C) solicit, entice, induce or encourage any Transferred
Employees or any other employee, consultant or independent contractor of the
Buyer to terminate his, her or its relationship with the Buyer in order to
become an employee of, or a consultant or independent contractor to, a person
other than Buyer.



 

59 (d) Other than the solicitation of Employees contemplated by this Acquisition
Agreement, for a period of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date
(subject to any local Laws that may be applicable to any given employee), the
Buyer agrees that it shall take no action, formal or informal, direct or
indirect, to (A) solicit the employment of any person while such person is,
or was within the twelve (12) month period prior to his or her solicitation of
employment, an employee of the Sellers other than through general advertising
not specifically directed at such Employee, (B) hire any employee of a Seller
while such person is, or was within the twelve (12) month period prior to his
or her offer of employment, an Employee of such Seller or one of its
Affiliates (other than as provided in Section 5.1), or (C) solicit, entice,
induce or encourage any employee of the Sellers (other than in connection with
the Business) or any consultant or independent contractor of the Seller to
terminate his, her or its relationship with the Sellers in order to become an
employee of, or a consultant or independent contractor to, a person other than
a Seller.

(e) Each Party hereto acknowledges that the periods of restriction, the
geographical areas of restriction and the restraints imposed by the provisions
of this Section 6.17 are fair and reasonably required for the protection of
the other Party. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of this Section 6.17 is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope,
duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases
or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Acquisition Agreement will be enforceable against the parties as so modified.
Each Party hereto agrees that any violation of the covenants contained in
this Section 6.17 is likely to cause irreparable damage to the other Party;
therefore, in addition to any other remedies the other Party may have under
this Acquisition Agreement or otherwise, the other Party will be entitled to
seek an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction restraining the
Party violating the covenant or any of their Affiliates from committing or
continuing any violation of this Section 6.17, and the Party violating the
covenant shall not contest such injunctive relief on the basis that there is
an adequate remedy at law for any such violation or threatened violation of
this Section 6.17.

 

6.18 _Canadian Tax Covenants_.

 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 6.18 and notwithstanding
Section 2.8(a), the entity designated as the purchaser of assets from
Canadian Seller ("Canadian Buyer") shall pay to Canadian Seller or directly to
the appropriate Governmental Authorities as required by applicable Law, all
sales and transfer taxes, registration charges and transfer fees, including
all GST, HST and Quebec Sales Tax payable by it in respect of the purchase and
sale of the Canadian Purchased Assets under this Agreement. Canadian Buyer
shall indemnify Canadian Seller for any amounts, including interest
and penalties, that may be assessed against Canadian Seller arising out of
the failure of Canadian Buyer to pay, when due, any Taxes described in this
Section 6.18(a).

 

(b) In respect of the purchase and sale of the Canadian Purchased Assets under
this Agreement, the Canadian Buyer shall not require the Canadian Seller to
comply or



 

60  assist the Canadian Buyer to comply with the requirements of section 6 of
the Retail Sales Tax Act (Ontario) and any equivalent or corresponding
provision under any other applicable provincial or territorial tax
legislation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Canadian Seller shall
indemnify and save harmless the Canadian Buyer, its directors, officers,
employees, agents and shareholders, on an after Tax basis, from and against
all Losses incurred, directly or indirectly, arising from or as a result of
such non compliance.

(c) Canadian Seller and Canadian Buyer acknowledge and agree that the assets
sold by Canadian Seller constitute a business of Canadian Seller and comprise
all or substantially all of the property reasonably necessary for Canadian
Buyer to be capable of carrying on the business as a business. Canadian Buyer
and Canadian Seller shall jointly elect under subsection 167(1) of Part IX of
the Excise Tax Act (Canada), section 75 of the Quebec Sales Tax Act, and any
equivalent or corresponding provision under any applicable provincial or
territorial legislation imposing a similar value added or multi-staged tax,
that no tax be payable with respect to the purchase and sale of the Canadian
Purchased Assets under this Acquisition Agreement and shall make such
election(s) in prescribed form containing prescribed information. Canadian
Buyer shall file such election(s) in compliance with the requirements of the
applicable legislation.

 

(d) If proposed section 56.4 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) is enacted in a
form substantially similar to the one in Clause 27(1) of Special Release IT
10-6, _Draft Technical Income Tax Legislation and Explanatory (Technical)
Notes, Replacing Former Bill C-10 (2007)_ (July 16, 2010) and is applicable
to this Acquisition Agreement, then, in respect of the non-
competition covenants contained in this Acquisition Agreement, Canadian Buyer
and Canadian Seller agree to jointly execute any necessary or desirable
elections under section 56.4 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and any
corresponding provision of any applicable provincial tax legislation such
that (i) subsection 56.4(5) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (and any
corresponding provision of a provincial tax legislation) applies; (ii)
subsection 56.4(2) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (and any corresponding
provision of a provincial tax legislation) does not apply; and (iii) any
amount allocated by the parties to or regarded by a tax authority as being the
consideration for a "restrictive covenant" (within the meaning of subsection
56.4(1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and any corresponding provision of a
provincial tax legislation) shall be on account of capital. Canadian Seller
shall prepare all forms for the purposes hereof and file such elections,
together with such accompanying documents, as may be required, within the
prescribed delays. Canadian Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
Canadian Buyer in respect of any tax, penalties, and interest that may be
assessed against Canadian Buyer in respect of the non-competition covenants
contemplated by this Acquisition Agreement.

(e) If applicable, Canadian Buyer and Canadian Seller shall make the joint
election under subsections 20(24) and (25) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and
the comparable provisions of any applicable provincial legislation and
Canadian Buyer and Canadian Seller shall cooperate fully in the filing of
such elections in the manner required by the Income Tax Act (Canada) and
applicable provincial legislation. In accordance with the requirements of the
Income Tax Act (Canada), the regulations thereunder, the administrative
practice and policy of the Canada Revenue Agency and any applicable
equivalent or corresponding provincial or territorial legislative, regulatory
and administrative requirements, Canadian Buyer and Canadian 



 

61  Seller shall make and file, in a timely manner, a joint election(s) to have
the rules in Section 22 of the Income Tax Act (Canada), and any equivalent or
corresponding provision under applicable provincial or territorial tax Law,
apply in respect of the Accounts Receivable being sold by Canadian Seller and
shall designate that portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the Accounts
Receivable being sold by Canadian Seller in accordance with the allocation
described in Section 2.9.

6.19 _China Covenants_. The parties agree that all existing addresses of the
Seller entities in China may continue to be used by such entities as their
legal addresses (only for Chinese government record purposes and no other
purposes) for up to a period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing;
provided however, that if (i) applicable local Laws require that the Buyer
register its business activities at such addresses into appropriate forms of
business (including without limitation, branch companies) at the local
commerce authority and the local administration for industry and commerce;
and (ii) despite the reasonable efforts of the Buyer, the local commerce
authority and the local administration for industry and commerce refuses to
grant such registration at such addresses unless and until the applicable
Seller deregisters its existing legal addresses at such addresses, then the
Seller shall deregister their legal addresses at the Sellers costs within 90
days after the applicable Buyer so notifies the applicable Seller in writing.
Subject to the foregoing arrangement and the terms of any transitional
arrangements between the parties, (i) immediately following the Closing or at
a later time when the applicable Seller is considered under applicable laws
of the location of the relevant real property in China having changed its
legal address, such Seller shall file an address change for such change, and
(ii) such Seller shall, if reasonably requested by the Buyer,
provide assistance at Buyers cost and on Buyers account, to the Buyer for
Buyers registration of an appropriate form of business as may be required by
the applicable laws of the location of the relevant real property, provided
nothing here shall excuse the Buyer or any of its Affiliates in China from
obtaining any license or permit required for such entity to acquire the Assets
or operate the Business in China or employ such Employees pursuant to Section
5.1.

 

6.20 _Licenses and Permits_. Richardson shall and shall cause the other
Sellers to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and assist
the Buyer and its Affiliates (i) in transferring all transferrable Licenses
and Permits to the Buyer or its designated Affiliate to the extent such
Licenses and Permits are not necessary or desirable for Richardson or any of
the other Sellers after the Closing, and (ii) in obtaining for the Buyer of
its designated Affiliate, on a post-Closing basis, those Licenses and Permits
as may be necessary to operate and conduct the Business as now conducted or to
occupy any premises in which the Business is operated or conducted.

ARTICLE IX

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

9.1 _Indemnification by Richardson_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this ARTICLE IX, and notwithstanding the closing conditions set forth in
Section 7.1, Richardson shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and its
directors, shareholders, officers and Employees (in their capacity as such),
and its and their Affiliates and agents (in all, the "Buyer Indemnified
Persons") against and in respect of any and all Losses incurred directly or
indirectly, in connection with, arising from or as a result of:

 

(a) any breach, non-fulfillment or violation of the covenants made in this
Acquisition Agreement by Richardson or any of its Affiliates; 

(b) any breach of any of the representations and warranties made in this
Acquisition Agreement by Richardson;

 

(c) the ownership, use or possession of the Excluded Assets;

 

(d) the Retained Liabilities;

 

(e) the license granted to Sellers for the Richardson Software set forth on
Schedule 6.13; or

 

(f) any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or criminal acts committed by or
on behalf of any Seller or any of its Affiliates on or prior to the Closing
Date.

9.2 _Indemnification by the Buyer_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this ARTICLE IX, the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Richardson and
each Seller and its and their directors, shareholders, officers and employees
(in their capacity as such), and their Affiliates and agents against and in
respect of any and all Losses incurred directly or indirectly in connection
with, arising from or as a result of:

(a) any breach, non-fulfillment or violation of the covenants made in this
Acquisition Agreement by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates;

(b) any breach of any of the representations or warranties made in this
Acquisition Agreement by the Buyer;

(c) the Assumed Liabilities; or 



 

65 (d) any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or criminal acts committed by or
on behalf of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates on or prior to the Closing
Date.

9.3 _Notice and Payment of Losses_. Upon obtaining knowledge of any Loss, any
Person entitled to indemnification under Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 (the
"Indemnified Party") shall give written notice to the Party liable for such
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") specifying the facts constituting
the basis for such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim
asserted and any other relevant information in the possession of the
Indemnified Party (such written notice being hereinafter referred to as a
"Notice of Claim"). If the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim of
indemnification, it shall notify the Indemnified Party thereof within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the Notice of Claim. If the dispute has not been
resolved within thirty (30) days after the parties first meet to attempt such
resolution, either party may initiate litigation in accordance with this
Acquisition Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party does not dispute the
Indemnified Partys claim of indemnification, the Indemnifying Party shall
pay the amount of any valid claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
Indemnified Partys Notice of Claim.

 

9.4 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. If an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification hereunder because of a claim asserted by any claimant (other
than an Indemnified Party hereunder) ("Third Person"), the Indemnified Party
shall give a Notice of Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after such
assertion is actually known to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, and using
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to investigate,
secure, contest, or settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a "Third
Person Claim") at its sole cost and expense; _provided_ that the Indemnifying
Party notified the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to indemnify
the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Person Claim; and 
_provided_ _further_ that the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect to the matter or enter into any settlement with
respect to the matter without the written consent of the Indemnified Party
(not to be withheld or delayed unreasonably). The Indemnified Party may
thereafter participate in (but not control) the defense of any such Third
Person Claim with its own counsel at its own expense, unless separate
representation is necessary to avoid a conflict of interest, in which case
the Indemnifying Party shall assume the reasonable fees and expenses of such
representation. For the avoidance of doubt, a claim or challenge asserted by a
governmental agency, including without limitation, the IRS or the U.S.
Department of Commerce, against an Indemnified Party shall be considered a
Third Person Claim hereunder. In the event the Indemnifying Party elects not
to defend the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Person Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option, to assume and
control defense of the matter, and the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible
for the reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with such defense. In the event the Indemnifying Party does not
offer reasonable assurances to the Indemnified Party as to the Indemnifying
Partys financial capacity to satisfy any final judgment or settlement,
following a request from the Indemnified Party for such assurances, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option, to assume and control
defense of the matter on the same basis as the immediately preceding sentence.
The failure of the Indemnifying Party to respond in writing to the Notice of
Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof shall be deemed an
election not to defend the same. If the Indemnifying Party

 



 

66  does not so elect to indemnify and assume the defense of any such Third
Person Claim, (a) the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim, in such
manner as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling
such claim, after giving written notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party,
on such terms as the Indemnified Party may deem appropriate, and (b) the
Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) the defense of such
action, with its own counsel at its own expense. The Parties shall make
available to each other all relevant information in their possession relating
to any such Third Person Claim and shall cooperate in the defense thereof.

9.5 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. All of the representations
and warranties made by any Party in ARTICLE III and ARTICLE IV shall survive
following the Closing Date through and including March 31, 2012, and
thereafter to the extent a Notice of Claim is made within such period with
respect to any breach of such representation or warranty occurring within
such period and set out in such Notice of Claim; _provided_ that (a) the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1(a) and (c), 3.2,
3.3(a), 3.24, 4.1(a) and (c), 4.2 and 4.3 hereof shall survive the
Closing indefinitely, and (b) the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 3.8, 3.11, 3.15, 3.17, 3.20 and 3.21 hereof shall survive the Closing
until 30 days after the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to
the matters set forth therein. No party shall be entitled to indemnification
for breach of any representation and warranty set forth in ARTICLE III and
ARTICLE IV unless a Notice of Claim of such breach has been given to the
Indemnifying Party within the period of survival of such representation and
warranty as set forth herein.

9.6 _Limitation on Indemnification_.

 

(a) The provisions for indemnity under Sections 9.1(b) and 9.2(b) shall be
effective only when the Loss related to any individual item for which
indemnification is sought exceeds $10,000 (the "DeMinimis"), and such Losses
for which indemnification is sought (excluding any Losses that do not exceed
the DeMinimis) exceed U.S. $2,100,000 in the aggregate (the "Indemnification
Basket"), in which case the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification of the Indemnified Partys Losses only in excess thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnification Basket shall not apply in
any manner whatsoever to any breach of a representation or warranty contained
in Sections 3.1(a) and (c), 3.2, 3.3(a), 3.8 and 3.24 and Sections 4.1(a) and
(c), 4.2 and 4.3.

 

(b) The indemnification obligations of Richardson pursuant to Section 9.1(b)
shall be effective only until the dollar amount paid by Richardson in respect
of all Losses indemnified against under such Section aggregates U.S.
$42,000,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations on the
indemnification contained in this Section 9.6(b) shall not apply with
respect to (i) Losses arising under fraud, intentional misrepresentations or
criminal acts, (ii) Losses relating to matters covered by Sections 3.1(a) and
(c), 3.3(a), 3.8, and 3.24 or (iii) any obligation of Richardson to make
payment under Section 2.7(f).

(c) All indemnification obligations shall be paid in U.S. Dollars in the
United States, provided that to the extent that any indemnification
obligations arise out of amounts paid by an Indemnified Party in a currency
other than U.S. Dollars, such amount shall be converted to and be payable in
U.S. Dollars converted at the currency exchange rate reported in the Wall
Street Journal on the day prior to the date of any such payment, unless
required by local Laws to be payable in the local currency thereof.



  

67 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Acquisition Agreement to the contrary, no
Liability, obligation, contract or other matter shall constitute a breach of
any representation or warranty of Richardson or entitle the Buyer Indemnified
Persons to indemnification hereunder, to the extent, but only to the extent,
of the amount of such Liability, obligation, Contract or other matter was
provided for in the Closing Date Working Capital Statement.

(e) Any payment made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party
pursuant to this ARTICLE IX in respect of any claim (i) will be net of any
insurance proceeds received or receivable by the Indemnified Party in respect
of such claim and (ii) will be reduced by an amount equal to any Tax benefit
received or receivable by the Indemnified Party which are attributable to such
claim.

 

9.7 _Characterization and Calculation of Indemnity Payments_. Any
indemnification payments made pursuant to this Acquisition Agreement shall be
considered, to the extent permissible under Law, as adjustments to the Closing
Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

 

9.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. The indemnification provisions set forth in this
ARTICLE IX shall provide the exclusive remedy for breach of any covenant,
agreement, representation or warranty set forth in this Acquisition Agreement,
Related Agreements or any other agreement ancillary hereto executed pursuant
to this Acquisition Agreement.

except (i) any liability of the Sellers as provided in Section 10.2(c), and
(ii) that nothing shall relieve any Party from liability for fraud, bad faith
or any breach of this Acquisition Agreement; and _provided_ _further_
that where the Termination Fee (as defined below) is payable, the Sellers
shall have no other liability upon termination except for liability for any
willful and material breach prior to, or resulting in, such termination.

 

(c) In the event that (i) within eighteen (18) months after this Acquisition
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 10.2(a)(ii), 10.2(a)(iv) or
10.2(a)(vi) the Sellers



 

70  shall have entered into a definitive agreement for, or consummated, any
transaction involving 50% or more of the assets, voting securities or equity
securities of Richardson or the Sellers, including a transaction contemplated
by a Superior Proposal; or (ii) this Acquisition Agreement is terminated by
the Buyer pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(v) or by Richardson pursuant to Section
10.2(a)(viii), then the Sellers shall (A) in the case of termination
described in (c)(i) of this Section 10.2, upon the consummation of any
transaction for 50% or more of the assets, voting securities or equity
securities of Richardson or the Sellers, including a transaction contemplated
by a Superior Proposal, or (B) in the case of a termination described in
(c)(ii) of this Section 10.2, on the date of such termination, pay the Buyer
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by the Buyer a fee equal to (x) $8,400,000 (the "Termination Fee") and, in
addition, (y) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, actually documented and
incurred or payable by or on behalf of the Buyer in connection with or
in anticipation of the transactions contemplated by this Acquisition
Agreement and the Related Agreements (whether before or after the date of this
Acquisition Agreement), including all attorneys fees, financial advisors
fees, accountants fees and filing fees ("Termination Expenses"); _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall the Sellers be liable to the Buyer for
Termination Expenses in excess of $1,600,000, in the aggregate.

 

(d) The Buyer and the Sellers acknowledge and agree that the payment of the
Termination Fee and Termination Expenses as contemplated by Section 10.2(c)
is reasonable and not excessive in light of the nature of the transactions
contemplated by this Acquisition Agreement. If the Buyer has the right to
receive the Termination Fee and Termination Expenses pursuant to Section
10.2(c), such Termination Fee and Termination Expenses shall be the Buyers
exclusive remedy for any breach by the Sellers other than for fraud or bad
faith. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
this Section 10.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby and that, without these agreements, the Buyer would not enter into this
Acquisition Agreement. If the Sellers fail promptly to pay the Termination Fee
and Termination Expenses and, in order to obtain such payment(s), the Buyer
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Sellers for the
Termination Fee and Termination Expenses, the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer
its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with such suit.

10.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Acquisition Agreement and the Schedules,
Exhibits and Annexes hereto embody the entire agreement and understanding of
the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede
all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings relating to such
subject matter. The Parties hereto agree to execute such additional transfer
agreements as may be required by local law applicable to each Seller;
provided, however, that in the event of any conflicting provisions, the
provisions of this Acquisition Agreement shall prevail.

10.4 _Severability_. If any provision of this Acquisition Agreement is held
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and
if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Acquisition
Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (i)
such provision will be fully severable, (ii) this Acquisition Agreement will
be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (iii) the remaining
provisions of this Acquisition Agreement will remain in full force and effect
and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or
by its severance herefrom.

 



 

71 10.5 _Assignment; Binding Agreement_. This Acquisition Agreement and various
rights and obligations arising hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns.
Neither this Acquisition Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or
obligations hereunder shall be transferred, delegated, or assigned by the
Parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except that the Buyer shall have
the right to transfer and assign its rights hereunder to any entity which is
controlled by the Buyer or by the Affiliates of the Buyer. No such assignment
shall relieve the Buyer of any Liability or obligation hereunder.

 

10.6 _Counterparts_. This Acquisition Agreement may be executed simultaneously
in multiple counterparts, and in separate counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same instrument.

 

10.7 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided below or elsewhere herein, each
Party hereto will pay all costs and expenses incident to its negotiation and
preparation of this Acquisition Agreement and to its performance and
compliance with all agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to
be performed or complied with, including the fees, expenses and
disbursements of its counsel and accountants.

10.8 _Headings; Interpretation_. The article and section headings contained in
this Acquisition Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Acquisition Agreement.
Each reference in this Acquisition Agreement to an Article, Section, Schedule
or Exhibit, unless otherwise indicated, shall mean an Article or a Section of
this Acquisition Agreement or a Schedule or Exhibit attached to this
Acquisition Agreement, respectively. References herein to "days," unless
otherwise indicated, are to consecutive calendar days. All Parties have
participated substantially in the negotiation and drafting of this Acquisition
Agreement and agree that no ambiguity herein should be construed against the
draftsman. For the purposes of determining whether any amount of local
currency exceeds or is less than any U.S. Dollar amount referred to in this
Acquisition Agreement, the exchange rate prevailing on the relevant date (or,
if the relevant date is not a Business Day, on the immediately preceding
Business Day) as published in the Wall Street Journal shall be used.
References to a "corporation" or "company" shall be construed so as to include
any corporation, company or other body corporate, wherever and
however incorporated or established.

10.9 _Bulk Sales Laws_. The Buyer and Sellers each hereby waive compliance by
the Sellers with the provisions of the "bulk sales," "bulk transfer" or
similar laws of any state or province.

10.10  _Governing Law_. This Acquisition Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the law of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts to be carried out wholly within such State.

 



 

72 10.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each Party to this Acquisition Agreement
consents to submit to the non-exclusive personal jurisdiction of any federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Acquisition Agreement, agrees that all claims in
respect of the action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such
court and agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Acquisition Agreement in any other court. Each Party to this
Acquisition Agreement agrees not to assert in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Acquisition Agreement that the venue is
improper, waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security
that might be required of any other party with respect thereto.

10.12 _No Waiver_. No disclosure of information made in this Acquisition
Agreement or required to be made pursuant to this Acquisition Agreement shall
be deemed to constitute a waiver of the Attorney-Client privilege or Work
Product doctrine, or to the extent such disclosure could be so construed, the
Parties shall enter into a mutually acceptable agreement to protect such
disclosure.

10.13 _No Third Party Beneficiaries or Other Rights_. Nothing herein shall
grant to or create in any Person not a party hereto, or any such Persons
Affiliates, any right to any benefits hereunder, and no such party shall be
entitled to sue either Party to this Acquisition Agreement with respect
thereto. The representations and warranties contained in this Acquisition
Agreement are made for purposes of this Acquisition Agreement only and shall
not be construed to confer any additional rights on the Parties under
applicable state or federal or foreign securities laws.

10.14 _Amendment and Waiver_. Subject to Section 6.2, any provision of this
Acquisition Agreement may be amended or waived only if such amendment or
waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Richardson
and the Buyer, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom
the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.
