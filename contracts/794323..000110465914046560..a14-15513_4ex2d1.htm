"), among LEVEL 3 COMMUNICATIONS, INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),
SATURN MERGER SUB 1, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct
Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub 1_ "), SATURN MERGER SUB 2,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct Wholly Owned Subsidiary
of Parent (" _Merger Sub 2_ "), and TW TELECOM INC., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ ").

 



 

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 



 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company and the
respective Boards of Managers of Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 have each
approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub 1 with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and the
Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the " _DLLCA_ "), pursuant to which
each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, other than Dissenting Shares, will be converted into
the right to receive a combination of cash and shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ "); and

 



 

WHEREAS, immediately following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will then
merge with and into Merger Sub 2 (the " _Subsequent Merger_ " and together
with the Merger, the " _Combination_ ") in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company, and the
respective Boards of Managers of Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 deem it fair
to, advisable to and in the best interests of their respective company to
enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Combination and the other

WHEREAS, as a condition to the Company entering into this Agreement, and
incurring the obligations set forth herein, concurrently with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Company is entering into a voting
agreement with a certain stockholder (the " _Stockholder_ ") of Parent
pursuant to which, among other things, the Stockholder has agreed, subject to
the terms thereof, to vote all shares of Parent Common Stock it owns in
accordance with the terms of such voting agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger
Sub 2 and the Company intend that the Combination shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the regulations promulgated

authorizing this Agreement, to adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations; and

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with the transactions

      
 

 



 

contemplated hereby and also to prescribe various conditions to the

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I.**

 



 

 **THE COMBINATION**

 



 

 **Section 1.1.** ** ****_The Merger and the Subsequent Merger_** **.** Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the DGCL and the DLLCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub 1
will merge with and into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub
1 shall cease. The Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as
a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent and shall continue to be governed by the
laws of the State of Delaware (as such, the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").
Immediately after the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL and the
DLLCA, the Surviving Corporation will merge with and into Merger Sub 2, and
the separate existence of the Surviving Corporation shall cease. Merger Sub 2
shall continue as the surviving limited liability company and as a Wholly
Owned Subsidiary of Parent and shall continue to be governed by the laws of
the State of Delaware (as such, the " _Surviving Company_ ").

 



 

 **Section 1.2.** ** ****_Closing_** **.** Unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.1, the closing of the
Combination (the " _Closing_ ") will take place on the date that is the later
of (i) the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to
applicable law) of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their terms,
cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or,
where permitted, waiver of those conditions as of the Closing) set forth in
Article VIII and (ii) the final day of the Marketing Period or such earlier
date as may be specified by Parent on no less than three Business Days prior
written notice to the Company, unless another time or date is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Closing take place prior to October 4, 2014 (the date of the Closing, the "
_Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Willkie Farr and
Gallagher LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another
place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

 



 

 **Section 1.3.** ** ****_Effective Time_** **.** Subject to the provisions
of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall file a
certificate of merger relating to the Merger as contemplated by the DGCL and
the DLLCA (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the " _Secretary of State_ "), in such form as required by,
and executed in accordance with, the DGCL and the DLLCA. The Merger shall
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
the Secretary of State on the Closing Date, or at such other time as Parent
and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. As used
herein, the " _Effective Time_ " shall mean the time at which the Merger shall
become effective. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall file a certificate of merger relating to the
Subsequent Merger as contemplated by the DGCL and the

 



      
 

 



 

DLLCA (the " _Subsequent Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of
State, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the DGCL
and the DLLCA. The Subsequent Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Subsequent Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State
on the Closing Date or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and specify in the Subsequent Certificate of Merger. As used herein, the
" _Subsequent Effective Time_ " shall mean the time at which the Subsequent
Merger shall become effective.

 



 

 **Section 1.4.** ** ****_Effects of the Combination_** **.** At the
Effective Time, the effects of the Merger and, at the Subsequent Effective
Time, the effects of the Combination, shall be as provided in this Agreement,
the Certificate of Merger, the Subsequent Certificate of Merger, and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, (i) at the Effective Time,
all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub 1 shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub 1 shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) at the
Subsequent Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Surviving Corporation and Merger Sub 2 shall vest in the
Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation and Merger Sub 2 shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Company.

 



 

 **Section 1.5.** ** ****_Surviving Company Constituent Documents_**.

 



 

(a) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed
or amended as provided therein or by applicable law, except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of
Merger Sub 2, as in effect immediately prior to the Subsequent Effective Time,
shall be the certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement,
respectively, of the Surviving Company, until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable law, except as otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement and except that Article I of the certificate of formation of
the Surviving Company shall be amended to provide that "The name of the
limited liability company is tw telecom, llc".

 



 

 **Section 1.6.** ** ****_Surviving Company Managers and Officers_**.

 



 

From and after the Subsequent Effective Time, the managers of Merger Sub 2 in
office immediately prior to the Subsequent Effective Time shall be the initial
managers of the Surviving Company and the officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Subsequent Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Company and, in each case, shall hold office from the Subsequent
Effective Time until his or her respective successor is duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of formation and limited liability
company agreement of the Surviving Company or otherwise as provided by
applicable law.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 1.7.** ** ****_Capital Stock_**.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof:

 



 

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock (excluding any share underlying any
unvested portion of any Company Restricted Stock Award) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares),
shall be converted into (A) 0.70 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock, subject to Section 2.5 with
respect to fractional shares, (the " _Stock Consideration_ ") and (B) the
right to receive $10.00 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, together
with the Stock Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 



 

(ii) All shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares referred to in
Section 1.7(c)) shall cease to be issued and outstanding and shall be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a valid certificate
or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") or evidenced by way of book-
entry in the register of stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time (" _Uncertificated Company Stock_ ") shall thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except
the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends or
other distributions to which holders become entitled all in accordance with
Article II.

 



 

(iii) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub 1
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) At the Subsequent Effective Time, all limited liability company interests
of Merger Sub 2 issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Subsequent
Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist. At the
Subsequent Effective Time, each share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Subsequent Effective Time
shall be converted into one limited liability company interest of the
Surviving Company.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are owned by stockholders that have properly perfected
their rights of appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "

Merger Consideration, unless and until such stockholders shall have failed to
perfect any available right of appraisal under applicable law, but, instead,
the holders thereof shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or

Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served or delivered in connection with such demands
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (B) the opportunity and
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands made pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, (x) make any payment with

applicable, or otherwise change the Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock into any other securities, or make any other such stock dividend or
distribution in capital stock of Parent or the Company in respect of the
Parent Common Stock or the Company Common Stock, respectively, then any number
or amount contained herein which is based upon the price of the Parent Common
Stock or the number or fraction of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such split, combination, dividend or other distribution or change.

such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate
or other documentation (including an indemnity in customary form) reasonably
requested by Parent, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such

regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by
the Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and

 **Section 4.21.** ** ****_No Brokers_**. The Company will not be liable for
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission to any consultant, broker,
finder or investment banker in

arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2.

 



 

 **Section 4.22.** ** ****_Financing_** **. **As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct
copies of the fully executed Commitment Letter and the fully executed Fee
Letter executed in connection with the Financing (with only fee amounts, dates
and certain other economic terms, including in respect of the "market flex"
and "securities demand" provisions, redacted) (none of which would adversely
affect the amount or availability of the Financing other than through original
issue discount). As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and constitutes the legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors rights
generally and general principles of equity). As of the date hereof, the
Commitment Letter and Fee Letter have not been amended or modified in any
respect and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the commitments in the Commitment
Letter have not been withdrawn or terminated. There are no conditions
precedent to the funding of the full amount of the Financing on the terms set
forth in the Commitment Letter (as such terms may be altered in accordance
with the "market flex" provisions set forth in the Fee Letter executed in
connection with the Financing) other than as expressly set forth as of the
date hereof in the Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute
a breach by Parent or any other party thereto under the Commitment Letter.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter, as of the date
hereof, assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and
Section 8.2, the aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the agreements
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, together with other financial resources
of Parent, including its cash on hand and marketable securities, and cash on
hand of the Company, will, in the aggregate, be sufficient to fund the Cash
Consideration, the cash payable to holders of Company Equity Awards, pursuant
to Section 1.8, the payment of any debt required to be repaid, redeemed,
retired, canceled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in
connection with the Merger as of the date hereof (including all Indebtedness
of the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be repaid, redeemed, retired,
canceled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with
the Merger, including premiums and fees incurred in connection therewith (the
" _Required Indebtedness_ ")), and all other fees and expenses incurred by
Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. As of the date hereof, assuming
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2, Parent has no reason
to believe that either it or any other party will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis any condition of the Financing under the Commitment Letter or any
related Fee Letter or that the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter
will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. Assuming
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2, if the
Closing were to occur on the date hereof, the incurrence of the indebtedness
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, including the liens and guarantees
provided in connection therewith as set forth in the Commitment Letter, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, would not
result in a default or event of default under the Parent Existing Credit
Agreement, the Parent Existing Notes and the indentures governing the Parent
Existing Notes. There are no other letters, agreements or understandings
(other than customary non-disclosure agreements and diligence non-reliance
letters) between Parent, on the one hand, and the Financing Sources, on the
other hand, in connection with the Financing. Parent has fully paid all fees
and expenses and other amounts required to be paid on or prior to the date of
this Agreement pursuant

 



      
 

 



 

to the Commitment Letter.

 



 

 **Section 4.23.** ** ****_Network Operations_**.

 



 

(a) The network of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is in good
working condition and is without any material defects for purposes of
operating the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries as operated by Parent
and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries have good and valid title to or otherwise have
the right to use all items and equipment necessary to operate and maintain the

"moratorium", "control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover
statute or regulation or any anti-takeover provision in Parent Organizational
Documents is, or at the Effective Time will be, applicable to Parent, Parent
Common Stock, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 4.25.** ** ****_Board Approval_** **.** The Board of Directors of
Parent, at a meeting duly called and held, by unanimous vote (i) determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of,

consent of the holders of any class or series of Parents capital stock
necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger.

to the Knowledge of Parent, any of the Companys directors, officers,
employees, agents or other representatives acting on Parents behalf have,

(b) The United States government has not notified Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries of any actual or alleged violation or breach of the Fraud and
Bribery Laws. Other than the United States government, no Person has notified

of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries), shall be eligible to either, at the sole discretion of Parent:
(i) participate in Parents employee benefit plans and programs, including any
pension plan, defined benefit plan, defined contribution plan, bonus plan,
profit sharing plan, severance plan, medical plan, dental plan, life insurance
plan, time off programs and disability plan, in each case to the same extent
and on the same terms (for the avoidance of doubt, including with respect to
level of benefits) as similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries; or (ii) continue to participate in employee benefit plans,
programs and policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which provide
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the benefits provided
to such Continuing Company Employee under the Company Benefit Plans
immediately before the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Parent agrees that any Continuing Company Employee whose employment is
terminated by the Surviving Corporation without "cause" within the one (1)
year period commencing on the Effective Time, other than an employee who is
party to an individual employment agreement or other Contract or other Company
Benefit Plan which provides for the payment of severance, will be entitled to
cash severance benefits that are no less favorable, and welfare benefits that
are no less favorable in the aggregate, in each case than the cash severance
benefits and welfare benefits, respectively, if any, determined in accordance
with the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan providing for severance
benefits to such Continuing Company Employee in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, subject to such employee providing a timely and effective release
of claims in favor of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Affiliates to the extent not otherwise required.

 



 

(c) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan in which
any Continuing Company Employee first become eligible to participate on or
after the Effective Time (collectively, the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing
Company Employee shall, to the extent

 



      
 

 



 

permitted by applicable law, receive full credit for the years of continuous
service by such Continuing Company Employee recognized by the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time pursuant to a Company Benefit Plan to
the same extent as if it were service with Parent for all purposes other than
benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, where such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits or where such services were not recognized
under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan or no corresponding Company
Benefit Plan existed. With respect to any New Plan that is a welfare benefit
plan in which any Continuing Company Employees first become eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to, (i) cause to be waived any eligibility requirements or
pre-existing condition limitations except to the extent such eligibility
requirements or pre-existing conditions would apply under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan in which any such Continuing Company Employee was a
participant or eligible to participate as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductibles, co-
insurance or maximum out of pocket limitations, to amounts paid by such
Continuing Company Employees prior to the Effective Time under a Company
Benefit Plan in which any such Continuing Company Employee was a participant
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent that such
credit was given under such Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time)
in satisfying such requirements during the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs.

 



 

(d) Each of the Company and Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of
control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans
will, for purposes of the Company Benefit Plans only, occur at or prior to the
Effective Time, as applicable.

 



 

(e) If requested by Parent at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably
necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date, any defined contribution Company
Benefit Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to meet the
requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Company Defined Contribution
Plan_ "); provided, however, that the effectiveness of such termination may be
conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. If the Company is required to
terminate any Company Defined Contribution Plan, then the Company shall
provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption
by the Board of Directors of the Company of resolutions authorizing the
termination of such Company Defined Contribution Plan (the form and substance
of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and approval of
Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the
event that Parent requests that the Company Defined Contribution Plan be
terminated in accordance with this Section 6.2(e), Parent shall, or shall
cause one of its Affiliates to, designate a tax-qualified defined contribution
plan of Parent or one of its Affiliates (the " _Parent Defined Contribution
Plan_ ") that either (i) currently allows for the receipt from participants in
the Company Defined Contribution Plan of "eligible rollover distributions" (as
such term is defined under Section 402 of the Code), including loans, or (ii)
shall be amended prior to the Effective Time to allow for the receipt from
such participants of eligible rollover distributions, including loans. In the
event that Parent requests that the Company Defined Contribution Plan be
terminated in accordance with this Section 6.2(e), each participant in the
Company Defined Contribution Plan shall immediately as of the Closing Date be
eligible to commence participation in the Parent Defined Contribution Plan and
be given the opportunity to receive a distribution of his or her account
balance under the Company Defined Contribution Plan,

 



      
 

 



 

and shall be given the opportunity to elect to "roll over" such account
balance (including any outstanding loan) to the Parent Defined Contribution
Plan.

 



 

(f) Parent and the Company agree to the additional provisions set forth in
Schedule 6.2(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(g) Prior to making any broad-based communication or written communications
that would reasonably be interpreted to create a legally binding right to any
future compensation on the part of a Continuing Employee, in each case,
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any schedules hereto),
the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication,
Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any
such mutually agreeable communication.

 



 

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 or any other provision of this
Agreement, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or
modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, including without
limitation, any Company Benefit Plan or any Parent Benefit Plan, (ii) shall
alter or limit the ability of any of Parent, the Surviving Company, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them, (iii) is intended to confer upon any current or
former employee any right to employment or continued employment for any period
of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or
condition of employment, or (iv) is intended to confer upon any Person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former employee,
director, officer or other service provider or any participant in a Company
Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement)
any right as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 6.3.** ** ****_Indemnification Continuation_**.

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Section 6.3, (i) "Indemnified Person" shall mean any
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, (x) an
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (y) serving
at the request of the Company as an officer or director of another
corporation, joint venture or other enterprise or general partner of any
partnership or a trustee of any trust, and (ii) "Proceeding" shall mean any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to
provide indemnification to each Indemnified Person in connection with any
Proceeding based directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) on, or arising
directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) out of, the fact that such
Indemnified Person is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as an
officer or director of another corporation, joint venture or other enterprise
or general partner of any partnership or a trustee of any trust, whether
pertaining to any matter arising before or after the Effective Time. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, each Indemnified Person
will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
such claim, action, suit or proceeding from Parent or the Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Company within a reasonable period of time following receipt by Parent or the
Surviving Company from the Indemnified Person of a request therefor; provided
that an Indemnified Person shall repay Parent or the Surviving Company for any
expenses incurred by Parent or Surviving Company in connection with the
indemnification of such Indemnified Person pursuant to this Section 6.3 if it
is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person did not meet the
standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by Parent or the Surviving
Company as set forth in the Company Organizational Documents. The Surviving
Company (i) shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and
any of its Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and by-laws or similar
organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
individuals who at the Effective Time were directors, officers or employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) shall comply with and shall
not amend without the consent of the other parties thereto, any
indemnification contracts of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their
respective current or former directors, officers or employees as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that Parent consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.3, unless such assumption occurs by operation of law.

 



 

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, and the Surviving Company
shall, maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance policies covering acts or
omissions occurring (or alleged to occur) prior to or at the Effective Time
with respect to Indemnified Persons; provided, however, that in no event shall
the Surviving Company be required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.3(c)
more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by
the Company for such insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Company would be required to
expend more than 300% of current annual premiums, the Surviving Company shall
obtain the maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by payment of annual
premiums equal to 300% of current annual premiums. In lieu of the foregoing,
the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year "tail"
prepaid officers and directors liability insurance policy in respect of acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such
Indemnified Person. If such "tail" policy has been established by the Company,
Parent shall not terminate such policy and shall cause all obligations of the
Company thereunder to be honored by it and the Surviving Company.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.3 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger for a period of six years and are expressly intended to benefit each of
the Indemnified Persons; provided, however, that in the event that any claim
or claims for indemnification are asserted or made within such six-year
period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims
shall continue until disposition of any and all such claims.

 



 

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, pay all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided
in this Section 6.3 to the same extent and under the same conditions and
procedures (and subject to the same conditions, including with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to the advancement of expenses) as such Indemnified Person is entitled
on the date hereof under the Company Organizational Documents (or the
corresponding organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company).

 



 

 **Section 6.4.** ** ****_Notice of Breach_** **.** From and after the date
hereof and until the earlier to occur of the Closing Date or the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX hereof, Parent shall promptly give
written notice with particularity upon having Knowledge of (i) any matter that
would constitute a material breach of any representation, warranty, agreement
or covenant of Parent contained in this Agreement or (ii) the existence of any
event or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to cause any condition
to the obligations of any party hereto to effect the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement not to be satisfied or that would reasonably be expected to
cause the Financing not to occur; provided, however that a failure to give
notice pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be excluded for purposes of the
condition set forth in Section 8.3.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII.**

 



 

 **ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES**

 



 

 **Section 7.1.** ** ****_Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
Registration Statement; Stockholder Meetings_**.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within 40 days after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate in
preparing and cause to be filed with the SEC the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and Parent shall prepare, together with the Company, and
file with the SEC the registration statement on Form S-4 or any amendment or
supplement thereto pursuant to which shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in
the Merger will be registered with the SEC (the " _Registration Statement_ ")
(in which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included). Parent and
the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to become effective under the Securities Act as soon after such
filing as practicable and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long
as is necessary to consummate the Merger. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
shall include the recommendation of each of the Boards of Directors of the
Company and Parent in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Combination, and any resolution required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange
Act to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation required to be
disclosed in the Registration Statement pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation
S-K, except to the extent the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
withdrawn or modified its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the
Combination to the extent such action is permitted by Section 7.4, and, with
respect to the Board of Directors of Parent, in favor of approval and adoption
of the Parent Share Issuance and the Parent Charter Amendment. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its respective stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement becomes effective.
The parties shall promptly provide copies, consult with each other and prepare
written responses with respect to any written comments received from the SEC
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration
Statement and advise one another of any oral comments received from the SEC.
The Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall, at
the time of each of the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, comply as to form in all material respects with the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act

 



      
 

 



 

and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to
the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby under the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and applicable "blue sky" laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Each party will advise the other, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance
of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. No
amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement shall be filed without the approval of both parties
hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided that with respect to documents filed by a party which are
incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement, this right of approval shall apply only with respect
to information relating to the other party or such other partys business,
financial condition or results of operations. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that
such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company and Parent.

 



 

(c) The Company shall cause the Company Stockholders Meeting to be duly called
and held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the
Required Company Vote. In connection with such meeting, the Company will (i)
subject to Section 7.4(b) and Section 7.4(c), use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Required Company Vote and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal
requirements applicable to such meeting. The information supplied or to be
supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation in the
Registration Statement shall not at the time the Registration Statement is
declared effective by the SEC contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein not misleading. The information
supplied or to be supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion in the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which shall be included in the Registration
Statement, shall not, on the date(s) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is
first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and the stockholders of
Parent, respectively, or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting or
the Parent Stockholders Meeting, respectively, or at the Effective Time,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on a date for which the
Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to
obtain the Required Company Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, the
Company shall have the right on one or more occasions to

 



      
 

 



 

postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting for not more than an
aggregate of forty (40) days, solely for the purpose of soliciting shares of
Company Common Stock to obtain the Required Company Vote.

 



 

(d) Parent shall cause the Parent Stockholders Meeting to be duly called and
held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the
Required Parent Vote. In connection with such meeting, Parent will (i) subject
to Section 7.4(h), use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required
Parent Vote and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable
to such meeting. The information supplied or to be supplied by Parent
specifically for inclusion or incorporation in the Registration Statement
shall not at the time the Registration Statement is declared effective by the
SEC contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading. The information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent specifically for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
which shall be included in the Registration Statement, shall not, on the
date(s) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company and the stockholders of Parent, respectively, or
at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders
Meeting, respectively, or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if on a date for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is
scheduled, Parent has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to obtain the Required Parent Vote, whether or
not a quorum is present, Parent shall have the right on one or more occasions
to postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting for not more than an
aggregate of forty (40) days, solely for the purpose of soliciting shares of
Parent Common Stock to obtain the Required Parent Vote. Parent shall cause the
Parent Charter Amendment to be duly filed with the Secretary of the State of
Delaware such that it is effective no later than the Closing Date, immediately
prior to Closing.

 



 

 **Section 7.2.** ** ****_Access to Information_**.

 



 

Upon reasonable notice, each of Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause
its respective Subsidiaries to) afford to the other party hereto and its
representatives (including Financing Sources and their representatives)
reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all its officers, employees, properties, offices, plants
and other facilities and to all books and records, including financial
statements, other financial data and monthly financial statements within the
time such statements are customarily prepared, and, during such period, each
of Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries
to) furnish promptly to the other party hereto and its representatives
(including Financing Sources and their representatives), consistent with its
legal obligations, all other information concerning its business, properties
and personnel as such Person may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that either party hereto may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that,
in such Persons reasonable judgment, (i) providing such access would result
in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege, in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if such Person shall have used all reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of such third party to such access, or (ii) any law,
treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to such
Person requires such Person or its Subsidiaries to

 



      
 

 



 

preclude the other party and its representatives from gaining access to any
properties or information. Each party hereto will hold any such information
that is non-public in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance
with, the provisions of that certain agreement, dated May 22, 2014 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between the Company and Parent.

 



 

 **Section 7.3.** ** ****_Efforts_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the
date hereof, including, without limitation, (i) preparing and filing, in
consultation with the other party and as promptly as practicable and advisable
after the date hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary applications,
notices, petitions, filings, and other documents and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all waiting period expirations or terminations, consents,
clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) taking all steps as
may be necessary to obtain all such waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits,
authorizations, orders and approvals; provided, however, that efforts in
connection with the Financing and the Required Indebtedness shall be governed
by Section 7.12 and not this Section 7.3. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees (i) to make an appropriate filing
of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within 15 Business Days after the execution of this Agreement, and to supply
as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable, (ii) to file all
applications required to be filed with the FCC within 30 calendar days after
the execution of this Agreement; and (iii) to file all notices and
applications with PUCs within 15 Business Days after the execution of this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 7.3(a) to obtain all waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations,
approvals, permits, and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under the HSR Act, the Communications Act or any other
Regulatory Law (as defined below), (i) cooperate in all respects and consult
with each other in connection with any communication, filing or submission and
in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party, including by allowing the other party
and/or its counsel to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and
comment on drafts of any communications, filings and submissions (and
documents submitted therewith); (ii) promptly inform the other party of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the FCC, any other Governmental Entity or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person,
including by promptly providing copies to the other party of any such written
communications, and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each

 



      
 

 



 

case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(iii) permit the other party to review any communication it gives to, and
consult with each other in advance of any meeting substantive telephone call,
or conference with the DOJ, the FTC, FCC, or such other Governmental Entity or
other person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC, the FCC, or any
other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other party
and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings,
substantive telephone calls and conferences, provided, however, that materials
may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent,
the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, (y) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address reasonable privilege
or confidentiality concerns. Parent and the Company may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material to be provided to the other under this Section 7.3(b) as "Antitrust
Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in obtained in advance from
the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its
legal counsel. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, the Communications Act, and all other
national, federal or state, domestic or foreign, if any, statutes, rules,
regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other
laws that are designed or intended to (i) prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or affecting competition or market conditions through merger, acquisition or
other transaction or (ii) regulate telecommunications businesses. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in
Section 7.3(a) and this Section 7.3(b), each party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Regulatory Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent shall not be required to (and without the consent of the
Company shall not) agree to any terms, conditions or modifications (including
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries having to cease
operating, sell or otherwise dispose of any assets or business (including the
requirement that any such assets or businesses be held separate)) with respect
to obtaining the expiration or termination of any waiting period or any
consents, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders in connection
with the Combination or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that would result in, or would be reasonably likely to result
in, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the
Combination (assuming Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after to
giving effect to the Combination, are the size of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, prior to giving effect to the Combination) (a
" _Specified Material Adverse Effect_ "); _provided_ , _however,_ that nothing
contained in this Agreement shall require Company to agree to, or take, any
action in connection with Section 7.3 of this Agreement unless such agreement
or action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated herein.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the expiration or termination of all waiting periods and all consents,
waivers, authorizations and approvals of all third parties, including
Governmental Entities (except those contemplated by Section 7.3(b), which
shall be governed by that Section), necessary, proper or advisable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to provide
any notices to

 



      
 

 



 

third parties required to be provided prior to the Effective Time; provided
that, without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not incur
any significant expense or liability, enter into any significant new
commitment or agreement or agree to any significant modification to any
contractual arrangement to obtain such consents or certificates in each case,
that would have a material adverse effect on the business or operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

 **Section 7.4.** ** ****_Acquisition Proposals_**.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Section 7.4, none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall (whether directly or indirectly
through Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives, advisors
or other intermediaries), nor shall (directly or indirectly) the Company
authorize or permit any of its or their controlled Affiliates, officers,
directors, representatives, advisors or other intermediaries or Subsidiaries
to: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of inquiries,
proposals or offers from any Person (other than Parent) relating to any
Company Acquisition Proposal, or agree to or endorse any Company Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) enter into any agreement to (x) consummate any Company
Acquisition Proposal, (y) approve or endorse any Company Acquisition Proposal
or (z) in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal, require it to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Combination; (iii) enter into or
participate in any discussions or negotiations in connection with any Company
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry with respect to any Company Acquisition
Proposal, or furnish to any Person any non-public information with respect to
its business, properties or assets in connection with any Company Acquisition
Proposal; or (iv) agree to resolve to take, or take, any of the actions
prohibited by clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this sentence. The Company shall
immediately cease, and cause its representatives, advisors and other

Closing pursuant to the terms hereof, draw a sufficient amount of the
Financing or Alternative Financing to enable Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger
Sub 2 to consummate the Merger; it being understood that the receipt of the

conditions set forth herein (subject to the terms and conditions of Section
9.1 and Section 9.2); and (v) enforce the counterparties obligations and
Parents rights under the Commitment Letter in the event of a breach or
repudiation by any party thereto that would reasonably be expected to
materially impede or delay the Closing.

 



 

(b) Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 to,
agree to or permit any amendment, replacements, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights or remedies under, the Commitment
Letter or Fee Letter without the Companys prior written consent; provided
that Parent may (x) enter into any amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification to or waiver of any provision of the Commitment Letter or Fee

Letter and Fee Letter as in effect on the date hereof, (ii) adversely affect
the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Commitment Letter and Fee Letter as in effect on the date hereof or in any
definitive agreements executed in connection herewith, (iii) reduce the

this Agreement so long as any such addition would not reasonably be expected
to prevent, materially hinder or materially delay the consummation of the
Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
availability of the Financing under the Commitment Letter. Parent shall
promptly deliver to the Company copies (redacted only as to fee amounts, dates
and certain other economic terms, including in respect of the "market flex"
and "securities demand" provisions, in the case of the Fee Letter) of any such
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification or waiver of the
Commitment Letter or Fee Letter.

 



 

(c) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions described in or contemplated by the Commitment Letter
(including after giving

 



      
 

 



 

effect to the "market flex" provisions set forth in the Fee Letter executed in
connection with the Financing) for any reason, Parent shall, in consultation
with the Company, use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative
financing from the same or alternative sources (the " _Alternative Financing_
") in an amount sufficient (together with cash on hand of the Company) to fund
the Cash Consideration, the cash payable to holders of Company Equity Awards
pursuant to Section 1.8, the Required Indebtedness and all other fees and
expenses incurred by Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and the Company in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and

prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the
Financing or Alternative Financing or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any conditions to the closing of such Financing or
Alternative Financing that are materially less favorable to Parent than the
conditions to closing in the Commitment Letter (as defined immediately prior
to such Alternative Financing). If an Alternative Financing is required in
accordance with this Section 7.12(c), Parent shall obtain, and when obtained,
provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides
for such Alternative Financing, and Parent shall comply with its covenants in
Section 7.12(a) and Section 7.12(b) with respect to the Commitment Letter (as
defined immediately after receipt of such Alternative Financing).

 



 

(d) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice of any material breach
or repudiation by any party of the Commitment Letter or Fee Letter of which
Parent becomes aware or any termination of the Commitment Letter or Fee
Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange and consummate
the Financing.

commence an offer to purchase with respect to any and all of the outstanding
aggregate principal amount of the Companys Notes for cash on price terms that
are determined by Parent and in compliance with applicable law (including SEC
rules and regulations) and the provisions of the indentures governing the
applicable series of Notes to be consummated substantially simultaneously with
the Closing and no earlier than the Effective Time using funds provided by
Parent (the " _Offers to Purchase_ "), and (ii) solicit the consent of the
holders of each series of Notes, regarding certain proposed amendments to the
indenture governing such series of Notes (the " _Indenture Amendments_ ") as
determined by Parent and in compliance with applicable law (including SEC
rules and regulations) and the provisions of the indentures governing the
applicable series of Notes and as set forth in the tender offer and consent
solicitation documents sent to holders of such series of Notes to become
effective substantially simultaneously with the Closing and no earlier than
the Effective Time, which amendments may include the elimination of all or
substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain other provisions
contained in the indenture governing such series of Notes that can be
eliminated upon the favorable vote of the holders of a majority of the
principal amount thereof (the " _Consent Solicitations_ " and, together with
the Offers to Purchase, the " _Debt Tender Offer_ "); provided, in each case,
that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article
IX. Any documentation relating to the Debt Tender Offer (including all
amendments or supplements thereto) (the "Offer Documents") and all material
requested to be published or mailed to the holders of the Notes in connection
with any Debt Tender Offer shall be subject to the prior review of, and
comment (which review shall be made as promptly as reasonably practical) of
the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Company; provided that, in

 



      
 

 



 

any event, Parent and the Company hereby agree that (i) the terms and
conditions of the Debt Tender Offer shall provide that the closing thereof
shall be contingent upon the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time;
(ii) the Indenture Amendments shall not require the consent of the holders of
more than a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the applicable
series of Notes in the aggregate, and (iii) promptly upon expiration of the
Consent Solicitations, assuming the requisite consents have been received with
respect to such series of Notes, the Company shall execute a supplemental
indenture to the indentures governing each series of Notes that will not
become operative prior to the Effective Time and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the trustee under each such indenture to enter into such
supplemental indenture prior to or substantially simultaneously with the
Closing. Concurrent with the Effective Time, and in accordance with the terms
of the Debt Tender Offer, the Surviving Company shall accept for purchase and
purchase each series of Notes properly tendered and not properly withdrawn in
the Debt Tender Offer using funds provided by or at the direction of Parent.
Parent hereby covenants and agrees to, promptly following the Effective Time,
directly or indirectly pay for the Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn
to the extent required pursuant to the terms of the Debt Tender Offer. Any
Indenture Amendments contemplated by the Debt Tender Offer shall revert to the
form in effect prior to the effectiveness of any Indenture Amendments and be
of no further effect if the Closing does not occur.

 



 

(f) If at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Tender Offer any
information should be discovered by the Company or by Parent that the Company
or Parent reasonably believes should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by
Parent describing such information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of
the Company to the holders of the applicable Notes. The parties shall comply
with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, to the extent
applicable, and any other applicable laws in connection with the Debt Tender
Offer.

 



 

(g) Parent shall pay the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any dealer
manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection
with the Debt Tender Offer. At Parents expense, the Company shall provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary or reasonably
required in connection with the Debt Tender Offer, including, without
limitation, executing supplemental indentures to the indentures governing each
series of Notes that will become operative only immediately upon the Effective
Time, using reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee under each such
indenture to enter such supplemental indenture prior or substantially
simultaneously with the Closing, and providing the information necessary to
distribute the applicable Offer Documents to the holders of the applicable
series of Notes. The Company shall not be required to deliver or to cause its
counsel to deliver any legal opinions in connection with the Debt Tender Offer
or the execution by the trustee under any indenture of any supplemental
indentures required in connection with the consummation thereof.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.12,
the Company shall not be required to take any action in connection with the
Debt Tender Offer that it believes, after consultation with counsel, (i) could
reasonably be expected to cause the Company

 



       
 

 



 

to violate (A) federal or state securities laws or (B) the provisions of the
indentures governing the applicable series of Notes or (ii) would reasonably
be expected to cause the Company to materially violate the provisions of any
other material contract of the Company and its Subsidiaries. It is expressly
agreed by the parties hereto that the failure to obtain the consent of the
holders of the Notes in connection with any Debt Offer shall not be deemed to
be a breach by the Company under this Agreement or a failure of any condition
hereto.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent, Merger Sub 1
and Merger Sub 2, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the respective officers, employees, agents
and representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent,
Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent
that is necessary or reasonably required in connection with the Financing,
including the following: (i) using reasonable best efforts to make the
Companys and its Subsidiaries senior management and other representatives

investors and prospective lenders on reasonable advance notice; (ii) assisting
with the preparation of appropriate and customary materials for rating agency
presentations, offering and syndication documents, bank information memoranda,
business projections, other marketing documentation and similar documents
reasonably required in connection with the Financing (and executing customary
representation letters in connection therewith); provided, that any such
marketing materials shall reflect that one or more of Parent and its
Subsidiaries will be the obligors at Closing and that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall have no obligations thereunder unless and until the
Effective Time occurs; (iii) executing and delivering definitive financing
documents, (and assisting in the preparation of applicable schedules and other
information necessary in connection therewith) including any pledge and
security documents, any loan agreements, currency or interest hedging
agreements, certificates, and other definitive financing documents usual and
customary for transactions of the type contemplated by the Commitment Letter
on terms reasonably requested by Parent, provided that no obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such document or agreement shall
be effective until the Effective Time; (iv) using reasonable best efforts to
facilitate the pledging of collateral (including cooperation in connection
with the pay-off of existing Indebtedness to the extent contemplated by this
Agreement and the release of related Liens and terminations of security
interests), provided that no pledge or pay-off of existing Indebtedness shall
be effective or required, as the case may be, until the Effective Time; (v)
using reasonable best efforts to furnish, on a confidential basis (other than
the financial statements required by clause (vii) below), to Parent, Merger
Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 and the Financing Sources, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company
as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Financing,
including all financial statements and other financial data regarding the
Company reasonably required by the Commitment Letter (but excluding pro forma
financial information); (vi) executing and delivering (or using reasonable
best efforts to obtain from its advisors), and causing its Subsidiaries to
execute and deliver (or use reasonable best efforts to obtain from its
advisors), customary certificates, accounting comfort letters (including
consents of accountants for use of their audit reports in any financial
statements relating to the Financing) or other documents and instruments
relating to guarantees and other matters ancillary to the Financing as may be
reasonably requested by Parent as necessary and customary in connection with
the Financing, (vii) providing audited consolidated financial statements of
the Company covering the three (3) fiscal

 



      
 

 



 

years immediately preceding the Closing for which audited consolidated
financial statements are required to have been filed pursuant to the Exchange
Act, and unaudited financial statements (excluding footnotes) for any regular
quarterly interim fiscal period or periods of the Company ended after the date
of the most recent audited financial statements and at least 45 days prior to
the Closing Date (the information required to be delivered pursuant to this
clause (vii) being referred to as the " _Required Financial Information_ "),
(viii) requesting that its independent accountants cooperate with and assist
Parent in preparing customary and appropriate information packages and
offering materials as the parties to the Commitment Letter may reasonably
request for use in connection with the offering and/or syndication of debt
securities, (ix) using reasonable best efforts to assist in obtaining third
party consents in connection with the Financing, and in extinguishing Existing
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and releasing liens securing

furnishing all documentation and other information required by Governmental
Entities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001, but in each case,
solely as relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2, and (xi)
taking such other customary actions as are reasonably requested by Parent or
the Financing Sources to facilitate the satisfaction of all conditions
precedent to obtaining the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letter to the
extent within the control of the Company (including delivery of the stock and
other equity certificates of the Companys Subsidiaries to Parent); provided
that nothing herein shall require until the Effective Time occurs, either the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (A) pay any fees, expenses or other
amounts in connection with the Financing, (B) have any liability or obligation
under any loan agreement or any related document or any other agreement or
document related to the Financing, (C) incur any liability in connection with
the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter, (D) enter into any
definitive agreement or commitment that would be effective prior to the
Effective Time (other than customary management representation letters), (E)
provide any such cooperation to the extent that it would interfere materially
and unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (F) deliver (x) any financial information in a form not
customarily prepared by the Company or its Subsidiaries or (y) any financial
information with respect to a fiscal period that has not yet ended or (G) take
any action that would conflict with or violate the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries organizational documents or any applicable laws. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Board of Directors of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries, in each case as constituted prior to the Effective Time, shall
not be required to adopt any resolutions or take any other action in
connection with the authorization of any of the Financing other than to
approve regulatory filings relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection therewith.

 



 

(j) All material non-public information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries provided to Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and their
respective representatives pursuant to this Section 7.12 shall be kept
confidential by them in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. The
Company hereby consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in
a manner that is not intended to nor is reasonably likely to harm or disparage
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets, including their
logos and marks.

 



 

(k) Parent shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the

 



      
 

 



 

Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including without limitation professional fees and expenses of accountants,
legal counsel and other advisors) to the extent such costs are incurred by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with cooperation provided by the
Company, its Subsidiaries, their respective officers, employees and other
representatives pursuant to the terms of Section 7.12 (including in connection
with the Financing and/or the Debt Tender Offer), or in connection with
compliance with its obligations under Section 7.12, and Parent hereby agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the
"Financing Indemnitees") from and against any and all liabilities, damages,
claims, costs, expenses or losses suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the Financing and Debt Tender Offers, any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than arising from information provided in writing
by the Company or its Subsidiaries) and any misuse of the logos or marks of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, except to the extent that such liabilities,
damages, claims, costs, expenses or losses arose out of or result from the
willful misconduct of a Financing Indemnitee (the obligations in this
sentence, the " _Financing Cooperation Indemnity_ "). The obligations of
Parent in the foregoing sentence shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and any termination of this Agreement. After the Effective Time, the Financing
Cooperation Indemnity only may be amended or waived in respect of any
Financing Indemnitee with the consent of such Financing Indemnitee.
