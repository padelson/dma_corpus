the extent  consistent  with its Articles of  Incorporation,  possess all of the
rights, privileges,  immunities and franchises, of a public as well as a private

personal and mixed, and all debts due on whatever account,  and all other choses
in action,  and each and every other  interest of or belonging to or due to each
of the Constituent  Corporations  shall be taken and deemed to be transferred to
and vested in the Surviving  Corporation  without  further act or deed;  and the
title to any real  estate  or any  interest  therein  vested  in  either  of the
Constituent Corporations shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of
the Merger.  The Surviving  Corporation shall thenceforth be responsible for all
the   liabilities,   obligations  and  penalties  of  each  of  the  Constituent
Corporations;  and any claim, existing action or proceeding,  civil or criminal,
pending by or against either of the Constituent  Corporations  may be prosecuted
as if the  Merger  had not taken  place,  or the  Surviving  Corporation  may be
substituted  in its  place;  and any  judgment  rendered  against  either of the
Constituent  Corporations  may be enforced  against the  Surviving  Corporation.
Neither the rights of creditors nor any liens upon the property of either of the
Constituent Corporations shall be impaired by reason of the Merger.

consider or be advised that any further deeds,  assignments or assurances in law
or any other  actions are  necessary,  desirable  or proper to vest,  perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise,  in the Surviving Corporation,  the title to any
property or rights of the Constituent Corporations acquired or to be acquired by
reason of, or as a result of, the Merger,  the  Constituent  Corporations  agree
that such Constituent Corporations and their proper officers and directors shall
and will execute and deliver all such proper deeds,  assignments  and assurances
in law and do all  things  necessary,  desirable  or proper to vest,  perfect or
confirm  title to such  property  or rights  in the  Surviving  Corporation  and
otherwise  to carry  out the  purpose  of this  Agreement,  and that the  proper
officers and directors of the Surviving  Corporation  are fully  authorized  and
directed in the name of the  Constituent  Corporations  or otherwise to take any
and all such actions.

2.7     Merger Consideration
        --------------------

     (a) As  used  herein,  the  term  "Merger  Consideration"  shall  mean  the
consideration  described in (i), (ii) or (iii) below,  as elected as provided in
Section 2.8(d) by each  FloridaFirst  shareholder (the "Electing  Shareholder"),
and subject to adjustment as provided in paragraphs  (b) and (c) of this Section
2.7:

     (i) .66 (the "Exchange  Ratio") shares of BB&T Common Stock (to the nearest
ten thousandth of a share) to be exchanged for each share of FloridaFirst Common
Stock owned by the Electing  Shareholder  as of the  Effective  Time (the "Stock
Election"); or

     (ii) .363 shares of BB&T Common Stock (to the nearest ten  thousandth  of a
share) and $11.25 in cash to be exchanged for each share of FloridaFirst  Common
Stock  owned  by  the  Electing  Shareholder  as  of  the  Effective  Time  (the
"Cash/Stock Election"); or

     (iii) $25.00 in cash for each share of  FloridaFirst  Common Stock owned by
the Electing Shareholder as of the Effective Time (the "Cash Election")

     (b)  Notwithstanding  paragraph  (a)  preceding,  in  no  event  shall  the
aggregate   amount  of  cash  Merger   Consideration   payable  to  FloridaFirst
shareholders  choosing the Cash/Stock  Election and the Cash Election exceed the
product  of $11.25  multiplied  by the number of shares of  FloridaFirst  Common
Stock  outstanding  at the close of  business  on the  Closing  Date (the  "Cash
Amount").  In the  event  that  the  amount  of  cash  payable  pursuant  to the
Cash/Stock  Election and the Cash  Election  (without  adjustment as provided in
this paragraph (b), herein the  "Unadjusted  Cash Amount") would exceed the Cash
Amount (the "Excess Cash Amount"), the Merger Consideration with respect to each
share  of  FloridaFirst  Common  Stock  subject  to the Cash  Election  shall be
adjusted as follows:  (i) by  decreasing  the cash amount which would be payable
with respect to each such share pursuant to the Cash Election  (determined  with
reference to the  Unadjusted  Cash Amount) by the amount  determined by dividing
the  Excess  Cash  Amount  by the  number of such  shares;  and (ii) by adding a
fractional  share of BB&T Common Stock  determined by  multiplying  the Exchange
Ratio by a fraction,  the numerator of which is the Excess Cash Amount per share
and the denominator of which is $25.00.

     (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Cash Amount exceed
55% of the value of the aggregate  Merger  Consideration,  determined by valuing
shares of BB&T Common Stock at Closing Value (the "Consideration Value"). In the
event that the Cash Amount would exceed 55% of the  Consideration  Value, and if
BB&T and  FloridaFirst  are unable to  negotiate a mutually  acceptable  revised
pricing formula,  either of BB&T or FloridaFirst may terminate this Agreement by
providing notice to the other.

                                       10

<PAGE>


     (d) Cash (without  interest) will be payable in exchange for any fractional
share  of  BB&T  Common  Stock  which  would  otherwise  be  distributable  to a
FloridaFirst  shareholder.  The  amount  of cash  payable  with  respect  to any
fractional  share of BB&T Common Stock shall be  determined by  multiplying  the
fractional  part of such share by the Closing Value.  The "Closing  Value" shall
mean the average 4:00 p.m.  eastern time closing  price per share of BB&T Common
Stock  on the  NYSE as  reported  on  NYSEnet.com  for  the  five  trading  days
(determined by excluding days on which the NYSE is closed) ending on the trading
day preceding the Closing Date.

2.8     Conversion of Shares; Payment of Merger Consideration
        -----------------------------------------------------

     (a) At the  Effective  Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of  FloridaFirst  or the  holders of record of  FloridaFirst  Common
Stock,   each  share  of  FloridaFirst   Common  Stock  issued  and  outstanding
immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time  shall be  converted  into and  shall
represent the right to receive,  upon surrender of the certificate  representing
such share of  FloridaFirst  Common Stock (as provided in subsection (d) below),
the Merger Consideration.

     (b) Each share of BB&T  Common  Stock  issued and  outstanding  immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be issued and outstanding.

     (c) Until  surrendered,  each  outstanding  certificate  which prior to the
Effective Time represented one or more shares of FloridaFirst Common Stock shall
be deemed upon the Effective  Time for all purposes to represent  only the right
to receive the Merger  Consideration  and any declared and unpaid dividends with
respect to FloridaFirst Common Stock. No interest will be paid or accrued on the
Merger  Consideration  upon the  surrender of the  certificate  or  certificates
representing   shares  of  FloridaFirst   Common  Stock.  With  respect  to  any
certificate for FloridaFirst Common Stock that has been lost or destroyed,  BB&T
shall pay the Merger Consideration attributable to such certificate upon receipt
of a surety bond or other  adequate  indemnity  as required in  accordance  with
BB&T's  standard  policy,  and  evidence  reasonably  satisfactory  to  BB&T  of
ownership  of  the  shares  represented  thereby.   After  the  Effective  Time,
FloridaFirst's  transfer  books shall be closed and no transfer of the shares of
FloridaFirst  Common Stock  outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation.

     (d) Promptly after the Effective  Time, BB&T shall cause to be delivered or
mailed to each  FloridaFirst  shareholder  a form of letter of  transmittal  and
instructions for electing the form of Merger Consideration in Section 2.7(a)(i),
(ii) or (iii),  and for  effecting  the  surrender  of the  certificates  which,
immediately prior to the Effective Time,  represented any shares of FloridaFirst
Common Stock.  Upon proper  surrender of such  certificates or other evidence of
ownership meeting the requirements of Section 2.8(c),  together with such letter
of transmittal  duly executed and completed in accordance with the  instructions
thereto,  and such other  documents as may be reasonably  requested,  BB&T shall
promptly  cause the  transfer  to the  persons  entitled  thereto  of the Merger

                                       11

<PAGE>

Consideration  in  the  form  elected.   An  election  of  the  form  of  Merger
Consideration  shall be final and irrevocable when received by BB&T. If, for any
reason,  BB&T does not receive a properly  filed  election of the form of Merger
Consideration  in Section  2.7(a)(i),  (ii) or (iii) from any person entitled to
the Merger Consideration by 5:00 p.m.,  Winston-Salem,  North Carolina,  time on
the  thirtieth  day  following  the  mailing  of the letter of  transmittal  and
instructions,  such person shall be deemed to have made the Cash/Stock  Election
in Section 2.7(a)(ii) for all purposes herein.

     (e)  The   Surviving   Corporation   shall  pay  any   dividends  or  other
distributions  with a record  date  prior to the  Effective  Time that have been
declared or made by  FloridaFirst  in respect of shares of  FloridaFirst  Common
Stock in accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement and that remain unpaid at
the Effective Time,  subject to compliance by FloridaFirst  with Section 5.9(b).
Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by BB&T on the BB&T Common
Stock,  the  record  date for  which  is at or after  the  Effective  Time,  the
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares of BB&T
Common  Stock  issuable  pursuant  to this  Agreement,  but no dividend or other
distribution  payable to the  holders of record of BB&T  Common  Stock as of any
time  subsequent to the  Effective  Time shall be delivered to the holder of any
certificate representing  FloridaFirst Common Stock until such holder surrenders
such certificate for exchange as provided in this Section 2.8. Upon surrender of
such  certificate,  both the Merger  Consideration  (without  interest)  and any
undelivered  dividends payable hereunder  (without  interest) shall be delivered
and paid with respect to the shares of FloridaFirst  Common Stock represented by
such certificate.

2.9     Conversion of Stock Options
        ---------------------------

     (a) At the Effective Time, each Stock Option then outstanding (and which by
its terms does not lapse on or before the Effective  Time),  whether or not then
exercisable,  shall be  converted  into and become  rights with  respect to BB&T
Common  Stock,  and BB&T shall assume each Stock Option in  accordance  with the
terms of the Stock Option Plans,  subject to the following  provisions  from and
after the  Effective  Time:  (i) BB&T and its  Compensation  Committee  shall be
substituted for FloridaFirst and the Committee under the Stock Option Plans with
respect to administering  the Stock Option Plans, (ii) each Stock Option assumed
by BB&T may be  exercised  solely for  shares of BB&T  Common  Stock,  (iii) the
number of shares of BB&T Common Stock subject to each such Stock Option shall be
the number of whole shares of BB&T (omitting any fractional share) determined by
multiplying  the number of shares of  FloridaFirst  Common Stock subject to such
Stock Option  immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and
(iv) the per share exercise price under each such Stock Option shall be adjusted
by dividing  the per share  exercise  price under each such Stock  Option by the
Exchange  Ratio  and  rounding  up to  the  nearest  cent.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  BB&T may at its election substitute as of the Effective Time options
under the BB&T  Corporation  1995 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan or any other duly
adopted  comparable  plan (in either case,  the "BB&T Option Plan") for all or a
part  of the  Stock  Options,  subject  to the  following  conditions:  (A)  the
requirements of (iii) and (iv) above shall be

                                       12

<PAGE>

met; (B) such  substitution  shall not constitute a  modification,  extension or
renewal  of any of the Stock  Options;  and (C) the  substituted  options  shall
continue  in effect on the same terms and  conditions  as  provided in the stock
option  agreements  governing  each Stock Option and in the Stock Option  Plans.
Each grant of a converted or substitute  option to any individual who subsequent
to the  Merger  will  be a  director  or  officer  of BB&T  as  construed  under
Commission Rule 16b-3 shall, as a condition to such conversion or  substitution,
be approved in accordance  with the provisions of Rule 16b-3.  Each Stock Option
which is an incentive  stock option shall be adjusted as required by Section 424
of the Code, and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, so as to continue as an
incentive  stock  option  under  Section  424(a) of the  Code,  and so as not to
constitute  a  modification,  extension,  or renewal  of the  option  within the
meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. BB&T and  FloridaFirst  agree to take all
necessary steps to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.9. BB&T
has reserved and shall continue to reserve  adequate shares of BB&T Common Stock
for delivery upon exercise of any  converted or substitute  options.  As soon as
practicable  after the Effective Time, if it has not already done so, and to the
extent  FloridaFirst  shall  have  a  registration  statement  in  effect  or an
obligation  to file a  registration  statement,  BB&T shall file a  registration
statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or other
appropriate  forms),  with respect to the shares of BB&T Common Stock subject to
converted or substitute options and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain
the  effectiveness  of such  registration  statement  (and  maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses  contained therein) for so long as such
converted  or  substitute  options  remain  outstanding.  With  respect to those
individuals,  if  any,  who  subsequent  to the  Merger  may be  subject  to the
reporting  requirements  under  Section  16(a) of the Exchange  Act,  BB&T shall
administer  the Stock Option Plans assumed  pursuant to this Section 2.9 (or the
BB&T Option  Plan,  if  applicable)  in a manner that  complies  with Rule 16b-3
promulgated  under the Exchange Act to the extent necessary to preserve for such
individuals  the  benefits  of Rule  16b-3  to the  extent  such  benefits  were
available to them prior to the Effective Time.  FloridaFirst  hereby  represents
that the Stock Option Plans in their  current form comply with Rule 16b-3 to the
extent, if any,  required as of the date hereof.  Stock Options may be exercised
prior to the  Effective  Time to the extent  they may be  exercised  pursuant to
their respective terms.

     (b) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, BB&T shall deliver
to the participants  receiving  converted  options under the BB&T Option Plan an
appropriate notice setting forth such participant's rights pursuant thereto.

     (c) Eligibility to receive stock option grants following the Effective Time
with respect to BB&T Common Stock shall be determined by BB&T in accordance with
its plans and  procedures  as in effect  from time to time,  and  subject to any
contractual obligations.

                                       13

2.10    No Right to Dissent
        -------------------

     Nothing in the  Articles  of  Incorporation  or the Bylaws of  FloridaFirst
provides  or would  provide to any  person,  including  without  limitation  the
FloridaFirst shareholders,  upon execution of this Agreement, the Plan of Merger
or the BB&T Option Agreement and  consummation of the transactions  contemplated
hereby and thereby, rights of dissent and appraisal of any kind.

2.11    Anti-Dilution
        -------------

     In the event BB&T  changes the number of shares of BB&T Common Stock issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split,  stock
dividend or other similar recapitalization,  and the record date thereof (in the
case of a stock  dividend) or the effective date thereof (in the case of a stock
split or similar  recapitalization  for which a record date is not  established)
shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in Section 2.7(a)
and (b) shall be proportionately adjusted.

                                   ARTICLE III
                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF FLORIDAFIRST

     Except  as  Disclosed,  FloridaFirst  represents  and  warrants  to BB&T as
follows (the  representations  and warranties  herein of  FloridaFirst  are made
subject to the  applicable  standard  set forth in Section  6.3(a),  and no such
representation  or  warranty  shall be  deemed  to be  inaccurate  unless  it is
inaccurate to the extent that BB&T would be entitled to refuse to consummate the
Merger pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) on account of such inaccuracy):

3.1     Capital Structure
        -----------------

     The authorized capital stock of FloridaFirst consists of 80,0000,000 shares

Stock issued and  outstanding,  and no shares of  FloridaFirst  preferred  stock

     414(m) and 414(o) of the Code, of which  FloridaFirst  or any  FloridaFirst
     Subsidiary  is a member.  For purposes of this  Agreement,  the term "Plan"
     shall  mean a plan,  arrangement,  agreement  or program  described  in the
     foregoing   provisions   of  this  Section   3.14(b)(i)   that  is:  (A)  a

     potential  liability with respect to (A) any multiemployer  plan as defined
     in Section 3(37) of ERISA,  (B) any plan of the type  described in Sections

                                       21

<PAGE>


          (iii)  None  of  the Plans obligates FloridaFirst or any  FloridaFirst
     Subsidiary  to  pay  separation,  severance,  termination  or  similar-type
     benefits  solely  as a  result  of any  transaction  contemplated  by  this
     Agreement  or solely as a result of a "change in  control," as such term is
     used in Section 280G of the Code (and regulations promulgated thereunder).

          (iv) Each Plan, and all related trusts, insurance contracts and funds,
     has been maintained,  funded and administered in compliance in all respects
     with its own terms and in compliance  in all respects  with all  applicable
     laws and  regulations,  including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. No
     actions,  suits,  claims,  complaints,   charges,  proceedings,   hearings,
     examinations,  investigations,  audits or demands with respect to the Plans
     (other than routine  claims for  benefits) are pending or  threatened,  and
     there are no facts  which could give rise to or be expected to give rise to
     any actions, suits, claims,  complaints,  charges,  proceedings,  hearings,
     examinations, investigations, audits or demands. No Plan that is subject to
     the funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA
     has incurred any "accumulated  funding  deficiency" as such term is defined
     in such  Sections of ERISA and the Code,  whether or not  waived,  and each
     Plan has always fully met the funding  standards  required under Title I of
     ERISA and  Section 412 of the Code.  No  liability  to the Pension  Benefit
     Guaranty  Corporation ("PBGC") (except for routine payment of premiums) has
     been or is expected to be incurred with respect to any Plan that is subject
     to Title IV of ERISA,  no  reportable  event (as such  term is  defined  in
     Section  4043 of  ERISA)  for  which  the PBGC has not  waived  notice  has
     occurred  with respect to any such Plan,  and the PBGC has not commenced or
     threatened the  termination of any Plan. None of the assets of FloridaFirst
     or any  FloridaFirst  Subsidiary  is the subject of any lien arising  under
     Section 302(f) of ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code, neither FloridaFirst
     nor any  FloridaFirst  Subsidiary  has been  required to post any  security
     pursuant to Section  307 of ERISA or Section  401(a)(29)  of the Code,  and
     there are no facts  which  could be  expected  to give rise to such lien or
     such  posting of security.  No event has  occurred and no condition  exists
     that would subject  FloridaFirst or any FloridaFirst  Subsidiary to any tax
     under Sections 4971,  4972,  4976, 4977 or 4979 of the Code or to a fine or
     penalty under Section 502(c) of ERISA.

          (v) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
     the Code,  and each trust (if any) forming a part  thereof,  has received a
     favorable  determination  letter from the IRS as to the qualification under
     the Code of such Plan and the tax exempt status of such related trust,  and
     nothing has occurred since the date of such determination letter that could
     adversely affect the qualification of such Plan or the tax exempt status of
     such related trust.

          (vi) No underfunded "defined benefit plan" (as such term is defined in
     Section  3(35) of ERISA)  has been,  during the five  years  preceding  the
     Closing  Date,  transferred  out of the  controlled  group of  corporations
     (within the meaning

                                       22

<PAGE>


     of Sections 414(b),  (c), (m) and (o) of the Code) of which FloridaFirst or
     any  FloridaFirst  Subsidiary  is a  member  or was a  member  during  such
     five-year period.

          (vii) As of September 30, 2001, the fair market value of the assets of
     each Plan that is a tax qualified defined benefit plan equaled or exceeded,
     and as of the Closing Date will equal or exceed,  the present  value of all
     vested and nonvested  liabilities  thereunder determined in accordance with
     reasonable  actuarial  methods,  factors and  assumptions  applicable  to a
     defined benefit plan on an ongoing basis. With respect to each Plan that is
     subject to the funding  requirements of Section 412 of the Code and Section

with respect to its business and affairs  before it is filed with the Commission

and  consult  with  BB&T  on the  form  of,  and any  characterizations  of such
information included in, the Registration Statement prior to the filing with the
Commission. Such Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective and on
the Effective Time,  shall in all material  respects conform to the requirements
of  the  Securities  Act  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the
Commission.   The  Registration  Statement  shall  include  the  form  of  Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.  BB&T and FloridaFirst shall use all reasonable efforts to
cause  the Proxy  Statement/Prospectus  to be  approved  by the  Commission  for
mailing to the FloridaFirst  shareholders,  and such Proxy  Statement/Prospectus

        -------------------------------------

     At the Effective  Time, the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the
Plan of Merger.  In  connection  therewith,  BB&T  acknowledges  that it (i) has
adopted and approved this Agreement and the Plan of Merger, and (ii) will pay or
cause to be paid  when due the  Merger  Consideration.  BB&T  has  reserved  for
issuance such number of shares of BB&T Common Stock as shall be necessary to pay
the Merger  Consideration and agrees not to take any action that would cause the
aggregate  number  of  authorized  shares of BB&T  Common  Stock  available  for
issuance hereunder not to be sufficient to effect the Merger. If at any time the
aggregate number of shares of BB&T Common Stock reserved for issuance  hereunder
is not sufficient to effect the Merger,  BB&T shall take all appropriate  action
as may be  required  to  increase  the  number of shares  of BB&T  Common  Stock
reserved for such purpose.

reasonably necessary to modify the structure of, or to substitute parties to (so
long  as  such  substitute  is  BB&T  or a  BB&T  Subsidiary)  the  transactions
contemplated  hereby,  provided that such modifications do not change the Merger
Consideration or abrogate the covenants and other  agreements  contained in this

               (j) enter into or substantially modify (except as may be required
          by  applicable  law or  regulation)  any  pension,  retirement,  stock
          option,  stock purchase,  stock appreciation  right,  savings,  profit

          any Person that has made, or that the FloridaFirst  Board of Directors
          determines  in good  faith is  reasonably  likely to make,  a Superior
          Offer,  if the  FloridaFirst  Board of  Directors  determines  in good
          faith, after  consultation with outside legal counsel,  that it should
          take such  actions in light of its  fiduciary  duty to  FloridaFirst's
          shareholders;

               (l)  enter  into  (i)  any  material  agreement,  arrangement  or

5.12    Section 401(k) Plan; Other Employee Benefits
        --------------------------------------------

     (a)  Effective on the Benefit Plan  Determination  Date with respect to the
401(k)  plan of  FloridaFirst,  BB&T shall cause such plan to be merged with the
401(k) plan maintained by BB&T and the BB&T Subsidiaries,  or to be frozen or to
be terminated,  in each case as determined by BB&T and subject to the receipt of
all  applicable   regulatory  or  governmental   approvals.   Each  employee  of
FloridaFirst  at the Effective  Time (i) who is a participant in the 401(k) plan
of  FloridaFirst,  (ii)  who  becomes  an  employee  immediately  following  the
Effective Time of BB&T or of any  subsidiary of BB&T  ("Employer  Entity"),  and
(iii) who continues in the  employment  of an Employer  Entity until the Benefit
Plan Determination Date for the 401(k) plan, shall be eligible to participate in
BB&T's 401(k) plan as of the Benefit Plan  Determination  Date. Any other former
employee of  FloridaFirst  who is employed by an Employer Entity on or after the
Benefit Plan  Determination  Date shall be eligible to be a  participant  in the
BB&T 401(k) plan upon complying  with  eligibility  requirements.  All rights to
participate  in BB&T's  401(k)  plan are  subject  to  BB&T's  right to amend or
terminate  the plan.  Until the  Benefit  Plan  Determination  Date,  BB&T shall
continue in effect for the benefit of participating employees the Section 401(k)
plan of FloridaFirst.  For purposes of administering BB&T's 401(k) plan, service
with  FloridaFirst  and the  FloridaFirst  Subsidiaries  shall be  deemed  to be
service with BB&T for participation  and vesting purposes,  but not for purposes
of benefit accrual.  Each employee of FloridaFirst or a FloridaFirst  Subsidiary
at the  Effective  Time  who  becomes  an  employee  immediately  following  the
Effective  Time of an Employer  Entity is  referred to herein as a  "Transferred
Employee."

     (b) Each  Transferred  Employee  shall be eligible to  participate in group
hospitalization,  medical,  dental,  life,  disability and other welfare benefit
plans and programs available to employees of the Employer Entity, subject to the
terms of such plans and programs,  as of the Benefit Plan Determination Date for
each such plan or program,  conditional  upon the Transferred  Employee's  being
employed by an Employer  Entity as of such Benefit Plan  Determination  Date and
subject to complying with  eligibility  requirements of the respective plans and
programs.  With respect to health care coverages,  participation in BB&T's plans
may be subject to availability of HMO options. In any case in which HMO coverage
is not  available,  substitute  coverage will be provided which may not be fully
comparable  to the HMO  coverage.  With  respect to any welfare  benefit plan or
program  of  FloridaFirst  that  the  Employer  Entity  determines,  in its sole
discretion,  provides benefits of the same type or class as a corresponding plan
or program maintained by the Employer Entity, the Employer Entity shall continue
such  FloridaFirst  plan or program in effect for the benefit of the Transferred
Employees so long as they remain  eligible to  participate  and until they shall
become  eligible to become  participants  in the  corresponding  plan or program
maintained  by the  Employer  Entity  (and,  with  respect  to any such  plan or
program,  subject to complying with eligibility  requirements and subject to the
right of the Employer  Entity to terminate  such plan or program).  If the first
plan year of  participation  in any group health plan of an Employer Entity by a

                                       39

<PAGE>


Transferred  Employee  is a partial  year,  the  Employer  Entity will give such
Transferred  Employee and his or her dependents  credit toward  deductibles  and
out-of-pocket  maximums for eligible expenses incurred by such persons under the
FloridaFirst  group  health  plan  during  that  portion  of that plan year that
precedes entry into the group health plans of the Employer Entity.  For purposes
of administering the welfare plans and programs subject to this Section 5.12(b),
service with FloridaFirst shall be deemed to be service with the Employer Entity
for the  purpose of  determining  eligibility  to  participate  and  vesting (if
applicable)  in such  welfare  plans and  programs,  but not for the  purpose of
computing  benefits,  if any,  determined in whole or in part with  reference to
service (except as otherwise provided in Section 5.12(c)).

     (c)  Except  to the  extent  of  commitments  herein  or other  contractual
commitments,  if any,  specifically made or assumed  hereunder by BB&T,  neither
BB&T nor any Employer  Entity shall have any obligation  arising from the Merger
to continue any Transferred Employees in its employ or in any specific job or to
provide to any  Transferred  Employee any specified level of compensation or any
incentive payments,  benefits or perquisites.  Each Transferred  Employee who is
terminated by an Employer Entity subsequent to the Effective Time, excluding any
employee who has a then  existing  contract  providing for  severance,  shall be
entitled to severance pay in  accordance  with the general  severance  policy of
BB&T then in effect or the general severance policy of FloridaFirst as in effect
on September  1, 2002,  if and to the extent that such  Transferred  Employee is
entitled to  severance  pay under the  applicable  policy.  Prior to the Closing
Date,  FloridaFirst  shall determine  which of such severance  policies shall be
applicable and shall give BB&T notice thereof, and the selected severance policy
shall apply with respect to all Transferred Employees. If BB&T shall not receive
such notice  prior to the  Closing  Date,  FloridaFirst  shall be deemed to have
selected the BB&T severance  policy.  Each Transferred  Employee's  service with
FloridaFirst or a FloridaFirst  Subsidiary shall be treated as service with BB&T
for purposes of  determining  the amount of severance  pay, if any, under BB&T's
severance  policy,  and  each  Transferred  Employee's  service  with  BB&T or a
Subsidiary of BB&T shall be treated as service with FloridaFirst for purposes of
determining the amount of severance pay, if any, under FloridaFirst's  severance
policy.

     (d) BB&T agrees to honor (i) the  FloridaFirst  Bank 1999 Restricted  Stock
Plan and 2002 Restricted Stock Plan, (ii) all employment  agreements,  severance
agreements  and  deferred  compensation  agreements  that  FloridaFirst  and the
FloridaFirst  Subsidiaries  have with their  current  and former  employees  and
directors  and which have been  Disclosed  to BB&T  pursuant to this  Agreement,
except to the extent any such  agreements  shall be  superseded or terminated at

described in the  preceding  sentence  and except as otherwise  provided in this
Section 5.12,  the employee  benefit plans of  FloridaFirst  shall,  in the sole

     (e) Notwithstanding and without limiting the generality of Section 5.12(d),
as soon as  practicable  following the date hereof but in any event prior to the
Effective  Time,  FloridaFirst  shall  take  any and  all  action  necessary  to
terminate the FloridaFirst Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") as of the
Effective  Time, to repay any outstanding  indebtedness  thereof and to allocate
shares of  FloridaFirst  Common Stock and other trust assets held thereby to the
participants  therein in  accordance  with the terms thereof as in effect on the
date hereof.  The ESOP shall not make any  purchases  of shares of  FloridaFirst
Common Stock after the date hereof.

5.13    Directors' and Officers' Protection
        -----------------------------------

     BB&T or a BB&T  Subsidiary  shall provide and keep in force for a period of
three  years  after  the  Effective  Time  directors'  and  officers'  liability
insurance  providing coverage to directors and officers of FloridaFirst for acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time. Such insurance shall provide
at least the same coverage and amounts as contained in FloridaFirst's  policy on
the date  hereof;  provided,  that in no event shall the annual  premium on such
policy exceed 150% of the annual premium  payments on  FloridaFirst's  policy in
effect  as of the date  hereof  (the  "Maximum  Amount").  If the  amount of the
premiums  necessary to maintain or procure such insurance  coverage  exceeds the
Maximum  Amount,  BB&T shall use its  reasonable  efforts to  maintain  the most
advantageous policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance obtainable
for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  BB&T
further  agrees to  indemnify  all  individuals  who are or have been  officers,
directors or employees of FloridaFirst or any  FloridaFirst  Subsidiary prior to
the Effective  Time from any acts or omissions in such  capacities  prior to the
Effective Time, and to advance  indemnifiable  expenses, to the extent that such
indemnification  or advance is provided or permitted pursuant to the Articles of
Incorporation  or Bylaws of  FloridaFirst  on the date  hereof and is  permitted
under the FBCA and the NCBCA.

5.14    Forbearances of BB&T
        --------------------

     Except with the prior  written  consent of  FloridaFirst,  between the date
hereof and the Effective Time,  neither BB&T nor any BB&T Subsidiary  shall take
any action  which is  reasonably  likely to (i) cause the  business  combination
contemplated hereby not to constitute a reorganization  under Section 368 of the
Code; (ii) result in any inaccuracy of a representation  or warranty herein that
would allow for termination of this Agreement; (iii) cause any of the conditions
precedent  to the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  to fail to be
satisfied;  or (iv)  fail to  comply  in any  material  respect  with any  laws,
regulations,  ordinances  or  governmental  actions  applicable to it and to the
conduct of its business.

the Commission and any other regulatory  authorities  having  jurisdiction  over
such  party,  and shall  deliver  to BB&T or  FloridaFirst,  as the case may be,
copies of all such  reports  promptly  after the same are  filed.  If  financial
statements  are contained in any such reports,  such financial  statements  will
fairly  present the  consolidated  financial  position of the entity filing such
statements as of the dates indicated and the consolidated results of operations,
changes in  shareholders'  equity,  and cash flows for the periods then ended in
accordance with GAAP (subject in the case of interim financial statements to the
absence  of notes  and to normal  recurring  year-end  adjustments  that are not
material).  As of their respective dates, such reports filed with the Commission
will  comply in all  material  respects  with the  Securities  Laws and will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required  to be stated  therein  or  necessary  in order to make the  statements
therein,  in  light  of the  circumstances  under  which  they  were  made,  not
misleading.  Any  financial  statements  contained  in any  other  reports  to a
regulatory  authority other than the Commission  shall be prepared in accordance
with requirements applicable to such reports.

5.16    Exchange Listing
        ----------------

Board Establishment Date") no later than the effective time of the merger of the
last  FloridaFirst  subsidiary  which is a  savings  institution  into a banking
subsidiary  of BB&T,  BB&T  shall  offer to each of the  members of the Board of
Directors of FloridaFirst a seat on the Advisory Board for the Lakeland, Florida
area.  During the period  following  the  Effective  Time and until the Advisory
Board  Establishment Date, the directors of FloridaFirst shall continue to serve
as such so long as they continue to meet the  requirements  for serving,  and in
applying  this Section 5.17  service  during such period as a director  shall be
deemed to be service as an Advisory  Board member.  For two years  following the
Effective  Time, the Advisory Board members  appointed  pursuant to this Section
5.17 who are not  employees of BB&T or a BB&T  Affiliate or under  contract with
BB&T or any  BB&T  Affiliate,  and who  continue  to  serve  shall  receive,  as
compensation  for service on the Advisory  Board,  Advisory  Board member's fees
(annual  retainer and  attendance  fees) equal in amount each year (prorated for
any partial  year) to the annual  retainer and schedule of  attendance  fees for
directors  of  FloridaFirst  in effect on  September  1,  2002.  Following  such
two-year  period,  Advisory  Board  Members,  if they  continue to serve in such
capacity, shall receive fees in accordance with BB&T's standard schedule of fees
for  service  thereon as in effect  from time to time.  For two years

                                       42

<PAGE>


after the Effective Time, no such Advisory Board member shall be prohibited from
serving  thereon  because  he or she shall have  attained  the  maximum  age for
service thereon  (currently age 70). In the event BB&T shall establish a Florida
State Advisory Board prior to the date that Nis H. Nissen,  III shall attain his
70th birthday,  Nis H. Nissen,  III shall be offered a seat on the Florida State
Advisory  Board.  Membership  of any  person  on any  Advisory  Board  shall  be
conditional  upon execution of an agreement  providing that such person will not
engage in activities competitive with BB&T for two years following the Effective
Time or, if longer, the period that he or she is a member of the Advisory Board.

     (b) At any time prior to the  Effective  Time,  by either  party (i) in the
event of a  material  breach by the other  party of any  covenant  or  agreement
contained  in this  Agreement,  or (ii) in the  event  of an  inaccuracy  of any
representation or warranty of the other party contained in this Agreement, which
inaccuracy  would  provide  the  nonbreaching  party  the  ability  to refuse to
consummate the Merger under the applicable  standard set forth in Section 6.2(a)
in the case of FloridaFirst  and Section 6.3(a) in the case of BB&T; and, in the

writing,  if any of the  conditions  precedent to the  obligations  of the other
party to consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby cannot be satisfied or
fulfilled  prior to the Closing Date,  and the party giving the notice is not in
material  breach  of  any  of  its  representations,  warranties,  covenants  or
undertakings  herein,  or at any time prior to the Effective Time by BB&T if the
condition in Section 6.3(b) shall not be met.

representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings herein.

     (g) Automatically on the Determination Date, without any action on the part
of BB&T or FloridaFirst, if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

               (1) the Converted Value shall be less than $19.11; and

               (2) (i) the  quotient  obtained by dividing  the Average  Closing

The election  contemplated  by the  preceding  sentence  shall be made by giving
notice to  FloridaFirst  of such  election  and the revised  Exchange  Ratio and
Cash/Stock Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant
to this Section 7.1(g),  and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance
with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio and Cash/Stock Exchange Ratio shall
have been so  modified).  If the Closing  Date shall occur  during the  five-day

interpreted  as a consent  by BB&T to any  action or matter  that would have the
effect of diminishing or adversely affecting BB&T's rights under the BB&T Option
Agreement.

7.3     Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants
        -----------------------------------------------------

     All representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement or the Plan
of Merger or in any instrument delivered pursuant hereto or thereto shall expire
on, and be  terminated  and  extinguished  at, the  Effective  Time,  other than
covenants  that by their  terms are to be  performed  after the  Effective  Time
(including  Sections  5.13 and  5.17);  provided  that no such  representations,
warranties or covenants  shall be deemed to be terminated or  extinguished so as
to deprive BB&T or FloridaFirst (or any director,  officer or controlling person
thereof) of any defense at law or in equity which  otherwise  would be available
against the claims of any person, including, without limitation, any shareholder
or  former   shareholder   of  either  BB&T  or   FloridaFirst,   the  aforesaid
representations,   warranties  and  covenants  being  material   inducements  to
consummation by BB&T and FloridaFirst of the transactions contemplated herein.

        ------

     Except with respect to any required regulatory approval, each party hereto,
by written  instrument  signed by an executive officer of such party, may at any
time (whether  before or after  approval of the Agreement and the Plan of Merger
by the FloridaFirst  shareholders) extend the time for the performance of any of
the  obligations  or other acts of the other party  hereto and may waive (i) any
inaccuracies of the other party in the  representations or warranties  contained
in this Agreement,  the Plan of Merger or any

covenants, undertakings or agreements of the other party, or satisfaction of any
of the conditions precedent to its obligations,  contained herein or in the Plan
of Merger, or (iii) the performance by the other party of any of its obligations
set out  herein or  therein;  provided  that no such  extension  or  waiver,  or

the  FloridaFirst  shareholders of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger,  shall
reduce the Exchange Ratio or the amount or form of the Merger Consideration.
