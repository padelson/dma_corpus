as follows:

  



  

Article I _ 
 MERGER_

  



  

1.1 _Merger_. At the Effective Time, and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Delaware Act, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall
consummate the Merger, pursuant to which Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into Purchaser, following which the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and Purchaser shall continue as the surviving corporation.
Purchaser, as the surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ " (provided, that
references to Purchaser for periods after the Effective Time shall include
the Surviving Corporation).

  



  

1.2 _Effective Time_. Purchaser and Merger Sub shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger for the merger of Merger Sub
with and into Purchaser (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the Delaware Act (the time of such filing, or such later time as may be
specified in the Certificate of Merger, being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the
applicable provisions of the Delaware Act. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, agreements, powers and franchises, debts, Liabilities,
duties and obligations of Merger Sub and Purchaser shall become the property,
rights, privileges, agreements, powers and franchises, debts,
Liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving Corporation (including
all rights and obligations with respect to the Trust Account), which shall
include the assumption by the Surviving Corporation of any and all agreements,
covenants, duties and obligations of Merger Sub and Purchaser set forth in
this Agreement to be performed after the Effective Time.

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

1.4 _Organizational Documents of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Purchaser, each as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease and the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the respective
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, the board of directors and executive officers of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the board of directors and executive officers
of Pubco, after giving effect to _Section 8.15_ , each to hold office in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified.

  



  

1.6 _Effect of Merger on Issued Securities of Purchaser_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party
or the holders of securities of Purchaser, Pubco or Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) _Purchaser Units_. At the Effective Time, every issued and outstanding
Purchaser Unit shall be automatically detached and the holder thereof shall
be deemed to hold one share of Purchaser Class A Common Stock, one-half of a
Purchaser Warrant and one Purchaser Right in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Purchaser Unit, which underlying Purchaser Securities shall be
converted in accordance with the applicable terms of this _Section 1.6_
below.

  



  

(b) _Purchaser Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, every issued and
outstanding share of Purchaser Common Stock (other than those described in
_Section 1.6(g)_ below) shall be converted automatically into one Pubco
Ordinary Share, following which, all shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall
cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist. The holders of certificates previously evidencing shares of Purchaser
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as provided herein or
by Law. Each certificate previously evidencing shares of Purchaser Common
Stock shall be exchanged for a certificate (if requested) representing the
same number of Pubco Ordinary Shares upon the surrender of such certificate
in accordance with _Section 1.7_. Each certificate formerly representing
shares of Purchaser Common Stock (other those described in _Section 1.6(g)_
below) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the same number
of Pubco Ordinary Shares. To the extent required by Section 262 of the
Delaware Act, each certificate formerly representing shares of Purchaser
Common Stock owned by holders of Purchaser Common Stock who have validly
elected to dissent from the Merger pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware
Act shall thereafter represent only the right to receive fair value for
their shares of Purchaser Common Stock in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Delaware Act.

  



  

(c) _Purchaser Preferred Shares_. At the Effective Time, every issued and
outstanding Purchaser Preferred Share (other than those described in _Section
1.6(g)_ below), if any, shall be converted automatically into one Pubco
Preferred Share, following which, all Purchaser Preferred Shares shall cease
to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist. The holders of certificates previously evidencing Purchaser Preferred
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares, except as provided herein or by
Law. Each certificate previously evidencing Purchaser Preferred Shares shall
be exchanged for a certificate representing the same number of Pubco Preferred
Shares upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with _Section
1.7_. Each certificate formerly representing Purchaser Preferred Shares
(other those described in _Section 1.6(g)_ below) shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the same number of Pubco Preferred Shares. To the
extent required by Section 262 of the Delaware Act, each certificate formerly
representing Purchaser Preferred Shares owned by holders of Purchaser
Preferred Shares who have validly elected to dissent from the Merger pursuant
to Section 262 of the Delaware Act shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive fair value for their Purchaser Preferred Shares in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Delaware Act.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

(d) _Purchaser Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Purchaser
Public Warrant shall be converted into one Pubco Public Warrant and each
outstanding Purchaser Private Warrant shall be converted into one Pubco
Private Warrant. At the Effective Time, the Purchaser Warrants shall cease to
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist. Each of the Pubco Public Warrants shall have, and be subject to,
substantially the same terms and conditions set forth in the Purchaser Public
Warrants, and each of the Pubco Private Warrants shall have, and be subject
to, substantially the same terms and conditions set forth in the Purchaser
Private Warrants, except that in each case they shall represent the right to
acquire Pubco Ordinary Shares in lieu of shares of Purchaser Class A Common
Stock. At or prior to the Effective Time, Pubco shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for future issuance, and shall maintain such
reservation for so long as any of the Pubco Warrants remain outstanding, a
sufficient number of Pubco Ordinary Shares for delivery upon the exercise of
such Pubco Warrants.

  



  

(e) _Purchaser Rights_. At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding
Purchaser Right shall be automatically converted into the number of Pubco
Ordinary Shares that would have been received by the holder thereof if the
Purchaser Right had been converted upon the consummation of a Business
Combination in accordance with Purchaser's Organizational Documents, the IPO
Prospectus and the Right Agreement into shares of Purchaser Class A Common
Stock, but for such purposes treating it as if such Business Combination had
occurred immediately prior to the Effective Time and the shares of Purchaser
Class A Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Purchaser Rights had then
automatically been converted into Pubco Ordinary Shares in accordance with
_Section 1.6(b)_  above. At the Effective Time, the Purchaser Rights shall
cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist. The holders of certificates previously evidencing
Purchaser Rights outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Purchaser Rights, except as
provided herein or by Law. Each certificate formerly representing Purchaser
Rights shall thereafter represent only the right to receive Pubco Ordinary
Shares as set forth herein.

  



  

(f) _Purchaser UPO_. At the Effective Time, the Purchaser UPO shall be
cancelled and converted into an identical right to acquire the
same securities of Pubco that the holder thereof would have received if the
Purchaser UPO were to have been exercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time (notwithstanding the provisions thereof prohibiting exercise at such
time), including any successor securities to such Pubco securities, and shall
no longer represent the right to receive securities of Purchaser.

  



  

(g) _Cancellation of Capital Stock Owned by Purchaser_. At the Effective
Time, if there are any shares of capital stock of Purchaser that are owned by
Purchaser as treasury shares, such shares shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or payment therefor.

  



  

(h) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for securities of Purchaser
is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer)
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Purchaser or any agent designated by it any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
for securities of Purchaser in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of
Purchaser or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  



  

   

4

 



    



  

(i) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
1.6_ , none of the Surviving Corporation, Pubco or any Party hereto shall be
liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

1.7 _Effect of Merger on Merger Sub and Pubco Capital Shares_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any Party or the holders of any shares of capital stock of Purchaser, Pubco or
Merger Sub: (a) all of the shares of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an
equal number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation; and (b) all of the shares of Pubco issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or payment therefor.

  



  

1.8 _Surrender of Purchaser Certificates_. All securities issued upon the
surrender of Purchaser Securities in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such securities, provided that any restrictions on the sale and transfer of
Purchaser Securities shall also apply to the Pubco Securities so issued in
exchange.

  



  

1.9 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Purchaser Certificates_. In the event any
certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Pubco shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates or securities, as the
case may be, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such securities, as may be required pursuant to _Section 1.6_ ;
_provided_ , however, that the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

1.10 _Tax Consequences_. The Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger and the Acquisition, taken
together, are intended to qualify as exchanges described in Section 351 of the
Code. The Parties hereby agree to file all Tax and other informational
returns on a basis consistent with such characterization. Each of the Parties
acknowledge and agree that each (i) has had the opportunity to obtain
independent legal and tax advice with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) is responsible for paying its own

Article II _ 
 SECURITIES EXCHANGE_

  



  

2.1 _Exchange of Company Securities_. At the Closing, and subject to and upon
the terms and conditions of this Agreement:

  



  

(a) the Sellers shall sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to Pubco,
and Pubco shall purchase, acquire and accept from the Sellers, all of the
issued and outstanding Company Shares (collectively, the " _Purchased Shares_
"), free and clear of all Liens (other than potential restrictions on resale
under applicable securities Laws), and

  



  

(b) each issued and outstanding Company Convertible Security shall be assumed
by Pubco (as so assumed by Pubco, an " _Assumed Convertible Security_ "), and
shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions set forth in
such Company Convertible Security (including the same vesting schedule, if
applicable), except that each Company Convertible Security shall be amended
as an Assumed Convertible Security such that (i) Pubco Ordinary Shares shall
be substituted for any capital shares of the Company that otherwise would
have been acquired under such Company Convertible Security, (ii) the number of
Pubco Ordinary Shares that can be acquired under such Assumed Company
Security shall instead be equal to (as rounded down to the nearest
whole number) (A) the number of Company Ordinary Shares (treating Company
Preferred Shares on an as-converted to Company Ordinary Share basis, as if
the Company had liquidated at such time) which the Company Convertible
Security had the right to acquire or convert into immediately prior to the
Closing, multiplied by (B) the Conversion Ratio, and (iii) the exercise or
conversion price of such Assumed Convertible Security shall be instead equal
to (as rounded up to the nearest whole cent) the quotient of (A) the
exercise or conversion price of the Company Convertible Security (if not
expressed in U.S. dollars, as converted into U.S. Dollars based on the
applicable exchange rate using the Fed Noon Buying Rate on the Closing Date),
divided by (B) the Conversion Ratio; provided, that with respect to each
Company Option that becomes an Assumed Convertible Security (an " _Assumed
Option_ "), it shall also be amended to provide that notwithstanding its
current vesting schedule or expiration date, (I) it will be exercisable on a
cashless basis, (II) fifty percent (50%) of the unvested portion of the
Company Option will accelerate and become vested as of the Closing, (III) any
remaining unvested portion of the Company Option will vest on the one (1) year
anniversary of the Closing Date and (IV) if as of the Closing, after giving
effect to clause (II) above, it is (x) vested, it will expire and terminate
on the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the Closing Date or (y) unvested, it

anniversary of the Closing Date.

  



  

2.2 _Exchange Consideration_.

  



  

(a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in full
payment for the Purchased Shares, Pubco shall (i) assume the
Company Convertible Securities in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and (ii)
issue and deliver to each Seller for each Company Share held (treating
Company Preferred Shares on an as-converted to Company Ordinary Share basis,
as if the Company had liquidated at such time) a number of Pubco Ordinary
Shares equal to (x) the Per Share Price, divided by (y) the Redemption Price
(with the aggregate Pubco Ordinary Shares issuable to all Sellers hereunder
at the Closing (prior to the reduction for and holdback of the
Holdback Shares) being the " _Exchange Shares_ "). The number of Exchange
Shares issued and delivered to the Sellers at the Closing shall be subject to
the reduction and holdback of the Holdback Shares in accordance with _Section
2.3_. Additional Pubco Ordinary Shares may also be issued to the Sellers
after the Closing pursuant to _Sections 2.7_ and _2.8_.

(b) _Schedule 2.2(b)_ sets forth for illustrative purposes only a sample
capitalization table of Pubco immediately after the Closing with certain
assumptions set forth therein and assuming for such purposes that the Closing
occurred on the date of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between
the sample capitalization table in _Schedule 2.2(b)_ hereto and the terms of
this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.

  



  

2.3 _Holdback_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, ten percent
(10%) of the Exchange Shares otherwise issuable to the Sellers at the
Closing (subject to equitable adjustment for share splits, share dividends,
combinations, recapitalizations and the like after the Closing, including to
account for any equity securities into which such shares are exchanged or
converted, the " _Holdback Shares_ ") shall not be issued by Pubco at the
Closing and instead shall be held back and kept in reserve by Pubco to
satisfy any indemnity claims made in accordance with the terms of _Article IX_
hereof. To the extent that the Sellers are entitled to receive the Holdback
Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Holdback Shares
shall be allocated among and issued to the Sellers pro rata based on their
respective Pro Rata Shares. The Holdback Shares shall serve as a source of
payment of the Indemnitees' indemnity rights pursuant to _Article IX_. If the
Holdback Shares are issued to the Sellers in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, they shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the
number of Exchange Shares received by the Sellers pursuant to this _Article
II_.

  



  

(b) The Holdback Shares shall be issued by Pubco to the Sellers promptly
after the date which is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (the "
_Holdback Release Date_ "); provided, however, that the number of Holdback
Shares to be so issued after the Holdback Release Date shall be reduced by
(up to a maximum equal to the total number of Holdback Shares) (i) the
number of Holdback Shares used to satisfy indemnification claims that have
been made and resolved in accordance with _Article IX_  hereof on or prior to
the Holdback Release Date, and (ii) a number of Holdback Shares necessary to
satisfy indemnification claims that have been made in accordance with
_Article IX_ hereof and that remain unresolved on or prior to the Holdback
Release Date (" _Pending Claims_ ") (with such Holdback Shares under this
clause (ii) determined based on the amount of the indemnification claim
included in the Claim Notice provided by the Purchaser Representative under
_Article IX_ and the Pubco Share Price as of the Holdback Release Date).
After the Holdback Release Date, promptly after the final resolution of all
Pending Claims, the remaining Holdback Shares, if any, after using the
Holdback Shares to satisfy the indemnification obligations for the Pending
Claims that have been resolved, shall be issued by Pubco to the Sellers, with
each such Seller receiving its Pro Rata Share of such Holdback Shares.

  



  

2.4 _Surrender of Company Securities and Disbursement of Exchange
Consideration_.

  



  

(a) At the Closing, Pubco shall cause the Exchange Shares (less the Holdback
Shares) to be issued to the Sellers in exchange for their Company Securities
in accordance with each Seller's Pro Rata Share.

  



  

(b) At the Closing, each Seller will deliver to Pubco their Company
Securities, including any certificates representing Company Shares ("
_Company Certificates_ ") and any certificates or instruments for Company
Convertible Securities, along with applicable share power or transfer forms
reasonably acceptable to Pubco. In the event that any Company Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, in lieu of delivery of a Company
Certificate to Pubco, the Seller may instead deliver to Pubco an affidavit of
lost certificate and indemnity of loss in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Pubco (a " _Lost Certificate Affidavit_ "), which at the
reasonable discretion of Pubco may include a requirement that the owner
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate deliver a bond in such
sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Pubco or the Company with respect to the Company Shares
represented by the Company Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no fraction of
a Pubco Ordinary Share will be issued by Pubco by virtue of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, and each Person who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a Pubco Ordinary Share (after aggregating all
fractional Pubco Ordinary Shares that would otherwise be received by such
Person) shall instead have the number of Pubco Ordinary Shares issued to such
Person rounded down in the aggregate to the nearest whole Pubco Ordinary
Share.

  



  

2.5 _Seller Consent_. Each Seller, as a shareholder or other security holder
of the Company, hereby approves, authorizes and consents to the Company's
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which
it is or is required to be a party or otherwise bound, the performance by the
Company of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Each Seller
acknowledges and agrees that the consents set forth herein are intended and
shall constitute such consent of the Sellers as may be required (and shall, if
applicable, operate as a written shareholder resolution of the Company)
pursuant to the Company Organizational Documents, any other agreement in
respect of the Company to which any Seller is a party or bound and all
applicable Laws.

  



  

2.6 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. Without limiting the provisions of
_Section 12.2_ , the Company and the Sellers hereby agree that, effective at
the Closing, (a) any shareholders, voting or similar agreement among the
Company and any of the Sellers or among the Sellers with respect to the
Company's capital shares, including the Amended and Restated Shareholders
Agreement, dated as of May 7, 2013, as amended (the " _Company Shareholders
Agreement_ "), by and among the Company and the shareholders of the Company
named therein, and (b) any registration rights agreement between the Company
and its shareholders, in each case of clauses (a) and (b), shall
automatically, and without any further action by any of the Parties, terminate
in full and become null and void and of no further force and effect. Further,
each Seller and the Company hereby waive any obligations of the parties under
the Company Shareholders Agreement or the Company's Organizational Documents
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents, and any failure of the parties to comply with the terms
thereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents.

  



  

2.7 _Recapture by Sellers of Unused Assumed Options_. In the event that after
the Closing Date, and on or prior to the later of (x) the fifteen (15) month
anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) the ninetieth (90th) day after the one
(1) year anniversary of the Closing Date (such later date, the " _Option
Recapture Date_ "), any Assumed Options that were In-the-Money Company
Convertible Securities (i) that are unvested as of the Closing Date do not
vest (and accordingly are forfeited by the holder thereof without
compensation therefor) or (ii) are not exercised prior to their expiration or
termination date (and accordingly expire unused without any compensation to
the holder therefor), in each case, after giving effect to the amendments to
the Assumed Options as contemplated by _Section 2.1(b)_ hereof (collectively
" _Unused Assumed Options_ "), then promptly after the Option Recapture Date
(subject to compliance with applicable securities Laws) Pubco will issue to
the Sellers a number of Pubco Ordinary Shares (subject to equitable
adjustment for share splits, share dividends, combinations, recapitalizations
and the like after the Closing, including to account for any equity securities
into which such shares are exchanged or converted) equal to the difference
between (i) the number of Exchange Shares as was determined at the time of
the Closing in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) the number of Exchange
Shares that would have been determined at the time of Closing in accordance
with this Agreement if the Unused Assumed Options as of immediately after the
Option Recapture Date had not been issued and outstanding at time of the
Closing, with each Seller receiving its Pro Rata Share of such Pubco
Ordinary Shares.

2.8 _Earnout_.

  



  

(a) After the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
the Sellers shall have the contingent right to receive
additional consideration from Pubco based on the performance of Pubco and its
Subsidiaries, including the Company, during the calendar years 2019 and 2020
(each such calendar year, an " _Earnout Year_ " and such two-year calendar
period, the " _Earnout Period_ ") if the requirements as set forth in this
_Section 2.8_ are met. In the event that (A) the Consolidated Revenue for the
calendar year ended December 31, 2019 is at least One Hundred and Ninety-Nine
Million Singapore Dollars (S$199,000,000) (the " _2019 Revenue Target_ "),
and (B) the closing sale price of Pubco Ordinary Shares on the
principal securities exchange or securities market on which the Pubco
Ordinary Shares are then traded equals or exceeds $11.50 per share (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and
recapitalizations) (the " _2019 Share Price Target_ ") for any twenty (20)
Trading Days within any thirty (30) Trading Day period occurring in the
calendar year ended December 31, 2019, then, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall be entitled to receive from
Pubco, as additional consideration for the Acquisition, an additional Five
Hundred Thousand (500,000) Pubco Ordinary Shares (subject to equitable
adjustment for share splits, share dividends, combinations, recapitalizations
and the like after the Closing, including to account for any equity
securities into which such shares are exchanged or converted) (the "
_2019 Earnout Shares_ "). In the event that (A) the Consolidated Revenue for
the calendar year ended December 31, 2020 is at least Two Hundred and Ninety
Million Singapore Dollars (S$290,000,000) (the " _2020 Revenue Target_ " and,
each of the 2019 Revenue Target and the 2020 Revenue Target, an " _Earnout
Revenue Target_ "), and (B) the closing sale price of Pubco Ordinary Shares

subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall be
entitled to receive from Pubco, as additional consideration for the

account for any equity securities into which such shares are exchanged or
converted) (the " _2020 Earnout Shares_ ", and collectively with the 2019
Earnout Shares, the " _Earnout Shares_ "). In the event that the Earnout
Revenue Target and Earnout Share Price Target are not both met for any
Earnout Year, the Sellers shall not be entitled to receive any Earnout Shares
for such Earnout Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the event that
(A) the 2019 Revenue Target, but not the 2019 Share Price Target, is met for
the 2019 calendar year and (B) the closing sale price of Pubco Ordinary Shares
on the principal securities exchange or securities market on which the Pubco
Ordinary Shares are then traded equals or exceeds $11.50 per share (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and
recapitalizations) for any twenty (20) Trading Days within any thirty (30)
Trading Day period occurring in the calendar year ended December 31, 2020,
then the Sellers shall be entitled to receive the 2019 Earnout Shares under
this _Section 2.8_ as if 2019 Share Price Target had been met in the 2019
calendar year (other than the timing of the delivery of the 2019 Earnout
Shares as set in forth in _Section 2.8(b)_ below) (the " _2019 Lookback
Earnout_ "), and (ii) in the event that (A) the 2020 Revenue Target, but not
the 2020 Share Price Target, is met for the 2020 calendar year and (B) the
closing sale price of Pubco Ordinary Shares on the principal securities
exchange or securities market on which the Pubco Ordinary Shares are then
traded equals or exceeds $13.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock

the 2020 Earnout Shares under this _Section 2.8_ as if 2020 Share Price
Target had been met in the 2020 calendar year (other than the timing of the
delivery of the 2020 Earnout Shares as set in forth in _Section 2.8(b)_

(b) As soon as practicable (but in any event within ten (10) Business Days)
after Pubco's filing of the annual audited consolidated financial statements
for Pubco and its Subsidiaries with the SEC on Form 20-F or 10-K (or other
equivalent SEC form) for each Earnout Year, Pubco's Chief Financial Officer
will prepare and deliver to Pubco's Board of Directors a written statement
(each, an " _Earnout Statement_ ") that sets forth such Chief Financial
Officer's determination in accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.8_ of
(i) the Consolidated Revenue for such Earnout Year based on such audited
financial statements, (ii) the closing sale price of Pubco Ordinary Shares
for each Trading Day of such Earnout Year on the principal
securities exchange or securities market on which the Pubco Ordinary Shares
are then traded, and (iii) whether the Sellers are entitled to receive
Earnout Shares for such Earnout Year as a result of achieving the applicable
Earnout Revenue Target and the applicable Earnout Share Price Target. Within
thirty (30) days after receipt of the Earnout Statement, the independent
directors serving on Pubco's board of directors at such time that are
disinterested in the Earnout Shares (i.e., such independent director is not a
Seller, an Affiliate of a Seller, or an officer, director, manager, employee,
trustee or beneficiary of a Seller, nor an immediate family member of any of
the foregoing) (each, a " _Disinterested Independent Director_ ")
shall determine, by vote or consent of a majority of the Disinterested
Independent Directors, whether the applicable Earnout Revenue Target and the
applicable Earnout Share Price Target were met for such Earnout Year and
whether the Sellers are entitled to receive Earnout Shares for such Earnout
Year as a result thereof, and such determination by the Disinterested
Independent Directors shall be final and binding upon all Parties (other than
for fraud). In the event that the Earnout Revenue Target, but not the
Earnout Share Price Target, is met for any Earnout Year, the CFO shall
monitor, on at least a monthly basis, the closing sale price of Pubco
Ordinary Shares for each Trading Day of the subsequent calendar year on the
principal securities exchange or securities market on which the Pubco
Ordinary Shares are then traded to see if the Sellers are entitled to a
Lookback Earnout. If the CFO determines that the Sellers are entitled to a
Lookback Earnout, the CFO will notify the Disinterested Independent Directors
in writing, and within thirty (30) days after receipt of such written notice
from the CFO, the Disinterested Independent Directors shall determine, by
vote or consent of a majority of the Disinterested Independent Directors,
whether the Sellers are entitled to receive the Lookback Earnout for the
applicable Earnout Year as a result of achieving the applicable Earnout Share
Price Target in the subsequent calendar year, and such determination by the
Disinterested Independent Directors shall be final and binding upon all
Parties (other than for fraud). If for any Earnout Year there is a final
determination by the Disinterested Independent Directors in accordance
with this _Section 2.8(b)_ that the Sellers are entitled to receive Earnout
Shares for such Earnout Year (including pursuant to a Lookback Earnout), then
such Earnout Shares will be due upon such final determination and Pubco will
deliver such shares within ten (10) Business Days thereafter.

  



  

(c) Following the Closing (including during the Earnout Period), Pubco and
its Subsidiaries, including the Target Companies, will be entitled to operate
their respective businesses based upon the business requirements of Pubco and
its Subsidiaries. Each of Pubco and its Subsidiaries, including the Target
Companies will be permitted, following the Closing (including during the
Earnout Period), to make changes at its sole discretion to its operations,
organization, personnel, accounting practices and other aspects of its
business, including actions that may have an impact on the Consolidated
Revenue, the share price of Pubco Ordinary Shares and the ability of the
Sellers to earn the Earnout Shares, and the Sellers will not have any right to
claim the loss of all or any portion of any Earnout Shares or other damages
as a result of such decisions.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the holders of Assumed Convertible Securities
shall have no right under this Agreement to receive any of the Earnout Shares
or any additional consideration issued to the Sellers after the Closing, and
the Assumed Convertible Securities shall not be adjusted in connection with
the issuance of any Earnout Shares or other additional consideration issued to
the Sellers after the Closing.

itself for investment purposes only, and not with a view towards any resale
or distribution of such Consideration Shares; (c) has been advised and
understands that the Consideration Shares (i) are being issued in reliance
upon one or more exemptions from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and any applicable state securities Laws, (ii) have not been

securities Laws and, therefore, must be held indefinitely and cannot be resold

pursuant to such Seller's Lock-Up Agreement; (d) is aware that an

reason of such Seller's business or financial experience, or by reason of
the business or financial experience of such Seller's "purchaser
representatives" (as that term is defined in Rule 501(h) under the Securities
Act), each Seller is capable of evaluating the risks and merits of an
investment in Pubco and of protecting its interests in connection with this
investment. Each Seller has carefully read and understands all materials
provided by or on behalf of Pubco, Purchaser or their respective
Representatives to such Seller or such Seller's Representatives pertaining to
an investment in Pubco and has consulted, as such Seller has deemed advisable,
with its own attorneys, accountants or investment advisors with respect to
the investment contemplated hereby and its suitability for such Seller. Each
Seller acknowledges that the Consideration Shares are subject to dilution for
events not under the control of such Seller. Each Seller has completed
its independent inquiry and has relied fully upon the advice of its own legal
counsel, accountant, financial and other Representatives in determining the
legal, tax, financial and other consequences of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and the suitability of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby for such Seller and its particular
circumstances, and, except as set forth herein, has not relied upon any
representations or advice by Pubco, Purchaser or their respective
Representatives. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that, except as set
forth in _Article IV_ (including the related portions of the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedules) and _Article V_ , no representations or
warranties have been made by Pubco, Purchaser or any of their respective
Representatives, and that such Seller has not been guaranteed or represented
to by any Person, (i) any specific amount or the event of the distribution of
any cash, property or other interest in Pubco or (ii) the profitability or
value of the Consideration Shares in any manner whatsoever. Each Seller: (A)
has been represented by independent counsel (or has had the opportunity to
consult with independent counsel and has declined to do so); (B) has had the
full right and opportunity to consult with such Seller's attorneys and other
advisors and has availed itself of this right and opportunity; (C) has
carefully read and fully understands this Agreement in its entirety and has
had it fully explained to it or him by such counsel; (D) is fully aware of the
contents hereof and the meaning, intent and legal effect thereof; and (E) is

behalf of any Seller.

applicable Laws and regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the receipt of all applicable Consents of
Governmental Authorities) and to comply as promptly as practicable with all
requirements of Governmental Authorities applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 8.9(a)_ , to the extent
required under any Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(" _Antitrust Laws_ "), each Party hereto agrees to make any required filing
or application under Antitrust Laws, as applicable, at such Party's sole cost
and expense, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly
as practicable, to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be reasonably
requested pursuant to Antitrust Laws and to take all other actions reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable,
including by requesting early termination of the waiting period provided for
under the Antitrust Laws. Each Party shall, in connection with its efforts to
obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) cooperate in all respects with each other Party or
its Affiliates in connection with any filing or submission and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated
by a private Person; (ii) keep the other Parties reasonably informed of any

Representatives of the other Parties the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences; (iv) in the event a
Party's Representative is prohibited from participating in or attending any
meetings or conferences, the other Parties shall keep such Party promptly and
reasonably apprised with respect thereto; and (v) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate in the filing of any memoranda, white papers, filings,
correspondence or other written communications explaining or defending the
transactions contemplated hereby, articulating any regulatory or competitive
argument, and/or responding to requests or objections made by
any Governmental Authority.

  



  

   

47

 



    



  

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Parties shall cooperate in all material respects with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use) their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with Governmental
Authorities requests for approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to have such
Governmental Authorities approve the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Purchaser and Pubco, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall give prompt written notice to the other if such Party
or its Representatives (or, with respect to the Company, any Seller) receives
any notice from such Governmental Authorities in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall promptly furnish the
other with a copy of such Governmental Authority notice. If any Governmental
Authority requires that a hearing or meeting be held in connection with its
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether prior to the
Closing or after the Closing, each of Pubco, the Purchaser and the
Company shall arrange for Representatives of such Party to be present for
such hearing or meeting. If any objections are asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any applicable Law or if any
Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by any applicable
Governmental Authority or any private Person challenging any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Document as
violative of any applicable Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve any such objections or Actions so as to timely permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents, including in order to resolve such objections or Actions
which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. In the event any Action is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority or private Person
challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any Ancillary
Document, the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives
to, cooperate in all material respects with each other and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such
Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Closing, each Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any Consents of Governmental Authorities or other third
Persons as may be necessary for the consummation by such Party or its
Affiliates of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or required as
a result of the execution or performance of, or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement by such Party or its Affiliates,
and the other Parties shall provide reasonable cooperation in connection with
such efforts.

  



  

8.10 _Further Assurances_. The Parties hereto shall further cooperate with
each other and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take
or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on their part under this Agreement
and applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable, including preparing and filing

8.11 _The Registration Statement_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Purchaser and Pubco
shall prepare with the reasonable assistance of the Company, and file with
the SEC a registration statement on Form F-4 (as amended or supplemented from
time to time, and including the Proxy Statement contained therein, the "
_Registration Statement_ ") in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the Pubco Securities to be issued under this Agreement to
the holders of Purchaser Securities prior to the Effective Time, which
Registration Statement will also contain a proxy statement of Purchaser (as
amended, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") for the purpose of soliciting proxies
from Purchaser shareholders for the matters to be acted upon at the Special
Meeting and providing the Public Stockholders an opportunity in accordance
with Purchaser's Organizational Documents and the IPO Prospectus to have
their Purchaser Class A Common Stock (or if after the Effective Time, their
Pubco Ordinary Shares) redeemed (the " _Redemption_ ") in conjunction with
the stockholder vote on the Purchaser Shareholder Approval Matters. The Proxy
Statement shall include proxy materials for the purpose of soliciting proxies
from Purchaser shareholders to vote, at an extraordinary general meeting of
Purchaser stockholders to be called and held for such purpose (the "
_Special Meeting_ "), in favor of resolutions approving (i) the adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the Transactions (including, to the extent
required, the issuance of any PIPE Shares) by the holders of Purchaser Common
Shares in accordance with the Purchaser's Organizational Documents, the DCGL
and the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, (ii) the adoption and
approval of three equity incentive plans for Pubco in substantially the forms
attached as _Exhibit E_ hereto (collectively, the " _Pubco Equity Plans_ "):
(A) one of which (the " _Assumed Plan_ ") will cover the Assumed Options and
provide that the Assumed Options continue to be subject to the same terms as
the Company Equity Plan, as adjusted in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ for
the revised terms of the Assumed Options, (B) another of which (the "
_Management Performance Plan_ ") will provide for up to a total of 1,500,000
Pubco Ordinary Shares (as equitably adjusted for share splits, share
dividends, combinations, recapitalizations and the like after the Closing)
(the " _Management Earnout Shares_ ") to be issued to participating
management of Pubco and its Subsidiaries if Pubco attains certain consolidated
revenue and stock price targets in the calendar years 2019 and 2020, and (C)
the last of which (the " _Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan_ ") will cover any
other future equity incentive grants made by Pubco after the Closing Date
(other than the Assumed Options or the Management Earnout Shares), and will
provide that the total awards under the Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Assumed Options and the Management
Earnout Shares) will be for a number of Pubco Ordinary Shares equal to
ten percent (10%) of the aggregate number of Pubco Ordinary Shares issued and
outstanding immediately after the Closing, (iii) the appointment, and
designation of classes, of the members of the Post-Closing Pubco Board, in
each case in accordance with _Section 8.15_ hereof, (iv) such other matters
as the Company and Purchaser shall hereafter mutually determine to be
necessary or appropriate in order to effect the Transactions (the approvals
described in foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), collectively, the "
_Purchaser Shareholder Approval Matters_ "), and (v) the adjournment of the
Special Meeting, if necessary or desirable in the reasonable determination of
Purchaser. If on the date for which the Special Meeting is scheduled,
Purchaser has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
to obtain the Required Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is
present, Purchaser may make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Special Meeting. In connection with the Registration
Statement, Purchaser and Pubco will file with the SEC financial and other
information about the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with applicable Law and applicable proxy solicitation and
registration statement rules set forth in the Purchaser's Organizational
Documents, the Delaware Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC and
Nasdaq. Purchaser and Pubco shall cooperate and provide the Company (and its
counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto prior to
filing the same with the SEC. The Company shall provide Purchaser and Pubco
with such information concerning the Target Companies and their stockholders,
officers, directors, employees, assets, Liabilities, condition (financial or
otherwise), business and operations that may be required or appropriate for
inclusion in the Registration Statement, or in any amendments or supplements
thereto, which information provided by the Company shall be true and correct
and not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading.

  



  

(b) Purchaser and Pubco shall take any and all reasonable and necessary
actions required to satisfy the requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws in connection with the
Registration Statement, the Special Meeting and the Redemption. Each of
Purchaser, Pubco and the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, make their respective directors, officers and employees,
upon reasonable advance notice, available to the Company, Pubco, Purchaser
and, after the Closing, the Purchaser Representative and their respective
Representatives in connection with the drafting of the public filings with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Registration Statement, and responding in a timely manner to comments from the
SEC. Each Party shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Registration Statement (and other related materials) if and to the
extent that such information is determined to have become false or misleading
in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Laws.
Purchaser and Pubco shall amend or supplement the Registration Statement and
cause the Registration Statement, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed
with the SEC and to be disseminated to Purchaser's stockholders, in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable Laws and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and Purchaser's Organizational Documents.

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

(c) Purchaser and Pubco, with the assistance of the other Parties, shall
promptly respond to any SEC comments on the Registration Statement and shall
otherwise use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to "clear" comments from the SEC and become effective. Purchaser
and Pubco shall provide the Company with copies of any written comments, and
shall inform the Company of any material oral comments, that Purchaser, Pubco
or their respective Representatives receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Registration Statement, the Special Meeting and the Redemption
promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall give the Company a
reasonable opportunity under the circumstances to review and comment on any
proposed written or material oral responses to such comments.

  



  

(d) As soon as practicable following the Registration Statement "clearing"
comments from the SEC and becoming effective, Purchaser and Pubco shall
distribute the Registration Statement to Purchaser's shareholders and,
pursuant thereto, shall call the Special Meeting in accordance with the
Delaware Act for a date no later than thirty (30) days following the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement.

  



  

(e) Purchaser and Pubco shall comply with all applicable Laws, any applicable
rules and regulations of Nasdaq, Purchaser's Organizational Documents and
this Agreement in the preparation, filing and distribution of the Registration
Statement, any solicitation of proxies thereunder, the calling and holding of
the Special Meeting and the Redemption.

(a) The Parties agree that no public release, filing or announcement
concerning this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be issued by any Party or
any of their Affiliates without the prior written consent (not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of Purchaser, Pubco, the
Company and, after the Closing, the Purchaser Representative, except as such
release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the applicable Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow Purchaser, Pubco, the
Company and, after the Closing, the Purchaser Representative reasonable time
to comment on, and arrange for any required filing with respect to,
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

  



  

   

50

Promptly after the issuance of the Signing Press Release, Purchaser shall file
a current report on Form 8-K (the " _Signing Filing_ ") with the Signing
Press Release and a description of this Agreement as required by Federal
Securities Laws, which the Company shall review, comment upon and approve
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
prior to filing (with the Company reviewing, commenting upon and approving
such Signing Filing in any event no later than the third (3rd) Business Day
after the execution of this Agreement). Pubco and the

notice or application made by or on behalf of a Party to any Governmental
Authority or other third party in connection with the transactions

a Governmental Authority or otherwise required to be disclosed pursuant to
applicable Law shall not be disclosed without the consent of such Seller, not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

the extent legally permitted with prompt written notice of such requirement so
that the Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof may seek, at Purchaser's cost, a

8.13(a), and (B) in the event that such protective Order or other remedy is
not obtained, or Purchaser waives compliance with this _Section 8.13(a)_
, furnish only that portion of such Purchaser Confidential Information which
is legally required to be provided as advised by outside counsel and to
exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that
confidential treatment will be accorded such Purchaser Confidential
Information. In the event that this Agreement is terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, the Company and the

event that such protective Order or other remedy is not obtained, or the
Company waives compliance with this _Section 8.13(b)_ , furnish only that

Companies in existence on the Closing Date and make the same available for
inspection and copying by the Purchaser Representative during normal business
hours of Pubco and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, upon reasonable request
and upon reasonable notice. No such books, records or documents shall be

52

 



    



  

8.15 _Post-Closing Board of Directors and Executive Officers_.

  



  

(a) The Parties shall take all necessary action, including causing the
directors of the Pubco to resign, so that effective as of the
Closing, Pubco's board of directors (the " _Post-Closing Pubco Board_ ") will
consist of five (5) individuals. Immediately after the Closing, the Parties
shall take all necessary action to designate and appoint to the Post-Closing
Pubco Board (i) the two (2) persons that are designated by Purchaser prior to
the Closing (the " _Purchaser Directors_ "), at least one of whom shall
qualify as an independent director under Nasdaq rules and (ii) the three (3)
persons that are designated by the Company prior to the Closing (the "
_Company Directors_ "), at least two (2) of whom shall be required to qualify
as an independent director under Nasdaq rules. Pursuant to the Amended Pubco
Charter as in effect as of the Closing, the Post-Closing Pubco Board will be
a classified board with three classes of directors, with (I) one class of
directors, the Class I Directors, initially serving a one (1) year term, such
term effective from the Closing (but any subsequent Class I Directors serving
a three (3) year term), (II) a second class of directors, the Class II
Directors, initially serving a two (2) year term, such term effective from
the Closing (but any subsequent Class II Directors serving a three (3) year
term), and (III) a third class of directors, the Class III Directors, serving
a three (3) year term, such term effective from the Closing. One (1) Company
Director and one (1) Purchaser Director shall be Class III Directors, and the
other Purchaser Director shall be a Class II Director. In accordance with the
Amended Pubco Charter as in effect at the Closing, no director on the Post-
Closing Pubco Board may be removed without cause. At or prior to the Closing,
Pubco will provide each Purchaser Director with a customary director
indemnification agreement, in form and substance reasonable acceptable to
such Purchaser Director.

  



  

(b) The Parties shall take all action necessary, including causing the
executive officers of Pubco to resign, so that the individuals serving as the
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively, of Pubco
immediately after the Closing will be the same individuals (in the same
office) as that of the Company immediately prior to the Closing (unless, at
its sole discretion, the Company desires to appoint another qualified person
to either such role, in which case, such other person identified by the
Company shall serve in such role).

  



  

8.16 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Tail Insurance_.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses existing in favor of the current or former directors
and officers of Purchaser, Pubco or Merger Sub and each Person who served as a
director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise at the request of Purchaser, Pubco or Merger Sub (the " _D andO
Indemnified Persons_") as provided in their respective Organizational
Documents or under any indemnification, employment or other similar agreements
between any DandO Indemnified Person and Purchaser, Pubco or Merger Sub, in
each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the
Closing and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms to the extent permitted by applicable Law. For a period of
six (6) years after the Effective Time, Pubco shall cause the Organizational
Documents of Pubco and Purchaser to contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to exculpation and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to
DandO Indemnified Persons than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement
in the Organizational Documents of Purchaser, Pubco and Merger Sub to the
extent permitted by applicable Law. The provisions of this _Section 8.16_
shall survive the Closing and are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Persons and their
respective heirs and representatives.

  



  

(b) For the benefit of the Purchaser's, Pubco's and Merger Sub's directors
and officers, Purchaser shall be permitted prior to the Effective Time to
obtain and fully pay the premium for a "tail" insurance policy that provides
coverage for up to a six-year period from and after the Effective Time for
events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Tail Insurance_")
that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than Purchaser's existing policy or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage. If obtained,
Pubco and Purchaser shall maintain the DandO Tail Insurance in full force and
effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder, and Pubco and
Purchaser shall timely pay all premiums with respect to the DandO Tail
Insurance.

  



  

   

53

 



    



  

8.17 _Trust Account Proceeds_. The Parties agree that after the Closing, the
funds in the Trust Account, after taking into account payments for the
Redemption, and any proceeds received by Pubco from any PIPE Investment shall
first be used (i) to pay Purchaser's and Pubco's accrued Expenses, (ii) to
pay Purchaser's deferred Expenses (including cash amounts payable to EBC
and any legal fees) of the IPO and (iii) to pay any loans owed by Purchaser
or Pubco to Sponsor for Expenses (including deferred Expenses), other
administrative costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of Purchaser or
Pubco or Extension Expenses. Such amounts, as well as any Expenses that are
required or permitted to be paid by delivery of Pubco Securities, will be paid
at the Closing. Promptly (and in any event within two (2) weeks) after the
Closing, any remaining cash at Pubco will be distributed to a Target
Company and used for working capital and general corporate purposes.

  



  

8.18 _PIPE Investment_. Without limiting anything to the contrary contained
herein, during the Interim Period, Pubco may enter into and consummate
subscription agreements with investors relating to a private equity investment
in Pubco to purchase shares of Pubco (" _PIPE Shares_ ") in connection with a
private placement, and/or enter into backstop arrangements with potential
investors, in either case on terms mutually agreeable to the Company,
Purchaser and Pubco, acting reasonably (a " _PIPE Investment_ "), and, if
Pubco elects to seek a PIPE Investment, Pubco, Purchaser and the Company
shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, cooperate with
each other and their respective Representatives in connection with such
PIPE Investment and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such PIPE Investment to occur (including having the Company's senior
management participate in any investor meetings and roadshows as requested by
Purchaser or Pubco).

their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, successors and

Pro Rata Shares, and any offsets against issuances of Holdback Shares to
satisfy such indemnification obligations shall be allocated among all of the
Sellers based on their respective Pro Rata Shares. Indemnification obligations
of a Seller for a claim under _Section 9.2(b)_ shall be fully borne by the
breaching Seller and shall not be allocated to the other Sellers, and any
issuances of Holdback Shares to the Sellers in accordance with this Agreement
shall be adjusted to deduct from such distributions the obligations owed on
behalf of such breaching Seller.

  



  

9.3 _Limitations and General Indemnification Provisions_.

  



  

(a) The maximum aggregate amount of indemnification payments to which the
Indemnitors will be obligated to pay in the aggregate under _Section 9.2_
shall not exceed an amount equal to the value of the Holdback Shares in
accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

(b) For purposes of determining the amount of Losses with respect to any
indemnification claim (but not for purposes of determining whether there has
been a breach giving rise to the indemnification claim), all of the
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement
(including the disclosure schedules hereto) or any Ancillary Document that are
qualified by materiality, Material Adverse Effect or words of similar import
or effect will be deemed to have been made without any such qualification.

  



  

(c) No investigation or knowledge by an Indemnitee, Purchaser, Pubco or the
Purchaser Representative, or their respective Representatives, of a breach of
a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Pubco, the Company, the
Sellers or any Indemnitor shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the Company or the Sellers or the recourse
available to an Indemnitee under any provision of this Agreement, including
this _Article IX_ , with respect thereto.

  



  

(d) The amount of any Losses suffered or incurred by any Indemnitee shall be
reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds paid to the Indemnitee or any
Affiliate thereof as a reimbursement with respect to such Losses (and no right
of subrogation shall accrue to any insurer hereunder, except to the extent
that such waiver of subrogation would prejudice any applicable insurance
coverage), net of the costs of collection and the increases in insurance
premiums resulting from such Loss or insurance payment.

  



  

9.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

  



  

(a) The Purchaser Representative shall have the sole right to act on behalf
of the Indemnitees with respect to any indemnification claims made pursuant
to this _Article IX_ , including bringing and settling any indemnification
claims hereunder and receiving any notices on behalf of the Indemnitees.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Parties,
including each of the Sellers, hereby agree that the Company shall have the
sole right to act on behalf of the Indemnitors with respect to any
indemnification claims made pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ , including
defending and settling any indemnification claims hereunder and receiving any
notices on behalf of the Indemnitors, including enforcing any rights of the
Indemnitors under _Section 9.4(c)_ with respect to Third Party Claims or
under _Section 9.4(d)_ with respect to claims that are not Third Party Claims
(and any references to the rights of the Indemnitor thereunder with respect
to such claims shall instead be a right of the Company), and the
Indemnitors, by executing and delivering this Agreement, hereby agree that
they shall be bound by any decisions, acts or omissions of the Company with
respect thereto. The Indemnitors hereby acknowledge and agree that they shall
only be entitled to act on their own behalf with respect to indemnification
claims made pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_.

  



  

   

56

 



    



  

(b) In order to make a claim for indemnification hereunder, the Purchaser
Representative on behalf of an Indemnitee must provide written notice (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") of such claim to the Indemnitor (or, with respect to a claim
under _Section 9.2(a)_ , the Company), which Claim Notice shall include (i) a
reasonable description of the facts and circumstances which relate to the
subject matter of such indemnification claim to the extent then known and (ii)
the amount of Losses suffered by the Indemnitee in connection with the claim
to the extent known or reasonably estimable (provided, that the Purchaser
Representative may thereafter in good faith adjust the amount of Losses with
respect to the claim by providing a revised Claim Notice to the Indemnitor
(or, with respect to a claim under _Section 9.2(a)_ , the Company).

  



  

(c) In the case of any claim for indemnification under this _Article IX_
arising from a claim of a third party (including any Governmental Authority)
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Purchaser Representative must give a Claim
Notice with respect to such Third Party Claim to the Indemnitor promptly (but
in no event later than thirty (30) days) after the Indemnitee's receipt of
notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that the failure to give such
notice will not relieve the Indemnitor of its indemnification obligations
except to the extent that the defense of such Third Party Claim is materially
and irrevocably prejudiced by the failure to give such notice. The Indemnitor
will have the right to defend and to direct the defense against any such
Third Party Claim, in its name and at its expense and with counsel selected by
the Indemnitor, unless (i) the Indemnitor fails to acknowledge fully to the
Purchaser Representative the obligations of the Indemnitor to the Indemnitee
within twenty (20) days after receiving notice of such Third Party Claim or
contests, in whole or in part, its indemnification obligations therefor
or (ii) at any time while such Third Party Claim is pending, (A) there is a
conflict of interest between the Indemnitor and the Purchaser Representative
on behalf of the Indemnitee in the conduct of such defense, (B) the applicable
third party alleges a Fraud Claim, (C) such claim is criminal in nature,
could reasonably be expected to lead to criminal proceedings, or seeks an
injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnitee or (D) the amount
of the Third Party Claim exceeds or is reasonably expected to exceed the
value of the remaining Holdback Shares (after deducting any amounts for
pending but unresolved indemnification claims and resolved but unsatisfied
indemnification claims). If the Indemnitor elects, and is entitled, to
compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, it will within twenty (20) days
(or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) notify the
Purchaser Representative of its intent to do so, and the Purchaser
Representative and the Indemnitee will, at the request and expense of the
Indemnitor, cooperate in the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnitor elects not to, or at any time is not entitled under this  _Section
9.4_ to, compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to notify the
Purchaser Representative of its election as herein provided or refuses to
acknowledge or contests its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the
Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee may pay, compromise or
defend such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Indemnitor will have no indemnification obligations
with respect to any such Third Party Claim which is settled by the Indemnitee
or the Purchaser Representative without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned); _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnitee will not be required to refrain from paying any Third Party Claim
which has matured by a final, non-appealable Order, nor will it be
required to refrain from paying any Third Party Claim where the delay in
paying such claim would result in the foreclosure of a Lien upon any of the
property or assets then held by the Indemnitee or where any delay in payment
would cause the Indemnitee material economic loss. The Indemnitor's right to
direct the defense will include the right to compromise or enter into an
agreement settling any Third Party Claim; provided, that no such compromise
or settlement will obligate the Indemnitee to agree to any settlement that
that requires the taking or restriction of any action (including the payment
of money and competition restrictions) by the Indemnitee other than the
execution of a release for such Third Party Claim and/or agreeing to be
subject to customary confidentiality obligations in connection therewith,
except with the prior written consent of the Purchaser Representative on
behalf of the Indemnitee (such consent to be withheld, conditioned or delayed
only for a good faith reason). Notwithstanding the Indemnitor's right to
compromise or settle in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence,
the Indemnitor may not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim over the
objection of the Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee;
_provided_ , _however_ , that consent by the Purchaser Representative on
behalf of the Indemnitee to settlement or compromise will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Purchaser Representative on behalf of
the Indemnitee will have the right to participate in the defense of any Third
Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnitor's right to
direct the defense.

  



  

   

57

 



    



  

(d) With respect to any direct indemnification claim that is not a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnitor will have a period of thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Claim Notice to respond thereto. If the Indemnitor does not
respond within such thirty (30) days, the Indemnitor will be deemed to have
accepted responsibility for the Losses set forth in such Claim Notice subject
to the limitations on indemnification set forth in this _Article IX_ and will
have no further right to contest the validity of such Claim Notice. If the
Indemnitor responds within such thirty (30) days and rejects such claim in
whole or in part, the Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee
will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available under this Agreement
(subject to _Section 13.4_ ), any Ancillary Documents or applicable Law.

  



  

9.5 _Indemnification Payments_. Any indemnification obligation of an
Indemnitor under this _Article IX_ will be satisfied promptly, but in
any event within five (5) Business Days, after the determination of such
obligation in accordance with _Section 9.4_. Any indemnification claims
against the Indemnitors shall be satisfied by offsetting the amount of such
indemnification obligations against the Holdback Shares. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, any indemnification payments will
be made to Pubco or its successors, by the offset of such Holdback Shares.
With respect to the satisfaction of any indemnification obligation, the value
of each Holdback Share or any other Pubco Ordinary Shares for purposes of
determining the satisfaction of the indemnification obligation shall be the
Pubco Share Price on the date that the indemnification claim is finally
determined in accordance with this _Article IX_. Without limiting any of the
foregoing or any other rights of the Indemnitees under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document or at law or equity, in the event that an Indemnitor fails
or refuses to promptly indemnify an Indemnitee as provided herein or
otherwise fails or refuses to make any payments required under any Ancillary
Document, in either case, where it is established that such Indemnitor is
obligated to provide such indemnification or to make such payment, the
applicable Indemnitee shall, in its sole discretion, be entitled to claim a
portion of the Pubco Ordinary Shares then owned by such Indemnitor up to an
amount equal in value (based on the then current Pubco Share Price) to the
amount owed by such Indemnitor. In the event that such Indemnitor fails to
promptly transfer any such Pubco Ordinary Shares pursuant to this _Section
9.5_ , the Purchaser Representative on behalf of Pubco shall be and hereby is
authorized as the attorney-in-fact for such Indemnitor to transfer such Pubco
Ordinary Shares to the proper recipient thereof as required by this _Section
9.5_ and may transfer such Pubco Ordinary Shares and cancel the stock
certificates for such Pubco Ordinary Shares on the books and records of Pubco
and issue new stock certificates to such transferee and may instruct its
agents and any exchanges on which Pubco Ordinary Shares are listed or traded
to do the same.

  



  

9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, except with respect to
Fraud Claims relating to the Company or any Seller or claims
seeking injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief
(including pursuant to _Section 13.7_ ), or claims under the terms of the
Ancillary Documents, indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy for the Parties with respect to matters arising
under this Agreement of any kind or nature, including for any
misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant, or other provision
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement, including the negotiation and discussion thereof.

waived by December 19, 2018 (the " _Outside Date_ "); provided, however, that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 11.1(b)_ shall not
be available to a Party if the breach or violation by such Party or its

representation, warranty, covenant or obligation under this Agreement was the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
Outside Date;

prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order
or other action has become final and non-appealable; provided, however, that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.1(c)_

Affiliates (or with respect to the Company, the Sellers) to comply with any
provision of this Agreement has been a substantial cause of, or substantially

(d) by written notice by the Company to Purchaser and Pubco, if (i) there has
been a material breach by Purchaser, Pubco or Merger Sub of any of their
respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Purchaser or Pubco
shall have become materially untrue or materially inaccurate, in any case,
which would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 10.2(a)_
or _Section 10.2(b)_ to be satisfied (treating the Closing Date for such
purposes as the date of this Agreement or, if later, the date of such breach),
and (ii) the breach or inaccuracy is incapable of being cured or is not cured
within the earlier of (A) twenty (20) days after written notice of such breach
or inaccuracy is provided by the Company or (B) the Outside Date; provided,
that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.1(d)_ if at such time the Company or
any Seller is in material uncured breach of this Agreement;

satisfied (treating the Closing Date for such purposes as the date of
this Agreement or, if later, the date of such breach), and (ii) the breach or
inaccuracy is incapable of being cured or is not cured within the earlier of
(A) twenty (20) days after written notice of such breach or inaccuracy is
provided by Purchaser or Pubco or (B) the Outside Date; provided, that

of this Agreement which is uncured and continuing;

  



  

(g) by written notice by either Purchaser or the Company to the other if the

(h) by written notice executed by Sellers holding in the aggregate a Pro Rata
Share of at least 50.1% provided to both Purchaser and the Company if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to June 30, 2019; provided, that
such Sellers shall not be entitled to terminate under this _Section 11.1(h)_
if the breach of violation by any such terminating Sellers of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation under this Agreement was the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
June 30, 2019.

  



  

11.2 _Effect of Termination_. This Agreement may only be terminated in the
circumstances described in _Section 11.1_ and pursuant to a written notice
delivered by the applicable Party to the other applicable Parties, which sets
forth the basis for such termination, including the provision of _Section
11.1_ under which such termination is made. In the event of the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1_ , this Agreement
shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no Liability on the part of
any Party or any of their respective Representatives, and all rights and
obligations of each Party shall cease, except: (i)  _Sections 8.12_, _8.13_
, _11.3_ , _12.1_ , _Article XIII_ and this _Section 11.2_ shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any Party
from Liability for any willful breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation under this Agreement or any Fraud Claim against such
Party, in either case, prior to termination of this Agreement (in each case
of clauses (i) and (ii) above, subject to _Section 12.1_ ). Without
limiting the foregoing, and except as provided in _Sections 11.3_ and this
_Section 11.2_ (but subject to _Section 12.1_ , and subject to the right to
seek injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief in accordance
with _Section 13.7_ ), the Parties' sole right prior to the Closing with
respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained in this Agreement by another Party or with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be the right, if
applicable, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1_.

  



  

   

64

 



    



  

11.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to _Sections 12.1_ and _13.14_ , all
Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses. As
used in this Agreement, " _Expenses_ " shall include all out-of-pocket
expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, financial advisors, financing sources, experts and consultants to a
Party hereto or any of its Affiliates) incurred by a Party or on its behalf
in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document related
hereto and all other matters related to the consummation of this Agreement.
With respect to Purchaser, Expenses shall include any and all deferred
expenses (including fees or commissions payable to the underwriters and any
legal fees) of the IPO upon consummation of a Business Combination, as well
as any costs and expenses incurred in connection with any PIPE Investment or
any Extension.

  



  

Article XII _ 
 WAIVERS AND RELEASES_

  



  

12.1 _Waiver of Claims Against Trust_. Reference is made to the IPO
Prospectus. The Company and each Seller hereby acknowledges that it has read
the IPO Prospectus and understands that Purchaser has established the Trust
Account containing the proceeds of the IPO and the overallotment shares
acquired by Purchaser's underwriters (including interest accrued from time to
time thereon) for the benefit of Purchaser's public stockholders (including
overallotment shares acquired by Purchaser's underwriters) (including any
successors after the Merger, the " _Public Stockholders_ ") and that, except
as otherwise described in the IPO Prospectus, Purchaser may disburse monies
from the Trust Account only: (a) to the Public Stockholders in the event they
elect to redeem their shares of Purchaser Class A Common Stock (or Pubco
Ordinary Shares upon the Merger) in connection with the consummation of its
initial business combination (as such term is used in the IPO Prospectus) ("
_Business Combination_ ") or in connection with an amendment to Purchaser's
Organizational documents to extend Purchaser's deadline to consummate a
Business Combination, (b) to the Public Stockholders if the Purchaser fails to
consummate a Business Combination within twelve (12) months (or up to twenty
(21) months if extended pursuant to the terms of the Purchaser Charter) after
the closing of the IPO, (c) with respect to any interest earned on the
amounts held in the Trust Account, as necessary to pay any franchise or income
taxes or for any liquidation expenses, and (d) to Purchaser after or
concurrently with the consummation of a Business Combination. For and in
consideration of Purchaser entering into this Agreement and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the Company and each Seller hereby agrees on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of the Company, any Seller nor any of their respective
Affiliates do now or shall at any time hereafter have any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account or
distributions therefrom, or make any claim against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such
claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to,
this Agreement or any proposed or actual business relationship between
Purchaser, Pubco or any of their respective Representatives, on the one hand,
and the Company, any Seller or their respective Representatives, on the other
hand, or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based
on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all
such claims are collectively referred to hereafter as the " _Released Claims_
"). The Company and each Seller on behalf of itself and its Affiliates hereby
irrevocably waives any Released Claims that the Company, any Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates may have against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a result of, or arising out
of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Purchaser, Pubco or their
respective Representatives and will not seek recourse against the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever
(including for an alleged breach of this Agreement or any other agreement with
Purchaser, Pubco or their respective Affiliates). The Company and each Seller
each agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to
this Agreement and specifically relied upon by Purchaser, Pubco and their
respective Affiliates to induce Purchaser, Pubco and Merger Sub to enter in
this Agreement, and the Company and each Seller further intends and
understands such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against the
Company, each Seller and each of their respective Affiliates under applicable
Law. To the extent the Company, any Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates commences any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with,
relating to or arising out of any matter relating to Purchaser, Pubco or
their respective Representatives, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in
part, monetary relief against Purchaser, Pubco or their respective
Representatives, the Company and each Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees
that their and their Affiliates' sole remedy shall be against funds held
outside of the Trust Account and that such claim shall not permit any the
Company, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (or any Person
claiming on any of their behalves or in lieu of them) to have any claim
against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) or any
amounts contained therein. In the event that the Company, any Seller or any
of their respective Affiliates commences Action based upon, in connection
with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to Purchaser, Pubco or
their respective Representatives which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part,
relief against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) or
the Public Stockholders, whether in the form of money damages or injunctive
relief, Purchaser, Pubco and their respective Representatives, as
applicable, shall be entitled to recover from the Company, the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates, as applicable, the associated legal fees and
costs in connection with any such Action, in the event Purchaser, Pubco or
their respective Representatives, as applicable, prevails in such Action.
This _Section 12.1_ shall survive termination of this Agreement for any
reason.

  



  

12.2 _Release and Covenant Not to Sue_. Effective as of the Closing, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Seller, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates that owns any share or other equity interest in or of such
Seller (the " _Releasing Persons_ "), hereby releases and discharges the
Target Companies from and against any and all Actions, obligations,
agreements, debts and Liabilities whatsoever, whether known or unknown, both
at law and in equity, which such Releasing Person now has, has ever had or may
hereafter have against the Target Companies arising on or prior to the
Closing Date or on account of or arising out of any matter occurring on or
prior to the Closing Date, including any rights to indemnification or
reimbursement from a Target Company, whether pursuant to its Organizational
Documents, Contract or otherwise, and whether or not relating to claims
pending on, or asserted after, the Closing Date. From and after the Closing,
each Releasing Person hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly
or indirectly, asserting any Action, or commencing or causing to be
commenced, any Action of any kind against the Target Companies or their
respective Affiliates, based upon any matter purported to be released hereby.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the releases and
restrictions set forth herein shall not apply to any claims a Releasing Person
may have against any party pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document or any of the other matters set forth on
_Schedule 12.2_.

13.2 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement shall
not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, Pubco, the Company and the Purchaser Representative, and
any assignment without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ that
no such assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of its
obligations hereunder.

  



  

13.3 _Third Parties_. Except for the rights of the DandO Indemnified Persons
set forth in _Section 8.16_ , which the Parties acknowledge and agree are
express third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Agreement or in any instrument or document executed by any party in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall create any rights
in, or be deemed to have been executed for the benefit of, any Person that is
not a Party hereto or thereto or a successor or permitted assign of such a
Party.

  



  

13.4 _Arbitration_. Any and all disputes, controversies and claims (other
than applications for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
injunction, permanent injunction or other equitable relief or application for
enforcement of a resolution under this _Section 13.4_ ) arising out of,
related to, or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (a " _Dispute_ ") shall be governed by this _Section
13.4_. A Party must, in the first instance, provide written notice of any
Disputes to the other Parties subject to such Dispute, which notice must
provide a reasonably detailed description of the matters subject to
the Dispute. The Parties involved in such Dispute shall seek to resolve the
Dispute on an amicable basis within ten (10) Business Days of the notice of
such Dispute being received by such other Parties subject to such Dispute (the
" _Resolution Period_ ");  _provided_ , that if any Dispute would reasonably
be expected to have become moot or otherwise irrelevant if not decided
within sixty (60) days after the occurrence of such Dispute, then there shall
be no Resolution Period with respect to such Dispute. Any Dispute that is not
resolved during the Resolution Period may immediately be referred to and
finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to the then-existing Expedited
Procedures (as defined in the AAA Procedures) of the Commercial Arbitration
Rules (the " _AAA Procedures_ ") of the AAA. Any Party involved in such
Dispute may submit the Dispute to the AAA to commence the proceedings after
the Resolution Period. To the extent that the AAA Procedures and this
Agreement are in conflict, the terms of this Agreement shall control. The
arbitration shall be conducted by one arbitrator nominated by the AAA promptly
(but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the submission of the
Dispute to the AAA and reasonably acceptable to each Party subject to the
Dispute, which arbitrator shall be a commercial lawyer with substantial
experience arbitrating disputes under acquisition agreements. The arbitrator
shall accept his or her appointment and begin the arbitration process promptly
(but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after his or her nomination
and acceptance by the Parties subject to the Dispute. The proceedings shall be
streamlined and efficient. The arbitrator shall decide the Dispute in
accordance with the substantive law of the state of New York. Time is of the
essence. Each Party subject to the Dispute shall submit a proposal for
resolution of the Dispute to the arbitrator within twenty (20) days after
confirmation of the appointment of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have
the power to order any Party to do, or to refrain from doing, anything
consistent with this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and applicable Law,
including to perform its contractual obligation(s); provided, that the
arbitrator shall be limited to ordering pursuant to the foregoing power
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall order) the relevant Party (or
Parties, as applicable) to comply with only one or the other of the
proposals. The arbitrator's award shall be in writing and shall include a
reasonable explanation of the arbitrator's reason(s) for selecting one or the
other proposal. The seat of arbitration shall be in New York County, State of
New York. The language of the arbitration shall be English.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

13.5 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York
without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. Subject to _Section
13.4_ , all Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
heard and determined exclusively in any state or federal court located in New
York, New York (or in any appellate court thereof) (the " _Specified Courts_
"). Subject to _Section 13.4_ , each Party hereto hereby (a) submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any Specified Court for the purpose of any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any Party hereto and
(b) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, defense or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or
by any Specified Court. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
any other Action relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, on behalf of itself, or its property, by personal delivery of
copies of such process to such Party at the applicable address set forth in
_Section 13.1_. Nothing in this _Section 13.5_ shall affect the right of any
Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  



  

13.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 13.6_.

  



  

13.7 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that the rights of each
Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
unique, recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by any Party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-
breaching Parties may have not adequate remedy at law, and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed by an applicable Party in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of
Purchaser, Pubco, Merger Sub, the Company and the Purchaser Representative
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or restraining order to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without the requirement to post any bond or other security
or to prove that money damages would be inadequate, this being in addition to
any other right or remedy to which such Party may be entitled under this
Agreement, at law or in equity.

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

13.8 _Severability_. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, such provision shall be
modified or deleted, as to the jurisdiction involved, only to the extent
necessary to render the same valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the validity, legality or
enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any other
jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will substitute
for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a suitable and equitable
provision that carries out, so far as may be valid, legal and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision.

  



  

13.9 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified
only by execution of a written instrument signed by Purchaser, Pubco, the
Company and the Purchaser Representative; provided that (i) any amendment that
imposes additional material liabilities or obligations on the Sellers
requires the prior written consent of Sellers holding in the aggregate a Pro
Rata Share of at least 50.1%, and (ii) no amendment shall affect a Seller in
a manner materially and adversely disproportionate to the other Sellers
without the prior written consent of such Seller.

  



  

13.10 _Waiver_. Each of Purchaser, Pubco, the Company and, after the Closing,
the Purchaser Representative, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (and the
Company on behalf of the Sellers), may in its sole discretion (i) extend the
time for the performance of any obligation or other act of any other Party
here that is not such Party's Affiliate (or, with respect to the Company, not
a Seller), (ii) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties by
any other Party here that is not such Party's Affiliate (or, with respect to
the Company, not a Seller) contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance by any other Party here that is
not such Party's Affiliate (or, with respect to the Company, not a Seller)
with any covenant or condition contained herein. Any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
Party or Parties to be bound thereby (including by the Purchaser
Representative in lieu of such Party to the extent provided in this
Agreement, and provided that the Company may execute such instrument on behalf
of the Sellers). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by a
