oil that was on board at the commencement of the applicable charter, Buyer
will pay Sellers for the difference, valued at the PAPCO Price or the Exxon
Price, as applicable, or (b) if the amount of diesel fuel and lube oil on
board is less than the amount of diesel fuel and lube oil that was on board at
the commencement of the applicable charter, Sellers will pay Buyer for the
difference, valued at the PAPCO Price or the Exxon Price, as applicable. The
payments under this Section 2.05(b) shall be aggregated or netted to determine
the net amount due from Buyer to Sellers or Sellers to Buyer, as the case may
be. Buyer will not pay any amount for diesel fuel and lube oil on board any
Vessels or Chartered Vessels that are subject to time charters on the Closing
Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Escrow Amount shall be deposited by wire transfer of immediately
available funds into an account designated by the Escrow Agent and shall be
held and distributed in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement to
satisfy any and all claims made by Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnitee against
Sellers pursuant to Article IX.

  

  

(d) The Trips in Progress Holdback Amount and the Sugar Holdback Amount shall
be held by Buyer and disbursed or applied as set forth in Section 2.06.

  

  

(e) All payments by Buyer to Sellers shall be made to the appropriate Seller
in accordance with written instructions from all Sellers.

  

  

Section 2.06 Trips in Progress; Contingent Sugar Payment.

  

  

(a) Trips in Progress.

  

  

(i) For each Vessel that is engaged in a trip in progress under a voyage
charter on the Closing Date, the Gross Revenues attributable to that trip,
whether received by a Seller or Buyer and whether received before or after the
Closing, and the Direct Expenses attributable to that trip (excluding any
allocation of general and administrative expenses), whether paid by a Seller
or Buyer and whether paid before or after the Closing, will be allocated to a
Seller and Buyer in proportion to the number of days (or portion thereof) in
the trip for which each party was the owner of the Vessel. The trip time will
be from arrival at the trip load port until arrival at the next load port. If
the Vessel was released from a time charter to perform services for a
different customer, any reimbursement due to the time charterer shall be
included in the Direct Expenses attributable to the trip in progress. For the
purposes of this Section 2.06(a), the terms "Gross Revenue" and "Direct
Expenses" shall mean as follows:

  

  

    

  |  

(A)

  |  

"Gross Revenues" - All revenues attributable to the voyage, including freight,
fuel surcharge, additional port surcharge, demurrage, and reimbursable
expenses such as pilots and assist tugs.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

"Direct Expenses" - All expenses directly attributable to the voyage including
fuel and lube, port costs, dispatch, pilots and assist tugs. Fuel will be
estimated based on running days.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(ii) For each Vessel that is subject to a time charter on the Closing Date,
the Charter Hire attributable to the operation of the Vessel under the time
charter, whether received by a Seller or Buyer and whether received before or
after the Closing, will be allocated to Sellers and Buyer in proportion to the
number of days in the term of the time charter for which each party was the
owner of the Vessel. Fuel costs and expenses that are reimbursed by the
charterer will be paid to the party making the purchase that is being
reimbursed.

  

  

(iii) If there is a net amount due from Sellers to Buyer under this Section
2.06(a) (the "Seller Payment"), the Seller Payment will first reduce the
Trips-in-Progress Holdback. If the Seller Payment equals or exceeds the Trips-
in-Progress Holdback, the Trips-in-Progress Holdback shall be reduced to zero
and the excess, if any, shall be paid by Sellers to Buyer. If the Trips-in-
Progress Holdback exceeds the Seller Payment, the excess shall be paid by
Buyer to Sellers.

  

  

(iv) If there is a net amount due from Buyer to Sellers under this Section
2.06(a), such amount and the Trips-in-Progress Holdback shall be paid by Buyer
to Sellers.

  

  

(v) For purposes of calculations under this Section 2.06(a) only, Sellers will
be considered the owner of the Vessel prior to the Closing Date and Buyer will
be considered the owner of the Vessel on and after the Closing Date. The net
payment due from Sellers to Buyer or from Buyer to Sellers, as the case may
be, under this Section 2.06(a) shall be made within 60 days after the Closing
Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified
in writing by the receiving party. Each party shall have reasonable access to
the books and records of the other in order to verify the revenues received
and expenses incurred with respect to trips in progress and time charters.

  

  

(b) Contingent Sugar Payment.

  

  

(i) (A) If federal legislation is enacted into law prior to the Closing Date
that continues in effect in all material respects for an additional period of
at least two years through the 2014 crop year the provisions of Subtitle D of
the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (the "Sugar Program"), the
Sugar Holdback Amount shall be paid by Buyer to Sellers at Closing and Section
2.06(b)(ii) and (iii) shall be disregarded and have no further effect.

  

  

(B) If such legislation is enacted into law prior to the Closing Date, but
continues the Sugar Program in effect in all material respects for one year
through the 2013 crop year, Buyer shall pay Sellers $5,000,000 of the Sugar
Holdback Amount at Closing, Section 2.06(b)(ii) shall be disregarded and have
no further effect and the remaining portion of the Sugar Holdback Amount shall
be paid in whole or in part as provided in Section 2.06(b)(iii) unless Section
2.06(b)(i)(D) becomes applicable.

  

  

(C) If such legislation is enacted into law after the Closing Date and
continues the Sugar Program in effect in all material respects for one year
through the 2013 crop year, Buyer shall pay Sellers $5,000,000 of the Sugar
Holdback Amount, Section 2.06(b)(ii) shall be disregarded and have no further
effect and the remaining portion of the Sugar Holdback Amount shall be paid in
whole or in part as provided in Section 2.06(b)(iii) unless Section
2.06(b)(i)(D) becomes applicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(D) If such legislation is enacted into law after the Closing Date and
continues the Sugar Program in effect in all material respects through the
2013 and 2014 crop years, Buyer shall pay Sellers the full Sugar Holdback
Amount if no previous payment has been made pursuant to Section 2.06(b)(i)(C)
or pursuant to Section 2.06(b)(ii), or $5,000,000 of the Sugar Holdback Amount
if any such previous payment has been made, and Section 2.06(b)(ii) and (iii)
shall be disregarded and have no further effect.

  

  

(E) Except as provided in this Section 2.06(b)(i), the Sugar Holdback Amount
shall be paid in whole or in part as provided in Section 2.06(b)(ii) and
(iii). Except for the reference to "crop year(s)" in this Section 2.06(b), all
references in this Section 2.06(b) to years are references to calendar years.
Except as provided in this Section 2.06(b)(i), all payments under this Section
2.06(b) shall be made by Buyer to Sellers or otherwise in accordance with
written instructions from Sellers within 30 days after the end of the period
or the date of the legislation, whichever is applicable, on which the
determination of the payment is based.

  

  

(ii) The "Average Annual Volume" means the average annual number of net short
tons of raw sugar (A) transported coastwise domestically by Sellers and Buyer
for Florida Sugar Marketing and Terminal Assn., Inc. (the "Association")
pursuant to the Florida Bulk Sugar Affreightment Agreement, dated October 5,
1989, between Allied Towing Corporation, TMI and the Association, as amended
to date (the "Existing Florida Contract"), (B) if the Existing Florida
Contract expires or is terminated, transported coastwise domestically by any
other transportation company for the Association or its successor corporation,
Florida Sugar and Molasses Exchange, Inc., from the Port of Palm Beach, Florida
to any of the same destinations specified in the Existing Florida Contract,
(C) transported coastwise domestically by Buyer for the Association other than
under the Existing Florida Contract and (D) transported coastwise domestically
by Sellers and Buyer from Louisiana for American Sugar Refining, Inc. and
Louisiana Sugar Cane Products, Inc., in each case during the specified time
period. If the Average Annual Volume during the period 2012-2014 is greater
than or equal to 500,000 net short tons, Buyer shall pay Sellers $5,000,000 of
the Sugar Holdback Amount. If the Average Annual Volume for 2012-2014 is
greater than 300,000 net short tons but less than 500,000 net short tons,
Buyer shall pay Sellers an amount equal to $5,000,000 multiplied by the
Average Annual Volume for 2012-2014 and divided by 500,000. If the Average
Annual Volume for 2012-2014 is less than or equal to 300,000 net short tons,
no payment shall be due from Buyer to Sellers.

  

  

(iii) If the Average Annual Volume during the period 2013-2015 is greater than
or equal to 500,000 net short tons, Buyer shall pay Sellers $5,000,000 of the
Sugar Holdback Amount. If the Average Annual Volume is greater than 300,000
net short tons but less than 500,000 net short tons, Buyer shall pay Sellers
an amount equal to $5,000,000 multiplied by the Average Annual Volume for
2013-2015 and divided by 500,000. If the Average Annual Volume for 2013-2015
is less than or equal to 300,000 net short tons, no payment shall be due from
Buyer to Sellers.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) In the event of a weather-related natural phenomenon, such as a
hurricane, drought or freeze, in any year during the period 2012-2014 that
results in a reduction of the Average Annual Volume during such period below
400,000 net short tons, that year shall be dropped and replaced by the year
2015 in calculating the Average Annual Volume for purposes of Section
2.06(b)(ii). In the event that any such natural phenomenon occurs in any year
during the period 2013-2015 that results in a reduction of the Average Annual
Volume during such period below 400,000 net short tons, that year shall be
dropped in calculating the Average Annual Volume for purposes of Section
2.06(b)(ii), if applicable, and Section 2.06(b)(iii) and the calculation will
instead be based on the remaining two years in the period. In no event shall
the average annual volume for purposes of determining payments under this
Section 2.06(b) be based on a period of less than two years, so that if there
are multiple years in which such natural phenomena occur, the determinations
of Average Annual Volumes and the related payments shall be delayed for
successive years until the determination can be made for at least a two-year
period; provided that the Average Annual Volumes and the related payments
shall in any event be determined based on a period that includes 2014, 2015 or
2016, whichever has the greatest volume, as the second year (regardless of
natural phenomena) if not determined before the end of 2016.

  

  

(v) No payment of any portion of the Sugar Holdback Amount shall be due from
Buyer except as provided in this Section 2.06(b). The Sugar Holdback Amount is
the maximum amount payable under this Section 2.06(b) under any circumstances.
Buyer shall have the right to set off against any payment otherwise due to
Sellers under this Section 2.06(b) the amount of any Losses for which Buyer is
entitled to indemnification under Article IX.

  

  

(vi) Buyer shall have the right to operate the Business after Closing in the
manner it deems appropriate and shall have no obligation to operate the
Business to maximize the payments to Sellers under this Section 2.06(b). Buyer
will have the right to make any business decisions relating to the Business,
including without limitation capital expenditures and pricing of services,
that Buyer in good faith determines are in the best interests of Buyer, its
Affiliates and their stockholders. The obligation of Buyer to make payments to
Sellers under this Section 2.06(b) is strictly a contractual relationship
between Buyer and Sellers and does not create any express or implied fiduciary
or special relationship between Buyer and Sellers or create any express or
implied fiduciary, special or other duties on the part of Buyer to Sellers.

  

  

(vii) Sellers acknowledge that information provided by Buyer to Sellers
relating to the calculation of amounts due pursuant to this Section 2.06(b),
to the extent not available to the public, may constitute confidential and/or
material nonpublic information concerning Buyer and its Affiliates ("Nonpublic
Information"). Sellers and Owners acknowledge that purchasing or selling
securities of Buyer's ultimate parent corporation by Persons to whom Buyer
discloses any Nonpublic Information is prohibited until the information is
publicly disclosed. Sellers and Owners shall keep Nonpublic Information
confidential and shall use Nonpublic Information solely for the purpose of
verifying amounts payable under this Section 2.06(b).

  

  

Section 2.07 Allocation of Purchase Price. Sellers and Buyer agree that the
Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities (plus other relevant items) shall
be allocated among the Purchased Assets for all purposes (including Tax and
financial accounting) as shown on the allocation schedule (the "Allocation
Schedule"). A draft of the Allocation Schedule shall be prepared by Buyer and
delivered to Sellers within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date. If
Sellers notify Buyer in writing within ten (10) business days following their
receipt of the Allocation Schedule that Sellers object to one or more items
reflected in the Allocation Schedule, Sellers and Buyer shall resolve such
dispute as provided in Section 2.08. If Sellers fail to deliver a written
notice of objection to Buyer within such ten (10) business day period, Sellers
shall be deemed to have accepted such Allocation Schedule and may not object
to or challenge it thereafter. Buyer and Sellers shall file all Tax Returns
(including amended returns and claims for refund) and information reports in a
manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule. Any adjustments to the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.06 herein shall be allocated in a manner
consistent with the Allocation Schedule.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.08 Resolution of Certain Disputed Amounts. If Buyer or any Seller
disputes the calculation of any amounts payable under Section 2.06(a), or if a
Seller objects in writing to any of the items reflected in the Allocation
Schedule as permitted under Section 2.06(b)(i), then the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute for thirty (30) days after the
date that either Sellers or Buyer notified the other party regarding such
dispute (or, in the case of Section 2.06(b)(i), for thirty (30) days after the
date that Buyer received the written notice called for therein). If Sellers
and Buyer fail to reach an agreement on any such disputed amounts within such
thirty (30) day period, then any amounts remaining in dispute ("Disputed
Amounts" and any amounts not so disputed, the "Undisputed Amounts") shall be
submitted for resolution to the office of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or, if
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is unable to serve, Buyer and Sellers shall appoint
by mutual agreement the office of an impartial nationally recognized firm of
independent certified public accountants other than the accountant used
primarily by either Sellers or Buyer or their respective Affiliates (the
"Independent Accountants") who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall
resolve the Disputed Amounts only. The parties hereto agree that all
adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality. The Independent
Accountants shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the parties
and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the range of values
assigned to each such item by the parties. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountants shall be borne equally by the Buyer and Sellers.

  

  

Section 2.09 Withholding Tax. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Purchase Price all Taxes that Buyer may be required to deduct and
withhold from the Purchase Price under any provision of Tax Law. All such
withheld amounts shall be timely paid by Buyer to the proper Governmental
Authority and if so paid shall be treated as delivered to Sellers hereunder.

  

  

Section 2.10 Third Party Consents. To the extent that Sellers' rights under
any Contract or Permit constituting a Purchased Asset, or any other Purchased
Asset, may not be assigned to Buyer without the consent of another Person
which has not been obtained, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement
to assign the same if an attempted assignment would constitute a breach
thereof or be unlawful, and Sellers, at their expense, shall use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain any such required consent(s) as promptly as
possible. If any such consent shall not be obtained or if any attempted
assignment would be ineffective or would impair Buyer's rights under the
Purchased Asset in question so that Buyer would not in effect acquire the
benefit of all such rights, Sellers, to the maximum extent permitted by law
and the Purchased Asset, shall act after the Closing as Buyer's agent in order
to obtain for it the benefits thereunder and shall cooperate, to the maximum
extent permitted by Law and the Purchased Asset, with Buyer in any other
reasonable arrangement designed to provide such benefits to Buyer.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Section 2.10 to the contrary, Buyer
shall not be deemed to have waived its rights under Section 8.02(c) hereof
unless and until Buyer either provides written waivers thereof or elects to
proceed to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at
Closing.

(a) Buyer will consider for employment all Business Employees employed by a
Seller or AMI with respect to the Business as of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall be construed to obligate Buyer to offer
employment to or to continue the employment of any Business Employees. Sellers
agree to fully pay or otherwise satisfy any claims arising out of or related
to the time period prior to and including the Closing Date brought by any
Business Employee relating to or arising out of (i) their employment by a
Seller or AMI, (ii) any employment contract or labor agreement entered into by
a Seller or AMI, (iii) any Employee Plan liabilities of a Seller or AMI and
(iv) any Law requiring notice of severance, or severance benefit (except as
otherwise provided hereinbelow).

  

  

(b) With respect to any Business Employees to whom Buyer elects to make offers
of employment (which employment would be conditioned upon the Closing of all
transactions contemplated under this Agreement and Sellers' or AMI's
termination of such affected Business Employee's employment with a Seller or
AMI, and would commence on the Closing Date) and who accept such offers and
are hired by Buyer, Buyer shall retain the right to terminate at will (with or
without cause) the employment of any Business Employee hired by Buyer at any
time after the Closing Date. Nothing herein expressed or implied by this
Agreement shall confer upon any Business Employee, or legal representative
thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or benefits
for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason
of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Sellers and AMI, as applicable, shall retain all obligations and
liabilities resulting from Buyer's failure to hire any Business Employees with
respect to compliance with the WARN Act, including any notifications required
thereunder. Under such circumstances, Sellers and AMI shall indemnify, defend
and hold Buyer harmless with respect to any claims, actions, demands, damages,
costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) relating to or arising out of
any failure to comply with the WARN Act.

Section 7.06 Confidentiality. From and after the Closing, each Seller and
Owner shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its or their respective Representatives to
hold, in confidence any and all information, whether written or oral,
concerning the Business, except to the extent that such Seller or Owner can
show that such information (a) is generally available to and known by the
public through no fault of such Seller or Owner, any of its Affiliates or
their respective Representatives; or (b) is lawfully acquired by such Seller
or Owner, any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and
after the Closing from sources which are not prohibited from disclosing such
information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation or (c) as required
by law. If any Seller or Owner, or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or
administrative process or by other requirements of Law, such Seller or Owner
shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that portion of
such information which such Seller or Owner is advised by its counsel in
writing is legally required to be disclosed, provided that such Seller or
Owner shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective
order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded such information. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, hold, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its or their respective Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all
information, whether written or oral, concerning the Business, except to the
extent that Buyer can show that such information (a) is generally available to
and known by the public through no fault of Buyer, any of its Affiliates or
their respective Representatives; or (b) is lawfully acquired by Buyer, any of
its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after the Closing
from sources which are not prohibited from disclosing such information by a
legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation or (c) as required by law. If
Buyer, or any of its Affiliates or Representatives are compelled to disclose
any information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements
of Law, such person or entity shall promptly notify Sellers in writing and
shall disclose only that portion of such information which such entity or
person is advised by its counsel in writing is legally required to be
disclosed, provided that such entity or person shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a conflict between the
provisions of this Section 7.06 and the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the provisions of this Section 7.06 shall control.

  

  

Section 7.07 Non-competition; Non-solicitation

  

  

(a) For a period of five (5) years commencing on the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"), no Seller or Owner shall, and none of them shall permit
any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in or assist
others in engaging in the Restricted Business in the Territory; (ii) have an
interest in any Person that engages directly or indirectly in the Restricted
Business in the Territory in any capacity, including as a partner,
shareholder, member, employee, principal, agent, trustee or consultant; or
(iii) cause, induce or encourage any material actual or prospective client,
customer, supplier or licensor of the Business (including any existing or
former client or customer of a Seller and any Person that becomes a client or
customer of the Business after the Closing), or any other Person who has a
material business relationship with the Business, to terminate or modify any
such actual or prospective relationship. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
Seller or Owner may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment,
securities of any Person traded on any national securities exchange if such
Seller or Owner is not a controlling Person of, or a member of a group which
controls, such Person and does not, directly or indirectly, own 3% or more of
any class of securities of such Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it
shall not be a violation of this Section 7.07(a) for Sellers and Owners and
their Affiliates to arrange for third-party transportation on behalf of
customers of Sellers' retained terminal business.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) During the Restricted Period, no Seller or Owner shall, nor shall any
Seller or Owner permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire
or solicit any person who is offered employment by Buyer pursuant to Section
7.05, or is or was employed in the Business during the Restricted Period, or
encourage any such employee to leave such employment or hire any such employee
who has left such employment, except pursuant to a general solicitation which
is not directed specifically to any such employees; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 7.07(b) shall prevent any Seller or Owner, or any of
their respective Affiliates from hiring any employee whose employment has been
terminated by Buyer.

  

  

(c) Each Seller and Owner acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of
this Section 7.07 would give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer, for which
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in
the event of a breach or a threatened breach by such Seller or Owner of any
such obligations, Buyer shall, in addition to any and all other rights and
remedies that may be available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to
equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction,
specific performance and any other relief that may be available from a court
of competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond).

  

  

(d) Each Seller and Owner acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this
Section 7.07 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests
of Buyer and constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
the event that any covenant contained in this Section 7.07 should ever be
adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is
expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed
reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or
service or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants
contained in this Section 7.07 and each provision hereof are severable and
distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
such covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such
invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

  

  

Section 7.08 Governmental Approvals and Consents.

  

  

(a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, (i) make, or cause or be
made, all filings and submissions (including those under the HSR Act) required
under any Law applicable to such party or any of its Affiliates; and (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals from all Governmental Authorities that
may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the performance of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents. Each party shall cooperate fully with the other
party and its Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals. The parties hereto shall not willfully
take any action that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding
the receipt of any required consents, authorizations, orders and approvals.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to give all notices
to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties that are described in
Section 4.03, Section 5.03 and Section 6.03 of the Disclosure Schedules.

  

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the parties' undertakings pursuant to
subsections (a) and (b) above, each of the parties hereto shall use all
reasonable best efforts to:

  

  

(i) respond to any inquiries by any Governmental Authority regarding antitrust
or other matters with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document;

  

  

(ii) avoid the imposition of any order or the taking of any action that would
restrain, alter or enjoin the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document; and

  

  

(iii) in the event any Governmental Order adversely affecting the ability of
the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document has been issued, to have such Governmental
Order vacated or lifted.

  

  

(d) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of
any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions
between a Seller or Buyer with Governmental Authorities in the ordinary course
of business, any disclosure which is not permitted by Law or any disclosure
containing confidential information) shall be disclosed to the other party
hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it being the
intent that the parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any such
analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each party shall give notice to the
other party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact
with any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental
Authority, with such notice being sufficient to provide the other party with
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, discussion,
appearance or contact.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.08 shall require,
or be construed to require, Buyer or any of its Affiliates to agree to (i)
sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before or after the Closing Date,
any assets, businesses or interests of Buyer or any of its Affiliates; (ii)
any conditions relating to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of
any such assets, businesses or interests which, in either case, could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or materially
and adversely impact the economic or business benefits to Buyer of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents; or (iii) any material modification or waiver of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the
parties shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such
announcement.

  

  

Section 7.12 Bulk Sales Laws. The parties hereby waive compliance with the
provisions of any bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Laws of any
jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any
or all of the Purchased Assets to Buyer; it being understood that any
Liabilities arising out of the failure of Sellers to comply with the
requirements and provisions of any bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Laws
of any jurisdiction which would not otherwise constitute Assumed Liabilities

or its Affiliate shall remit any such funds to Sellers within five (5)

exceeds $500,000, in which event Sellers and Owners shall be required to pay
or be liable for all such Losses from the first dollar; provided, however,
that Sellers and Owners collectively shall not be liable to the Buyer
Indemnitees for indemnification under Section 9.02(a) (other than with respect
to a claim for indemnification based upon, arising out of, with respect to or
by reason of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
contained in the Buyer Basket Exclusions) for Losses that exceed $11,600,000
in the aggregate (the "Buyer Aggregate Indemnity Cap").

  

  

(b) Buyer shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnitees for indemnification
under Section 9.03(a) (other than with respect to a claim for indemnification
based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of any inaccuracy in
or breach of any representation or warranty in Section 6.01, Section 6.02 and
Section 6.04 (the "Seller Basket Exclusions")) until the aggregate amount of
all Losses in respect of indemnification under Section 9.03(a) (other than
those based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of the Seller
Basket Exclusions) exceeds $500,000.00, in which event Buyer shall be required
to pay or be liable for all such Losses from the first dollar.

  

  

(c) For purposes of this Article IX, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained
in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty.

  

  

Section 9.05 Indemnification Procedures. The party making a claim under this
Article IX is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party against
whom such claims are asserted under this Article IX is referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party".

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(a) Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any
event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of such notice of
such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced or forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying
Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense; provided, that if the Indemnifying Party is a Seller or
Owner, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or direct
the defense of any such Third Party Claim (A) that (x) is asserted directly by
or on behalf of a Person that is a supplier or customer of the Business, (y)
seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party,
or (z) would, if such Third Party Claim were fully paid, be reasonably likely
to result in Losses for the Buyer in excess of the Buyer Indemnity Cap, and
(B) unless the Indemnifying Party first acknowledges in writing that it is
obligated to indemnify the Buyer against any Losses that may result from such
Third-Party Claim. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section 9.05(b), it shall have
the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend,
appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the
name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel
selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control the
defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party, provided, that if in the reasonable opinion
of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to
an Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available
to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for which the
Indemnified Party determines counsel is required. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to promptly
notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided
in this Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 9.05(b), pay,
compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and
all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim.
Sellers, Owners and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable
respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including
making available (subject to the provisions of Section 7.06) records relating
to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than
reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary
for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

  

  

(b) Settlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
except as provided in this Section 9.05(b). If a firm offer is made to settle
a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party
Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer,
the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified
Party may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such
event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party
Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified
Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party
Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section
9.05(a), it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30)
days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced or forfeits rights or
defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall
describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all
material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after
its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the
Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect
of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying
Party's investigation by giving such information and assistance (including
access to the Indemnified Party's premises and personnel and the right to
examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party
or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such thirty (30) day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.06 Payments. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or
finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article IX (a "Final
Indemnification Loss"), the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations
within fifteen (15) Business Days of such final, non-appealable adjudication
by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The parties hereto agree that
should an Indemnifying Party not make full payment of any such obligations
within such fifteen (15) Business Day period, any amount payable shall accrue
interest from and including the date of agreement of the Indemnifying Party or
final, non-appealable adjudication to but excluding the date such payment has
been made at a rate per annum equal to 5%. Such interest shall be calculated
daily on the basis of a 365 day year and the actual number of days elapsed and
shall be compounded quarterly. In the case of Final Indemnification Loss
payable by Sellers or Owners, the amount payable shall first be distributed
from the escrow account maintained under the Escrow Agreement to the extent of
any funds remaining in such account and any amounts that remain unpaid after
distribution of all amounts remaining in such account (or that are not paid
within fifteen (15) Business Days after a Loss becomes a Final Indemnification
Loss) shall be payable, jointly and severally, but Sellers and Owners. The
parties hereto shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written
instructions (and any other documents or instruments reasonably requested by
the Escrow Agent or that are required to be executed and delivered pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement in connection with a distribution of amounts from such
escrow account) instructing the Escrow Agent to pay any amounts payable to a
Buyer Indemnitee in respect of a Final Indemnification Loss.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 9.07 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and
covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
(including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the
Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives knew or should have known that
any such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by
reason of the Indemnified Party's waiver of any condition set forth in Section
8.02 or Section 8.03, as the case may be.

  

  

Section 9.08 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 7.07 and Section 11.11,
the parties acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, their sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than claims
arising from fraud, criminal activity or wilful misconduct on the part of a
party hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth
in this Article IX. Nothing in this Section 9.08 shall limit any Person's
right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person shall be
entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any Person's fraudulent, criminal
or intentional misconduct.

Section 10.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of Sellers and Buyer;

  

  

(b) by Buyer by written notice to Sellers if:

  

  

(i) Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement
and there has been a breach, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions
specified in Article VIII and such breach, inaccuracy or failure has not been
cured by Sellers within twenty (20) days of Sellers' receipt of written notice
of such breach from Buyer; or

  

  

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 or Section 8.02 shall not
have been, or if it becomes apparent that any of such conditions will not be,

failure of Buyer to perform or comply with any of the covenants, agreements or
conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing;

  

  

(c) by Sellers by written notice to Buyer if:

(i) No Seller or Owner is then in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement and there has been a breach, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any

cured by Buyer within twenty (20) days of Buyer's receipt of written notice of

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 or Section 8.03 shall not
have been, or if it becomes apparent that any of such conditions will not be,
fulfilled by December 31, 2012, unless such failure shall be due to the
failure of Sellers or Owners to perform or comply with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by them prior
to the Closing; or

  

  

(d) by Buyer or Sellers in the event that (i) there shall be any Law enacted

obligations hereunder.

any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
remedy, power or privilege.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49

jurisdiction other than those of the State of Delaware.

AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY MAY BE INSTITUTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA OR THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE IN EACH CASE LOCATED IN THE

COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY

Section 11.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement or
