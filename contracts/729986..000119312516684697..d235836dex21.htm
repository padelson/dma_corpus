later date to which the parties may agree in writing.

 



10 ARTICLE IV

 

Consideration; Exchange Procedures

 

4.01 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of any Person:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each holder of a share of Cardinal Common Stock
(other than United and its Subsidiaries, in each case except for shares held
by them in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted)
shall receive in respect thereof, subject to the limitations set forth in
this Agreement, 0.71 shares (" _Exchange Ratio_ ") of United Common Stock (the
" _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(b) _Outstanding United Stock_. Each share of United Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding and unaffected by the Merger.

(c) _Merger Sub Equity Interests_. Each equity interest of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
and unaffected by the Merger, and no consideration shall be issued in exchange
therefor.

 

4.02 _Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers._ At the Effective Time, holders
of Cardinal Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
stockholders of Cardinal, other than to receive the Merger Consideration (if
so provided in Section 4.01(a)) and any dividend or other distribution with
respect to such Cardinal Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to
the Effective Time and the consideration provided under this Article IV. After
the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
Cardinal or the Surviving Entity of shares of Cardinal Common Stock.

 

4.03 _Fractional Shares._ Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of United Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefore, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger; instead, United shall pay to each holder of Cardinal Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of United Common
Stock (after taking into account all Old Certificates registered in the name
of such holder or Book-Entry Shares held by such holder) an amount in cash
(without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction by the average of
the daily closing prices for the shares of United Common Stock for the 20
consecutive full trading days on which such shares are actually traded on the
NASDAQ (as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported thereby,
any other authoritative source) ending at the close of trading on the tenth
trading day immediately preceding the Effective Date (such average, the "
_Average Closing Price_ ").

 

4.04 _Exchange Procedures._

 

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, United shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
certificates formerly representing shares of Cardinal Common Stock (" _Old
Certificates_ ") and holders of non-certificated shares of Cardinal Common
Stock (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), for exchange in accordance with this Article
IV, (i) non-certificated shares of United Common Stock (collectively, "
_United Book-Entry Shares_ ") and (ii) an amount of cash necessary for
payments required by Section 4.03 (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange
Fund will be distributed in accordance with the Exchange Agents normal and
customary procedures established in connection with merger transactions.

 



11 (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event later
than five business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of one or more Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for United Book-Entry Shares,
if any, that the holders of the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
entitled to receive pursuant to Article IV, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares into which the shares of Cardinal Common Stock represented by the Old
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement. Upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (i) a New Certificate representing that number of whole shares of
United Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Article IV, if any, and (ii) a check representing the amount of any cash in
lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered pursuant to
the provisions of this Article IV, and the Old Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

 

(c) Neither the Exchange Agent, if any, nor any party hereto shall be liable
to any former holder of Cardinal Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to United Common Stock
with a record date occurring after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing
shares of Cardinal Common Stock converted in the Merger into the right to
receive shares of such United Common Stock until the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive United Book-Entry Shares in exchange therefore in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 4.04. After becoming
so entitled in accordance with this Section 4.04, the record holder thereof
also shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions by
the Exchange Agent, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to shares of United Common Stock such holder had
the right to receive upon surrender of the Old Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Cardinal on the business day after the one-year
anniversary of the Effective Date shall be paid to United. Any stockholders
of Cardinal who have not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall
thereafter look only to United for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash
in lieu of any fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on
United Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Cardinal Common
Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each
case, without any interest thereon.

 



12 4.05 _Anti-Dilution Provisions._ In the event United changes (or establishes
a record date for changing) the number of shares of United Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date as a result of a stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization
or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding United Common Stock
and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Date, or shall
establish a record date prior to the Effective Date with respect to any
dividend or other distribution in respect of the United Common Stock other
than a cash dividend consistent with past practice, the Exchange Ratio shall
be proportionately adjusted to provide the holders of Cardinal Common Stock
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event.

4.06 _Equity-Based Awards._

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option (each, a " _Cardinal Stock
Option_ ") to purchase shares of Cardinal Common Stock, whether vested or
unvested, under any and all plans of Cardinal under which stock options have
been granted (collectively, the " _Cardinal Stock Plans_ ") shall vest
pursuant to the terms thereof shall be converted into an option (each, a "
_Replacement Option_ ") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Cardinal Stock Option, the number of shares of United
Common Stock equal to (a) the number of shares of Cardinal Common
Stock subject to the Cardinal Stock Option _multiplied_ by (b) the Exchange
Ratio. Such product shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The
exercise price per share (rounded up to the next whole cent) of each
Replacement Option shall equal (y) the exercise price per share of shares of
Cardinal Common Stock that were purchasable pursuant to such Cardinal Stock
Option _divided_ by (z) the Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each Cardinal Stock Option that is intended to be an "incentive stock option"
(as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with
the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and all other options shall be
adjusted in a manner that maintains the options exemption from Section 409A
of the Code. At or prior to the Effective Time, Cardinal shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary consents from optionees with
respect to the Cardinal Stock Plans to permit replacement of the outstanding
Cardinal Stock Options by United pursuant to this Section and to permit United
to assume the Cardinal Stock Plans. Cardinal shall further take all action
necessary to amend the Cardinal Stock Plans to eliminate automatic grants
or awards thereunder following the Effective Time. At the Effective Time,
United shall assume the Cardinal Stock Plans; _provided_ that such assumption
shall only be with respect to the Replacement Options and shall have no
obligation to make any additional grants or awards under the Cardinal Stock
Plans other than those grants or awards that have been made or accrued prior
to the Effective Time. United shall file a post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement or an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or
other applicable form) with respect to the shares of United Common Stock
subject to such Replacement Options, shall distribute a prospectus relating to
such Form S-8, if applicable, and shall use reasonable commercial efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or registration
statement on Form S-8 for so long as such Replacement Options remain
outstanding.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock award granted under a
Cardinal Stock Plan (each, a " _Cardinal Stock Award_ ") that is unvested or
contingent and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully
vest and shall be converted into the right to

 



13  receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 4.01, and the shares of Cardinal Common Stock subject to such Cardinal
Stock Award will be treated in the same manner as all other shares of
Cardinal Common Stock for such purposes.

4.07 _Withholding Rights_. United or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be,
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts, if any, as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Authority by or on behalf of United or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, such amounts withheld will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by United or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

delivered to Cardinal a schedule and Cardinal has delivered to United a
schedule (respectively, its " _Disclosure Schedule_ ") setting forth, among
other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either
in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision
hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties
contained in Section 6.03 or 6.04 or to one or more of its covenants contained
in Article V; _provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth
in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty if
its absence would not be reasonably likely to result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard
set forth in Section 6.02, and (b) the mere inclusion of an item in a
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not
be deemed an admission by a party that such item represents a material
exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the party making the
representation. All of Cardinals and Uniteds representations, warranties and
covenants contained in this Agreement are qualified by reference to its
respective Disclosure Schedule and none thereof shall be deemed to be untrue
or breached as a result of effects arising solely from actions taken in
compliance with a written request of the other party.

 

6.02 _Standard._ No representation or warranty of Cardinal or United contained
in Section 6.03 or 6.04 shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and no party
hereto shall be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty, as a
consequence of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such
fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation or
warranty contained in Section 6.03 or 6.04 has had or is reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the party making the representation. For
purposes of this Agreement, "knowledge" shall mean (i) with respect to
United, actual knowledge of Richard M. Adams, Richard M. Adams, Jr., James J.
Consagra, Jr., Craige L. Smith, W. Mark Tatterson, Douglas Ernest and Darren

or any agreement, indenture or instrument of Cardinal or of any of its
Subsidiaries or to which Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries or properties is

Schedule, neither Cardinal nor any of its Subsidiaries has any commitment to
create any additional Compensation and Benefit Plan or to modify or change

rules promulgated thereunder, and all filings, disclosures and notices
required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age

letter in compliance with the Code (including a determination that the related
trust under such Compensation and Benefit Plan is exempt from tax under

the Compensation and Benefit Plan uses a prototype or volume submitter plan
that is the subject of an IRS opinion or advisory letter, and Cardinal is not
aware of any circumstances that could adversely affect such qualification or
that are likely to result in the revocation of any existing favorable
determination letter or in not receiving a favorable determination letter.

threatened legal action, suit or claim relating to the Compensation and
Benefit Plans other than routine claims for benefits. Neither Cardinal nor any
of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take any
action, with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan that would
reasonably be expected to subject Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries to a
material tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section
502 of ERISA, assuming for purposes of Section 4975 of the Code that the
taxable period of any such transaction expired as of the date hereof.

(iii) No Compensation and Benefit Plans currently maintained, or maintained
within the last six years, by Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries or any

Compensation and Benefit Plan or any employee benefit arrangements under any

Affiliate (x) has provided, or would reasonably be expected to be required to
provide, security to any Pension Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the
Code, and (y) has taken any action, or omitted to take any action, that has
resulted, or would reasonably be expected to result, in the imposition of a
lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA.

provide retiree health and life insurance, retiree long-term care insurance

other than benefits mandated by Section 4980B of the Code, and each such
Compensation and Benefit Plan may be amended or 

 



25  terminated without incurring liability thereunder, and there has been no
communication to Employees by Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries that would
reasonably be expected to promise or guarantee such Employees retiree health
or life insurance or retiree death or other benefits on a permanent basis.

Benefit Plans covering foreign Employees.

Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
would not, directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, as a result
of any termination of employment prior to or following the Effective Time)
reasonably be expected to (A) entitle any Employee, Consultant or Director to
any payment (including severance pay or similar compensation) or any increase
in compensation, (B) result in the vesting or acceleration of any benefits
under any Compensation and Benefit Plan other than the Cardinal Stock Plans
and except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or (C) result in any
material increase in benefits payable under any Compensation and Benefit Plan.

neither United nor Cardinal, or any of their respective Subsidiaries will
be obligated to make a payment to an Employee of Cardinal or any of its
Subsidiaries that would be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" to

in Section 280G of the Code), without regard to whether such payment is
reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in
the future.

plans (each, a " _SERP_ ") or non-qualified deferred compensation plans ("
_Deferred Compensation Plans_ ") between Cardinal and any of its employees

of subpart E, part I, subchapter J, chapter 1, subtitle A of the Code that are
subject to claims of creditors, and except as set forth on Section
6.03(m)(xi) of Cardinals Disclosure Schedule, no such grantor trusts are
required to be established on or after the Effective Time by the successor to
Cardinal or any of its subsidiaries as a result, directly or indirectly, of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, as a result of any termination of employment prior to or following
the Effective Time), and each Deferred Compensation Plan that is a SERP
or non-qualified deferred compensation plan of Cardinal is listed on Section
6.03(m)(xi) of Cardinals Disclosure Schedule.

(xii) Except as set forth on Section 6.03(m)(xii) of Cardinals Disclosure
Schedule, neither Cardinal nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any agreement,
taken any action, or omitted to take any action, with respect to or as part of
any Compensation and Benefit Plan that is an operational failure under
Section 409A of the Code or that would reasonably be expected to subject
Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries to any obligation to report any amount or
withhold any amount as includable in income and subject to tax, interest or
any penalty by any service provider to Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries
under Section 409A of the Code or to pay any reimbursement or other payment to
any service provider, as defined under Section 409A of the Code, respecting
any such tax, interest or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, and if any
correction procedure authorized under any IRS guidance with respect to Section
409A is necessary or available on or before the Effective Time to prevent any
such Section 409A document or operational failure, Cardinal agrees to so
correct prior to the Effective Time. As a result, directly or indirectly, of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, as a result of any termination of employment prior to or following
the Effective Time), neither Cardinal nor any of its Subsidiaries will be
obligated to report any amount or withhold any amount as includable in income
and subject to tax, interest or any penalty by any service provider (as
defined under Section 409A of the Code) to Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries
under Section 409A of the Code or to pay any reimbursement or other payment to
any service provider (as defined under Section 409A of the Code) respecting
any such Tax, interest or penalty under Section 409A of the Code and no
provision of any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans, or any actions taken
or omitted thereunder, violate Section 409A of the Code.

(n) _Labor Matters_. Neither Cardinal nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to or is bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is
Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that

the VSCA (collectively, " _Takeover Laws_ ").

 

(p) _Environmental Matters_. To Cardinals knowledge, neither the conduct nor
operation of Cardinal or its Subsidiaries nor any condition of any property
presently or previously owned, leased or operated by any of them (including,
without limitation, in a fiduciary or agency capacity), or on which any of
them holds a Lien, violates or violated Environmental Laws and to Cardinals

has been administered and, where applicable, serviced, and the relevant
Cardinal Loan files are being maintained, in all respects in accordance with
the relevant notes or other credit or security documents, Cardinals written

laws.

 



29 (iii) None of the contracts pursuant to which Cardinal has sold Cardinal Loans

Cardinal Loans contains any obligation to repurchase such Cardinal Loans or
interests therein solely on account of a payment default by the obligor on any

determining the adequacy of its ALLL and in compliance in all material
respects with the standards established by the applicable Regulatory
Authority, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and GAAP.

those assets reflected in the most recent Cardinal financial statements as
being owned by Cardinal or acquired after the date thereof (except assets sold
or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of
business), free and clear of all liens, except (a) statutory liens securing
payments not yet due, (b) liens for real property Taxes not yet due and
payable, (c) easements, rights of way, and other similar encumbrances that do
not materially affect the use of the properties or assets subject thereto or
affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at such
properties, and (d) such imperfections or irregularities of title or liens as
do not materially affect the use of the properties or assets subject thereto
or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at such
properties (collectively, " _Permitted Liens_ "). Cardinal is the lessee of
all leasehold estates reflected in the latest Cardinal financial statements,
free and clear of all liens of any nature whatsoever, except for Permitted
Liens, and is in possession of the properties purported to be leased
thereunder, and each such lease is valid without default thereunder by the
lessee or, to the knowledge of Cardinal, the lessor. There are no pending or,
to the knowledge of Cardinal, threatened condemnation or eminent domain
proceedings against any real property that is owned or leased by Cardinal.
Cardinal owns or leases all properties as are necessary to its operations now
conducted.

the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute such a
default.

(l) _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(i) United has Previously Disclosed a complete and accurate list of all
existing bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, pension,
retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, stock
bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option, severance, welfare and
fringe benefit plans, employment or severance agreements and all similar
practices, policies and arrangements in which any current or former employee
(the " _United Employees_ "), current or former consultant (the " _United
Consultants_ ") or current or former director (the " _United Directors_ ")
of United or any of its Subsidiaries participates or to which any United
Employees, United Consultants or United Directors are a party (the " _United
Compensation and Benefit Plans_ ").

 

(ii) Each United Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and with
applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, or any
regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all filings, disclosures and
notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and any other applicable law have
been timely made. Each Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "
_United Pension Plan_ ") and which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter (including a
determination that the related trust under such United Compensation and
Benefit Plan is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code) from the IRS
or the Compensation and Benefit Plan uses a prototype or volume submitter plan
that is the subject of an IRS opinion or advisory letter, and United is not
aware of any circumstances that could adversely affect such qualification or
which are likely to result in the revocation of any existing favorable
determination letter or in not receiving a favorable determination letter.
There is no material pending or, to the knowledge of United, threatened legal
action, suit or claim relating to the United Compensation and Benefit Plans
other than routine claims for benefits. Neither United 

 



36  nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take
any action, with respect to any United Compensation and Benefit Plan that
would reasonably be expected to subject United or any of its Subsidiaries to
a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of
ERISA, assuming for purposes of Section 4975 of the Code that the taxable
period of any such transaction expired as of the date hereof.

(iii) No liability (other than for payment of premiums to the PBGC which have
been made or will be made on a timely basis) under Title IV of ERISA has been
or is expected to be incurred by United or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained
by any of them, or any single-employer plan of any entity (a " _United ERISA
Affiliate_ ") which is considered one employer with United under Section
4001(a)(14) of ERISA or Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code (a " _United ERISA
Affiliate Plan_ "). None of United, any of its Subsidiaries or any United
ERISA Affiliate has contributed, or has been obligated to contribute, to a
multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA at any time since
September 26, 1980. No notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been
waived, has been required to be filed for any United Compensation and Benefit
Plan or by any United ERISA Affiliate Plan within the 12-month period ending
on the date hereof, and no such notice will be required to be filed as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The PBGC has not
instituted proceedings to terminate any Pension Plan or United ERISA Affiliate
Plan and, to Uniteds knowledge, no condition exists that presents a material
risk that such proceedings will be instituted. To the knowledge of
United, there is no pending investigation or enforcement action by the PBGC,
the DOL or IRS or any other governmental agency with respect to any United
Compensation and Benefit Plan. Under each United Pension Plan and United ERISA
Affiliate Plan, as of the date of the most recent actuarial valuation
performed prior to the date of this Agreement, the actuarially determined
present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions
contained in such actuarial valuation of such United Pension Plan or United
ERISA Affiliate Plan), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of
such United Pension Plan or United ERISA Affiliate Plan and since such date
there has been neither an adverse change in the financial condition of such
United Pension Plan or United ERISA Affiliate Plan nor any amendment or other
change to such Pension Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan that would increase
the amount of benefits thereunder which reasonably could be expected to
change such result.

(iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any United
Compensation and Benefit Plan or United ERISA Affiliate Plan or any employee
benefit arrangements under any collective bargaining agreement to which United
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party have been timely made or have been
reflected on Uniteds financial statements. Neither any United Pension Plan
nor any United ERISA Affiliate Plan has an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code
or Section 302 of ERISA and all required payments to the PBGC with respect to
each United Pension Plan or United ERISA Affiliate Plan have been made on or
before their due dates. None of United, any of its Subsidiaries or any United
ERISA Affiliate (x) has provided, or would reasonably be expected to be
required to provide, security to any United Pension Plan or to any United
ERISA Affiliate Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code, and (y) has 

 



37  taken any action, or omitted to take any action, that has resulted, or would
reasonably be expected to result, in the imposition of a lien under Section
412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA.

(v) Neither United nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations to provide
retiree health and life insurance, retiree long-term care insurance, retiree
death or other benefits, other than a program to offer to remit premiums and
provide some administrative tasks with respect to retiree health and life
insurance paid by retirees under any United Compensation and Benefit Plan,
other than benefits mandated by Section 4980B of the Code, and each such
United Compensation and Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated without
incurring liability thereunder and there has been no communication to
Employees by United or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be
expected to promise or guarantee such Employees retiree health or life
insurance, retiree death or other benefits on a permanent basis.

 

(vi) United and its Subsidiaries do not maintain any United Compensation and
Benefit Plans covering foreign Employees.

 

(vii) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
would not, directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, as a result
of any termination of employment prior to or following the Effective Time)
reasonably be expected to (A) entitle any United Employee, United Consultant
or United Director to any payment (including severance pay or
similar compensation) or any increase in compensation, (B) result in the
vesting or acceleration of any benefits under any United Compensation and
Benefit Plan or (C) result in any material increase in benefits payable under
any United Compensation and Benefit Plan.

(viii) Except for compensation paid to Richard M. Adams, neither United nor
any of its Subsidiaries maintains any compensation plans, programs or
arrangements the payments under which would not reasonably be expected to be
deductible as a result of the limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code and
the regulations issued thereunder.

 

(ix) As a result, directly or indirectly, of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including, without limitation, as a result of any termination
of employment prior to or following the Effective Time), neither United nor
Cardinal, or any of their respective Subsidiaries will be obligated to make a
payment with respect to any person who is an employee, before the Effective
Time, of United or any of its Subsidiaries, that would be characterized as an
"excess parachute payment" to an individual who is a "disqualified individual"
(as such terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code), without regard to
whether such payment is reasonable compensation for personal services
performed or to be performed in the future.

(x) Neither United nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any agreement, taken
any action, or omitted to take any action, with respect to or as part of any
United Compensation and Benefit Plan that is an operational failure under
Section 409A of the Code or that would reasonably be expected to subject
United or any of its Subsidiaries to any obligation to report any amount or
withhold any amount as includable in income and subject to tax, interest or
any penalty by any service provider to United or any of its Subsidiaries
under Section 409A of

 



38  the Code or to pay any reimbursement or other payment to any service
provider, as defined under Section 409A of the Code, respecting any such tax,
interest or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(m) _No Brokers_. No action has been taken by United that would give rise to
any valid claim against any party hereto for a brokerage commission, finders
fee or other like payment with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, excluding a Previously Disclosed fee to Keefe, Bruyette and
Woods, Inc.

 

(n) _Labor Matters_. Neither United nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or is bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is
United or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that
it or any such Subsidiary has committed an unfair labor practice (within
the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel United
or any such Subsidiary to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or
conditions of employment, nor is there any strike or other labor dispute
involving it or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to Uniteds knowledge,
threatened, nor is United aware of any activity involving its or any of its
Subsidiaries employees seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or
engaging in other organizational activity.

(o) _Takeover Laws_. United has taken all action required to be taken by it in
order to exempt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from,
and this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are exempt from,
the requirements of any Takeover Laws applicable to United.

 

(p) _Environmental Matters_. To Uniteds knowledge, neither the conduct nor
operation of United or its Subsidiaries nor any condition of any property
presently or previously owned, leased or operated by any of them (including,
without limitation, in a fiduciary or agency capacity), or on which any of
them holds a Lien, violates or violated Environmental Laws and to Uniteds
knowledge no condition has existed or event has occurred with respect to any
of them or any such property that, with notice or the passage of time, or
both, is reasonably likely to result in liability under Environmental Laws.
To Uniteds knowledge, neither United nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice from any person or entity that United or its Subsidiaries
or the operation or condition of any property ever owned, leased, operated or
held as collateral or in a fiduciary capacity by any of them are or were in
violation of or otherwise are alleged to have liability under any
Environmental Law, including, but not limited to, responsibility (or potential
responsibility) for the cleanup or other remediation of any pollutants,
contaminants, or hazardous or toxic wastes, substances or materials at, on,
beneath or originating from any such property.

 

(q) _Tax Matters_. All Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to United and its Subsidiaries have been timely filed (taking into
account all applicable extensions), and all Taxes shown to be due on such Tax
Returns have been paid in full, other than Taxes that are being contested in
good faith, which have not been finally determined, and have been
adequately reserved against in accordance with GAAP on Uniteds consolidated
financial statements as of December 31, 2015. All assessments for Taxes of
United or any of its Subsidiaries due with respect to completed and settled
examinations or any concluded litigations

 



39  have been fully paid. There are no disputes, audits, examinations or
proceedings pending, or claims asserted, for Taxes upon United or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither United nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any
extension or waiver of the limitation period for the assessment or collection
of Tax that remains in effect. Neither United nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any liability with respect to income, franchise or similar Taxes that accrued
on or before December 31, 2015 in excess of the amounts accrued with respect
thereto that are reflected in the consolidated financial statements of United

or impede the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

(r) _Risk Management Instruments_. Neither United nor any of its Subsidiaries
are parties to any interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements,

and its Subsidiaries are insured with insurers believed to be reputable
against such risks and in such amounts as the management of United reasonably
has determined to be prudent in accordance with industry practices. All
such insurance policies are in full force and effect; United and its
Subsidiaries are not in material default thereunder; and all claims thereunder
have been filed in due and timely fashion.

 

(u) _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The board of directors of United has
received the opinion (which, if initially rendered verbally, has been or will
be confirmed by a written opinion, dated the same date) of Keefe, Bruyette and
Woods, Inc., to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based
upon and subject to factors, assumptions and limitations set forth therein,
the Exchange Ratio to be paid to the holders of Cardinal Common Stock is
fair, from a financial point of view, to United. Such opinion has not been
amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(v) _Loan Matters_.

(i) Each United Loan currently outstanding (A) is evidenced by notes,
agreements or other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine and what
they purport to be, (B) to the extent secured, has been secured by valid liens
that have been perfected and (C) to the knowledge of United, is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in
accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership,
conservatorship, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and except

 



40  that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or
injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding may be brought). The notes or other credit or security documents
with respect to each such outstanding United Loan were executed and delivered
in compliance in all respects with all applicable laws at the time of
origination or purchase by United and are complete and correct in all
respects.

(ii) Each outstanding United Loan was solicited and originated, and is and has
been administered and, where applicable, serviced, and the relevant United
Loan files are being maintained, in all respects in accordance with the
relevant notes or other credit or security documents, Uniteds written
underwriting standards and with all applicable requirements of applicable
laws.

(w) _Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses_. The ALLL reflected in the most
recent United financial statements was in compliance with Uniteds existing
methodology for determining the adequacy of its ALLL and in compliance in all
material respects with the standards established by the applicable Regulatory
Authority, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and GAAP.

(x) _Assets_. United or its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to
those assets reflected in the most recent United financial statements as
being owned by United or acquired after the date thereof (except assets sold
or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of
business), free and clear of all liens, except Permitted Liens. United is the
lessee of all leasehold estates reflected in the latest United financial
statements, free and clear of all liens of any nature whatsoever, except for
Permitted Liens, and is in possession of the properties purported to be leased
thereunder, and each such lease is valid without default thereunder by the
lessee or, to the knowledge of United, the lessor. There are no pending or, to
the knowledge of United, threatened condemnation or eminent domain proceedings
against any real property that is owned or leased by United. United owns or
leases all properties as are necessary to its operations now conducted.

(y)  _Representations and Warranties of United with Respect to Merger Sub_.

(i) O _rganization, Standing and Authority_. Merger Sub is duly organized and
validly existing in good standing under the laws of the state of its
organization, and is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in the
jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct
of its business requires it to be so qualified. Merger Sub is a bank holding
company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended.

 

(ii) _Power_. Merger Sub has the power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(iii) _Authority_. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby have been authorized by all requisite action on the part of Merger Sub
and its respective subsidiaries or members. This Agreement is a valid and
legally binding agreement of Merger Sub enforceable in accordance with its
terms (except as enforceability may be limited by

 



41  applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights or by general equity principles).

issuance of the Merger Consideration and, as necessary, the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement, provided that the United Board may fail to
make such a recommendation, or

 



42  withdraw, modify or change any such recommendation, if the United Board,
after having consulted with and considered the advice of outside counsel, has
determined that the making of such recommendation, or the failure to
withdraw, modify or change such recommendation, would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the members of the United Board
under applicable law.

 

(c) Cardinal and United shall use their reasonable best efforts to hold their
respective stockholder meetings on the same date and as close in time to the
Effective Date as reasonably practicable.

7.03 _Registration Statement._

 

(a) United agrees to prepare a registration statement on Form S-4 (the "
_Registration Statement_ ") to be filed by United with the SEC in connection
with the issuance of United Common Stock in the Merger (including the
prospectus of United and proxy solicitation materials of United and Cardinal
constituting a part thereof (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and all related
documents). Cardinal and United agree to cooperate, and to cause their
respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, to cooperate, with the other and its
counsel and its accountants in the preparation of the Registration Statement
and the Proxy Statement. United agrees to file the Registration Statement
(including the Proxy Statement in preliminary form) with the SEC as promptly
as reasonably practicable and in any event within 120 days from the date of
this Agreement. Each of Cardinal and United agrees to use all reasonable
efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after filing thereof.
United also agrees to use all reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the
effective date of the Registration Statement, all necessary state securities
law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of United and Cardinal agrees to furnish
to the other party all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
officers, directors and stockholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable or as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the Registration Statement, Proxy Statement or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of United,
Cardinal or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, to any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Cardinal shall have the right to review and
consult with United and approve the form of, and any characterization of such
information included in, the Registration Statement prior to its being filed
with the SEC.

(b) Each of Cardinal and United agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries and
affiliates, as applicable, that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement and each
amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and (ii) the Proxy Statement and
any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to
stockholders and at the time of the Cardinal Meeting, as the case may be,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading or any statement which, in the light of the
circumstances under which such statement is made, will be false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or which will omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading
or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier statement in the Proxy
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto. Each of Cardinal and 

 



43  United further agrees that if it shall become aware prior to the date of the
Cardinal Meeting or United Meeting, as the case may be, of any information
furnished by it that would cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement
to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take the
necessary steps to correct the Proxy Statement.

(c) United agrees to advise Cardinal, promptly after United receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of
any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of United Stock for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any
proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the
amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional
information.

 

7.04 _Access; Information._

 

(a) Each of Cardinal and United agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject
to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford
the other party and the other partys officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other authorized representatives, such access during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the books,
records (including, without limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of
independent auditors), properties, personnel and to such other information as
any party may reasonably request and, during such period, it shall furnish
promptly to such other party (i) a copy of each material report, schedule and
other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws, and (ii) all other information concerning the business,
properties and personnel of it as the other may reasonably request. Neither
United or its Subsidiaries nor Cardinal or its Subsidiaries shall be required
to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of United, Cardinal
or their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, or contravene any
applicable law or regulation or binding contract, agreement or arrangement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement; and in any such event, the
parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

(b) Each of Cardinal and United agrees that it will not, and will cause
its representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this
Section 7.04 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date
hereof in connection with the entering into of this Agreement) for any purpose
unrelated to the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the requirements of law, each party
will keep confidential, and will cause its representatives to keep
confidential, all information and documents obtained pursuant to this Section
7.04 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in
connection with the entering into of this Agreement) unless such information
(i) was already known to such party, (ii) becomes available to such party
from other sources not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality
obligation, (iii) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the party to
which such information pertains or (iv) is or becomes readily ascertainable
from published information or trade sources. In the event that this Agreement
is terminated or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
otherwise fail

 



44  to be consummated, each party shall promptly cause all copies of documents
or extracts thereof containing information and data as to another party hereto
to be returned to the party that furnished the same. No investigation by
either party of the business and affairs of the other shall affect or be
deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
in this Agreement, or the conditions to either partys obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
each party shall promptly furnish the other with copies of all monthly and
other interim financial statements produced in the ordinary course of business
as the same shall become available.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.04 are in addition to, and not in lieu
of, those certain confidentiality agreements dated May 23, 2016 and August
10, 2016, between United and Cardinal (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
the terms of which are specifically confirmed.

 

7.05 _Acquisition Proposals._ Cardinal agrees that it shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its officers, directors, agents, advisors and
affiliates not to, solicit or encourage inquiries or proposals with respect
to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential
information to, or have any discussions with any person relating to, any
Acquisition Proposal. It shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted prior to the date of
this Agreement with any parties other than United with respect to any of the
foregoing and shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any
confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal.
Cardinal will inform United promptly of all relevant details of any inquiries
or contacts by third parties relating to the possible disposition of the
business or the capital stock of Cardinal or any merger, change or control or
other business combination involving Cardinal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this Section 7.05 shall prohibit Cardinal, prior to the
Cardinal Meeting and subject to compliance with the other terms of this
Section 7.05, from furnishing nonpublic information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, any Person that makes an unsolicited, bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal with respect to Cardinal or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries (that did not result from a breach of this Section
7.05), if, and only to the extent that (i) the Cardinal Board concludes in
good faith, after consultation with and based upon the advice of outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such actions would be reasonably
likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders
under applicable law, (ii) before taking such actions, Cardinal receives from
such Person an executed confidentiality agreement providing for reasonable
protection of confidential information, which confidentiality agreement shall
not provide such person or entity with any exclusive right to negotiate with
Cardinal and shall contain terms and conditions no less favorable to Cardinal
with respect to confidentiality than the Confidentiality Agreement, and (iii)
the Cardinal Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal. Cardinal
shall promptly notify United in writing of Cardinals receipt of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, the material terms and conditions thereof,
the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and
will keep United apprised of any related developments, discussions and
negotiations on a current basis. Cardinal agrees that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 7.05 by any representative of Cardinal
shall be deemed a breach of this Section 7.05 by Cardinal.

 



45 7.06 _Takeover Laws._ No party hereto shall take any action that would
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to
requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them shall take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from any
applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect.

7.07 _Exemption from Liability Under Section_ _ _ _16(b)._ United and
Cardinal agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain
certain directors and officers of Cardinal in connection with the Merger, both
prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that the directors and
officers of Cardinal not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b)
of the Exchange Act, and for that compensatory and retentive purposes agree to
the provisions of this Section 7.07. The United Board, or a committee of
"Non-Employee Directors" (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act) thereof, shall promptly, and in any event
prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause any dispositions of Cardinal Common Stock, Cardinal Stock
Awards, Cardinal Stock Options or acquisitions (and any subsequent
dispositions) of United Common Stock or Replacement Options by the directors
and officers of Cardinal, who, immediately following the Merger, will be
directors and officers of United subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to
Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law.

 

7.08 _Regulatory Applications._

 

(a) United and Cardinal and their respective Subsidiaries and affiliates, as
applicable, (a) shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best
efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (b) covenant and agree that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by such party and any of its Subsidiaries and
affiliates, as applicable, for inclusion in any filings with Governmental
Authorities will, at the respective time such filing is made be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made not misleading. Each Party shall use its reasonable
efforts to resolve objections, if any, which may be asserted with respect to
the Merger under any applicable law, regulation or decree, including agreeing
to divest any assets, deposits, lines of business or branches; provided, that
United shall not be required to agree to any condition or take any action if
such agreements or the taking of such action is reasonably likely to result in
any conditions or requirements applicable either before or after the
Effective Time that the United Board reasonably determines in good faith
would have a Material Adverse Effect on United and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole taking into account the consummation of the Merger in making such
determination (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ "). Each of
United and Cardinal shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all

 



46  material written information submitted to any third party or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable and, in any event,
United shall make all necessary filings and provide any necessary notices
within 120 days of the date of this Agreement. Each party hereto agrees that
it will consult with the other party hereto with respect to the obtaining of
all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other party apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including advising the other party
upon receiving any communication from a Governmental Authority the consent or
approval of which is required for the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe
that there is a reasonable likelihood that any required consent or approval
from a Governmental Authority will not be obtained or that the receipt of such
consent or approval may be materially delayed (a " _Regulatory Communication_
"). Upon the receipt of a Regulatory Communication, without limiting the
scope of the foregoing paragraphs, United shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law (i) promptly advise Cardinal of the receipt of any substantive
communication from a Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) provide Cardinal with a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the preparation of any response thereto and the preparation of
any other substantive submission or communication to any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
and to review any such response, submission or communication prior to the
filing or submission thereof, and (iii) provide Cardinal with the opportunity
to participate in any meetings or substantive telephone conversations that
United or its Subsidiaries or their respective representatives may have from
time to time with any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party or
Governmental Authority.

7.09 _Indemnification._

 

(a) Following the Effective Date and for a period of six years thereafter,
United shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present directors,
officers and employees of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against all costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time to the fullest extent that Cardinal is permitted or required to
indemnify (and advance expenses to) its directors and officers under the laws
of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Cardinal Certificate, the

 



47  Cardinal Bylaws and any agreement as in effect on the date hereof;
_provided_ that any determination required to be made with respect to whether
an officers, directors or employees conduct complies with the standards
set forth under Virginia law, the Cardinal Certificate, the Cardinal Bylaws
and any agreement shall be made by independent counsel (which shall not be
counsel that provides material services to United) selected by United and
reasonably acceptable to such officer or director. United shall comply with
any indemnification agreements between Cardinal or its Subsidiaries on the one
hand, and their respective directors and officers on the other hand;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, agrees to exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain
amendments to each indemnification agreement applicable to it prior to the
Effective Date so that terms of any such agreement aligns with the time
periods set forth in this Section 7.09.

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, United shall
(i) maintain in effect (A) the current provisions regarding indemnification of
and the advancement of expenses to Indemnified Parties contained in the
Cardinal Certificate and Cardinal Bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) of each of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries and (B) any
indemnification agreements of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries with or for the
benefit of any Indemnified Parties existing on the date hereof, and (ii)
indemnify the Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law. For purposes of the foregoing: (i) in the event any claim is
asserted within the six year period during which Cardinal and its
Subsidiaries, (A) all such rights in respect of any such claim shall continue
until disposition thereof and (B) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
advancement of expenses within five business days following receipt of any
such claim involving such Indemnified Party; and (ii) any determination
required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct
complies with the standards set forth under VSCA, the Cardinal Certificate or
Cardinal Bylaws or any such agreement, as the case may be, for purposes of
the allowance of indemnification or advancement of expenses, shall be made by
independent legal counsel selected by such Indemnified Party and reasonably
acceptable to United. The fees and expenses of such independent legal counsel
shall be paid for by United.

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, United shall use
its reasonable best efforts to provide that portion of directors and
officers liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former
officers and directors of Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as
of the Effective Time) (as opposed to Cardinal) with respect to claims
against such directors and officers arising from facts or events which
occurred before the Effective Time, which insurance shall contain at least the
same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by Cardinal; _provided_ ,
that in no event shall United be required to expend, on an annual basis, more
than 200% of the current annual amount expended by Cardinal (the " _Insurance
Amount_ ") to maintain or procure such directors and officers insurance
coverage; _provided_ , _further_ , that if United is unable to maintain or
obtain the insurance called for by this Section 7.09(c), United shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available
for the Insurance Amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that officers and directors
of Cardinal or any Subsidiary may be required to make application and provide
customary representations and warranties to Uniteds insurance carrier for the
purpose of obtaining such insurance.

 



48 (d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
7.09(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, shall promptly notify United thereof;
_provided_ that the failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of
United under Section 7.09(a) unless and to the extent that United is actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(e) If United or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or
merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any entity, then and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of United shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.09.

(f) The provisions of this Section 7.09, (i) shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, and (ii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by agreement or otherwise.

7.10  _Benefit Plans._

(a) At and following the Effective Time (i) United shall provide employees of
Cardinal and its Subsidiaries with employee benefit plans substantially
similar to those provided to similarly situated employees of United, except
with respect to the United Pension Plan, (ii) United shall cause any and all
pre-existing condition limitations (to the extent such limitations did not
apply to a pre-existing condition under the Compensation and Benefit Plans)
and eligibility waiting periods under group health plans to be waived with
respect to such employees and their eligible dependents, and (iii) all
employees of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries shall receive credit for years of
service with Cardinal, its Subsidiaries and their predecessors prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not for
purposes of benefit accrual other than accrual for vacation; _provided_ ,
that, in accordance with Uniteds policies, no vacation or paid time off shall
thereafter be carried over into a subsequent calendar year except that
employees who are retained by United shall be permitted to carry over
vacation until the end of 2018 and employees who are not retained by United
shall be paid for unused vacation) under Uniteds benefit plans, except with
respect to the United Pension Plan. All employees of Cardinal and its
Subsidiaries and their eligible dependents will receive credit for co-
payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums satisfied by such employees
and dependents under the Compensation and Benefit Plans. Except as provided
in this Agreement, United shall maintain Cardinals and its Subsidiaries
existing employee benefit plans until such time as United has provided similar
plans to employees of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries as contemplated in
the preceding sentence. Employees of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries shall not
be entitled to accrual of benefits or allocation of contributions under
Uniteds benefit plans based on years of service with Cardinal, its
Subsidiaries and their predecessors prior to the Effective Date, except with
respect to any vacation accrual.

 



49 (b) Except for employees of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries with individual
agreements that provide for payment of severance under certain circumstances
(who will be paid severance only in accordance with such agreements and shall
not have a right to employer-paid outplacement services), United agrees that
each employee of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries who is involuntarily
terminated by United or any of its Subsidiaries (other than for cause) on or
within the time period set forth on Section 7.10(b) of Cardinals Disclosure
Schedule, shall receive (i) a severance payment equal to the amounts set
forth on Section 7.10(b) of Cardinals Disclosure Schedule, but only if such
employee does not have rights to a severance payment under an employment
agreement, in which case no severance payment shall be made to such
employee hereunder, and (ii) outplacement services through the date that is
set forth on Section 7.10(b) of Cardinals Disclosure Schedule by an
outplacement agency selected by United.

 

(c) Cardinal shall cause its 401(k) plan to be fully vested and terminated
effective immediately prior to or upon the Effective Time, in accordance with
applicable law and regulations, and Cardinal shall pursue, in Uniteds sole
discretion, the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS
relating to such termination. Each employee of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries
that is a participant in Cardinals 401(k) plan, and that becomes an eligible
employee of United or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, shall be
eligible to participate in Uniteds 401(k) plan as soon as administratively
practical, in accordance with the terms and conditions of Uniteds 401(k)
plan, after the Effective Time, and, account balances under Cardinals
terminated 401(k) plan will be eligible for distribution or rollover,
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the United 401(k) plan and
applicable law and regulation, including direct rollover of cash and, provided
that Cardinals terminated 401(k) plan was validly amended prior to
termination to provide for (A) roll out of promissory notes, (B) a period of
time during which plan termination does not cause immediate loan default, (C)
in-kind distribution of promissory notes, and (D) such other plan provisions
as are required for rollout of promissory notes, direct rollover of
promissory notes to Uniteds 401(k) plan, for each such employee in his or her
discretion. Any other former employee of Cardinal or its Subsidiaries that is
employed by United or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time shall be
eligible to be a participant in Uniteds 401(k) plan upon complying with
eligibility requirements. For purposes of administering Uniteds 401(k) plan,
service with Cardinal and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be service with
United for participation and vesting purposes, but not for purposes of benefit
accrual. United shall take all required actions to assume as of the Effective
Time all obligations under Cardinals Executive Deferred Income Plan, the
George Mason Mortgage, LLC Executive Deferred Income Plan and Cardinals Non-
Employee Directors Deferral Plan; provided, that United shall be under no
obligation to permit further contributions to such plans after the
Effective Time.

(d) Each of United, Cardinal and the key employees of Cardinal, as the case
may be, will enter into agreements concerning their employment with United
and related matters after the Effective Time in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in Section 7.10(d) of the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule.
At and following the Effective Time, United shall honor, and United shall be
obligated to perform, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to honor and perform, in
accordance with their terms and applicable law, the contractual rights of
Employees, Consultants and Directors of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries
existing as of the Effective Time.

 



50 7.11 _Notification of Certain Matters._ Each of Cardinal and United shall
give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to
it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all
other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein.

 

7.12 _Directors._

 

(a) United shall take all appropriate action so that as of the Effective Time
the number of directors constituting the United Board shall be increased by
one and Bernard H. Clineburg shall be appointed as a director of United.
United will nominate Bernard H. Clineburg for election as a director at the
annual meeting of United immediately following the Effective Time and solicit
proxies for Bernard H. Clineburg in the same manner as it does for all other
members of Uniteds slate of directors in connection with such meeting.

 

(b) United shall take all appropriate action so that as of the Effective Time
the number of directors constituting the board of directors of United Bank
shall be increased by two and two individuals from Cardinal shall be appointed
to the board of directors of United Bank. The individuals chosen by Cardinal
to serve as directors of United Bank shall be subject to the consent of
the United Board, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

7.13 _Compliance with Laws_. Each of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries shall
comply in all material respects with all applicable federal, state, local and
foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders or
decrees applicable thereto or to employees conducting such businesses.

 

7.14 _Operating Functions._ Cardinal shall cooperate with United and Merger
Sub in connection with planning for the efficient and orderly combination of
the parties and the operation of United and Merger Sub (including the former
operations of Cardinal) after the Merger, and in preparing for the
consolidation of appropriate operating functions to be effective on the
Effective Time or such later date as United may decide. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (a) neither United nor Merger Sub shall under any circumstance be
permitted to exercise control of Cardinal prior to the Effective Time, (b)
Cardinal shall not be under any obligation to act in a manner that could
reasonably be deemed to constitute anti-competitive behavior under federal or
state antitrust laws and (c) Cardinal shall not be required to agree to any
material obligation that is not contingent upon the consummation of the
Merger.

7.15 _Assumption of TRUPs._ United acknowledges that Cardinal Statutory Trust
I and UFBC Capital Trust I hold subordinated debentures issued by Cardinal and
has issued preferred securities which are intended to be "qualified trust
preferred securities" as defined in applicable regulatory capital guidelines,
or which are eligible for such treatment as grandfathered trust preferred
securities. United agrees that at the Effective Time, it shall expressly
assume all of Cardinals obligations under the indentures relating to
such subordinated debentures (including, without limitation, being
substituted for Cardinal) and execute any and all documents, instruments and
agreements, including any supplemental indentures, guarantees, or declarations
of trust required by said indentures, the subordinated debentures or the
trust preferred securities issued by Cardinal Statutory Trust I and UFBC
Capital Trust I, or as may reasonably be requested by the trustees thereunder,
and thereafter shall perform all of Cardinals obligations with respect to
the subordinated debentures and the trust preferred securities issued by
Cardinal Statutory Trust I and UFBC Capital Trust I (the " _TRUPs Assumption_
").

directors.

( _provided_ that the party seeking termination is not then in material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained

breaching party of such breach.

(c)  _Delay_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by United or Cardinal,
if its board of directors so determines by vote of a majority of the members
of such partys entire board of directors, in the event that the Merger is
not consummated by August 31, 2017, except to the extent that the failure of
the Merger then to be consummated arises out of or results from the knowing
action or inaction of the party seeking to terminate pursuant to this Section
9.01(c).

 

(d) _Failure of United Conditions._ By United in the event that any of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of United to consummate the Merger
contained in Sections 8.03(a), 8.03(b) and 8.03(d) cannot be satisfied or
fulfilled by the date specified in Section 9.01(c) ( _provided_ that the

its material representations or warranties contained in this Agreement).

 



54 (e) _Failure of Cardinal Conditions._ By Cardinal in the event that any of the

Governmental Authority whose approval is required for consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which final
action has become nonappealable and does not approve this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or such Governmental Authority has approved
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby with a Materially
Burdensome Regulatory Condition, or (B) any Governmental Authority whose
approval or nonobjection is required in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby has stated that it will not issue the
required approval or nonobjection, or (ii) any stockholder approval required

United Meeting.

 

(g) _Failure to Recommend, Etc_.

 

(i) At any time prior to the Cardinal Meeting, by United if the Cardinal Board
shall have failed to make its recommendation referred to in Section 7.02,
withdrawn such recommendation or modified or changed such recommendation in a
manner adverse in any respect to the interests of United.

 

(ii) At any time prior to the United Meeting, by Cardinal if the United Board

stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger and (ii) is fully
financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed and reasonably likely
to receive all required approvals of Governmental Authorities on a timely
basis and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms
proposed (a " _Superior Proposal_ " _)_ ; _provided_ , that (i) this Agreement
may be terminated by Cardinal pursuant to this Section 9.01(h) only after the
fifth business day following Uniteds receipt of written notice from Cardinal
advising United that Cardinal is prepared to enter into an agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal and only if, during such five business day
period, United does not make an offer to Cardinal that the Cardinal Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal
advisors, is at least as favorable as the Superior Proposal and (ii) Cardinal
pays the Fee specified in Section 9.03.

 



55 (i) _Decline in United Common Stock Price_. By Cardinal, if the Cardinal Board
so determines by a vote of the majority of the members of the entire Cardinal
Board, at any time during the five-day period commencing with the
Determination Date, if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

 

(i) The number obtained by dividing the Determination Date Average Closing
Price by the Starting Price (as defined below) (the " _United Ratio_ ") shall
be less than 0.80; and

(ii) (x) the United Ratio shall be less than (y) the number obtained by
dividing the Final Index Price by the Index Price on the Starting Date (each
as defined below) and subtracting 0.15 from the quotient in this clause (ii)
(y) (such number in this clause (ii) (y) being referred to herein as, the "
_Index Ratio_ ");

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If Cardinal elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 9.01(i), it shall
give written notice to United ( _provided_ that such notice of election to
terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned five-day
period). During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such
notice, United shall have the option to increase the consideration to be
received by the holders of Cardinal Common Stock hereunder, by adjusting the
Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest one one-thousandth) to equal the
lesser of (x) a number (rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by
dividing (A) the product of the Starting Price, 0.80 and the Exchange Ratio
(as then in effect) by (B) the Determination Date Average Closing Price and
(y) a number (rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by dividing
(A) the product of the Index Ratio and the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect)
by (B) the United Ratio. If United so elects within such five-day period, it
shall give prompt written notice to Cardinal of such election and the revised
Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this
Section 9.01(i) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with
its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified).

For purposes of this Section 9.01(i), the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:

" _Determination Date_ " shall mean the latest of (i) the date on which the
last approval, consent or waiver of any Governmental Authority required to
permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is
received and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof shall have
expired; (ii) the latest date on which the stockholder approvals of both
Cardinal and United set forth in Section 7.02 are received; or (iii) the date
scheduled to integrate Cardinals data processing systems with Uniteds data
processing systems, so long as all conditions set forth in Article VIII have
been satisfied (which date shall be identified by the parties in writing as
soon as practicable after the date hereof).

 



56 " _Determination Date Average Closing Price_ " means the average of the per
share closing prices of a share of United Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global

therein, in another authoritative source) during the 20 consecutive full
trading days ending on the trading day prior to the Determination Date.

" _Final Index Price_ " shall mean the average of the Index Prices for the 20
consecutive full trading days ending on the trading day prior to the
Determination Date.

this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article IX,
no party to this Agreement shall have any liability or further obligation to
any other party hereunder except (i) as set forth in Section 9.03, (ii) that
termination will not relieve a breaching party from liability for any willful
breach of this Agreement giving rise to such termination, and (iii)
Sections 7.03(b), 7.04(b), 9.02, 9.03, 10.05, 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09 and
10.10 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

9.03  _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) In the event that, (i) this Agreement shall be terminated by Cardinal
pursuant to Section 9.01(h), then Cardinal shall pay United promptly (but in
no event later than two business days after the date of termination of this
Agreement by Cardinal) a fee of $36,000,000 (the " _Cardinal Fee_ "), which
amount shall be payable in immediately available funds or (ii) this Agreement
is terminated by United pursuant to Section 9.01(g)(i), and prior to that date
that is 12 months after such termination, Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries
enters into any Acquisition Agreement or any Acquisition Proposal is
consummated (regardless of whether such Acquisition Proposal is consummated
before or after termination of this Agreement), then Cardinal shall pay United

the Effective Time giving rise to the termination right under Section 9.01(c),
or (B) the action or statement by a Governmental Authority giving rise to the
termination right under Section 9.01(f)(i), as applicable, arises solely
because United does not satisfy the condition to approval of a Governmental
Authority requiring it to raise or obtain capital, in accordance with the
terms required by the applicable Governmental Authority, (ii) the following
conditions set forth in Article VIII have been or are reasonably likely to be
satisfied: Sections 8.01(a) (but only with respect to the vote of stockholders

promptly (but in no event later than two business days after the date of
termination of this Agreement) a fee of $13,500,000 (the " _United Fee_ ",
together with the Cardinal Fee, the " _Fees_ ", and each individually, a "
_Fee_ "), which amount shall be payable in immediately available funds.

 

(c) The agreements contained in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.03
shall be deemed an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and without such agreements the parties would not have entered into
this Agreement. A Fee payable pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
Section 9.03 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of United and
Cardinal, respectively, in the event such Fee is payable as specified
therein. In the event that Cardinal or United, as applicable, shall fail to
pay a Fee when due, then such party shall pay such Fee plus the costs and
expenses actually incurred by the other party (including, without limitation,
fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection of such Fee
under the enforcement of this Section 9.03, together with interest on such
unpaid Fee and costs and expenses, commencing on the date that such Fee
became due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by
Citibank, N.A., from time to time, in the City of New York, as such banks
Base Rate plus 2.00%.

CARDINAL FINANCIAL CORPORATION,

 

a Virginia bank holding company

 

with and into

UBV HOLDING COMPANY, LLC,

a Virginia bank holding company

 

1\. _Merger_. Cardinal Financial Corporation (" _Cardinal_ "), a Virginia bank
holding company incorporated pursuant to the Virginia Stock Corporation Act
(the " _VSCA_ "), shall upon the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.a) be
merged (the " _Merger_ ") with and into UBV Holding Company, LLC (" _UBV_ "),
a Virginia bank holding company organized pursuant to the Virginia Limited
Liability Company Act (" _VLLCA_ "), a disregarded entity for income tax
purposes and a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Bankshares, Inc. (" _United_
"), a West Virginia bank holding company incorporated pursuant to the West
Virginia Business Corporation Act, in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the VSCA and the VLLCA. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Cardinal shall cease and UBV shall continue as the
surviving entity (the " _Surviving Entity_ ") following the Merger. The
existence of UBV, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises, shall continue unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger.

2\. _Effective Time; Effects of the Merger_.

 

a. The Merger shall become effective at the latest of: (i) the issuance by the
Virginia State Corporation Commission (the " _SCC_ ") of a certificate of
merger relating to the Merger; and (ii) the time set forth in articles of
merger relating to the Merger to be filed with the SCC; such time referred to
herein as the " _Effective Time_."

b. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 13.1-721 of the VSCA and Section 13.1-1070 of the VLLCA. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time the separate corporate existence of Cardinal shall cease and
all of the properties, rights, powers, privileges, franchises, patents,
trademarks, licenses, registrations and other assets of every kind and
description of Cardinal shall be vested in, and all debts, liabilities and
obligations of Cardinal shall be the obligation of, UBV as the Surviving
Entity, all without further act or deed, in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the VSCA and the VLLCA.

3\. _Articles of Organization_. The articles of organization, as amended, of
UBV in effect at the Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation of
the Surviving Entity, until the same shall thereafter be altered, amended or
repealed as provided therein or by applicable law.

 



A-1 4\. _Operating Agreement_. The operating agreement, as amended, of UBV in
effect at the Effective Time shall be the operating agreement of the
Surviving Entity, until the same shall thereafter be altered, amended or
repealed as provided therein or by applicable law.

 

5\. _Board of Directors; Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the
directors of UBV immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Entity until their successors are duly
appointed or elected. From and after the Effective Time, the officers and
managers of UBV immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers
of the Surviving Entity until their successors are duly appointed or elected.

6\. _Manner and Basis of Converting Securities_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of United, UBV,
Cardinal or any holder of any shares of capital stock of United, UBV or
Cardinal:

a.  _Cardinal Common Stock_.

i. At the Effective Time, each holder of a share of common stock, $1.00 par
value per share, of Cardinal (" _Cardinal Common Stock_ ") (excluding shares
of Cardinal Common Stock held by United, UBV or any United or UBV Subsidiary,
in each case other than in a fiduciary capacity or as a results of debts
previously contracted, which shares shall (i) not be exchanged for shares of
United Common Stock and (ii) be canceled and extinguished for no
consideration, and shall be marked "canceled in merger" as of the Effective
Time) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically
be converted into and exchangeable for the right to receive 0.71 (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of common stock, $2.50 par value per share, of
United (" _United Common Stock_ ", and together with cash in lieu of
fractional shares as provided in Section 6.b below, collectively, the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

ii. Effective as of the Effective Time, each share of Cardinal Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Excluded Shares, as defined in Section 6.f) shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and cease to exist, and each
holder of certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced
shares of Cardinal Common Stock (each, a " _Cardinal Certificate_ "), and each
holder of non-certificated shares of Cardinal Common Stock (" _Cardinal Book-
Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Cardinal Certificate or Cardinal Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section
7.

b. _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of United Common Stock shall
be issued in respect of shares of Cardinal Common Stock that are to be
converted in the Merger into the right to receive shares of United Common
Stock. Holders of Cardinal Common Stock entitled to fractional shares shall be
entitled to receive in lieu of any fractional share of United Common Stock to
which such holder would otherwise have been entitled pursuant to Sections 6.a
and 7 an amount in cash (without interest) (the " _Cash Consideration_ "),
rounded to the nearest whole cent (with one-half cent being rounded upwards),
equal to the product obtained by __multiplying__ (i) the fractional share of
United Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after
taking into account all shares of Cardinal Common Stock held by

 



A-2  such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time) __by__ (ii) the average
of the daily closing prices for United Common Stock for the 20 consecutive
full trading days on which such shares are actually traded on the NASDAQ (as
reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported thereby, any other
authoritative source) ending at the close of trading on the tenth trading day
immediately preceding the Effective Date.

c. _Adjustment for Certain Transactions in United Common Stock_. If, on or
after the date of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, by and between
United and Cardinal, dated as of August 17, 2016 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
and prior to the Effective Time, United changes (or establishes a record date
for changing) the number of shares of United Common Stock issued and
outstanding as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to the
then outstanding United Common Stock, or establishes a record date prior to
the Effective Date with respect to any dividend or distribution in respect of
United Common Stock other than a cash dividend consistent with past practice,
the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted to provide holders of
Cardinal Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by the Merger
Agreement prior to such action.

d. _United Common Stock and UBV Equity Interests_. Each share of United
Common Stock and each equity interest of UBV outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be unchanged, and shall continue to represent an
issued and outstanding share of United Common Stock and an outstanding equity
interest of UBV, respectively.

e. _Cardinal Common Stock Held by United and UBV_. All shares of Cardinal
Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by United, UBV or any of Uniteds or
UBVs respective wholly owned subsidiaries (other than shares held in a
fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall
be cancelled and retired and shall not represent capital stock of the
Surviving Entity and shall not be exchanged for the Merger Consideration; such
cancelled and retired shares are referred to herein as, the " _Excluded
Shares_ ".

 

f. _Cardinal Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option (each, a " _Cardinal Stock
Option_ ") to purchase shares of Cardinal Common Stock, whether vested or
unvested, under any and all plans of Cardinal under which stock options have
been granted (collectively, the

 



A-3  " _Cardinal Stock Plans_ ") shall vest pursuant to the terms thereof and
shall be converted an option (each, a " _Replacement Option_ ") to acquire, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Cardinal Stock
Option, the number of shares of United Common Stock equal to (a) the number of
shares of Cardinal Common Stock subject to the Cardinal Stock Option
_multiplied_ by (b) the Exchange Ratio. Such product shall be rounded down to
the nearest whole number. The exercise price per share (rounded up to the next
whole cent) of each Replacement Option shall equal (y) the exercise price per
share of shares of Cardinal Common Stock that were purchasable pursuant to
such Cardinal Stock Option _divided_ by (z) the Exchange Ratio.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Cardinal Stock Option that is intended to
be an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall
be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and
all other options shall be adjusted in a manner that maintains the options
exemption from Section 409A of the Code. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Cardinal shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary
consents from optionees with respect to the Cardinal Stock Plans to permit
replacement of the outstanding Cardinal Stock Options by United pursuant to
this Section and to permit United to assume the Cardinal Stock Plans.
Cardinal shall further take all action necessary to amend the Cardinal Stock
Plans to eliminate automatic grants or awards thereunder following the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, United shall assume the Cardinal Stock
Plans; _provided_ that such assumption shall only be with respect to the
Replacement Options and shall have no obligation to make any additional grants
or awards under the Cardinal Stock Plans other than those grants or awards
that have been made or accrued prior to the Effective Time. United shall file
a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or an effective
registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to
the shares of United Common Stock subject to such Replacement Options, shall
distribute a prospectus relating to such Form S-8, if applicable, and shall
use reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement or registration statement on Form S-8 for so long as
such Replacement Options remain outstanding.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock award granted under a
Cardinal Stock Plan (each, a " _Cardinal Stock Award_ ") that is unvested or
contingent and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully
vest and shall be converted into the right to receive, without interest, the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 6(a), and the shares of
Cardinal Common Stock subject to such Cardinal Stock Award will be treated in
the same manner as all other shares of Cardinal Common Stock for such
purposes.

7\. _Cardinal Common Stock Exchange Procedures_.

 

a. _Exchange Agent; Merger Consideration_. United shall appoint its transfer
agent, Computershare Limited, or, with the written consent of Cardinal, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, another agent independent of and
unaffiliated with United, UBV or Cardinal (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
purpose of exchanging Cardinal Certificates and Cardinal Book-Entry Shares
for the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, United shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of
the holders of Cardinal Common Stock and for exchange in accordance with this
Plan of Merger, or shall duly authorize and direct issuance by the Exchange
Agent in accordance with this Section 7 of, (i) certificates, or, at Uniteds
option, evidence of shares in book-entry form, representing the shares of
United Common Stock, and (ii) an amount of cash necessary to pay the Cash
Consideration.

 



A-4 b. _Surrender of Cardinal Certificates and Cardinal Book-Entry Shares_. United
shall cause the Exchange Agent, not later than five Business Days after the
Effective Time, to mail to each holder of one or more Cardinal Certificates or
of Cardinal Book-Entry Shares a form letter of transmittal for return to the
Exchange Agent containing instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Cardinal Certificates and Cardinal Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration into which the Cardinal Common Stock represented by such
Cardinal Certificates and Cardinal Book-Entry Shares shall have been
converted as a result of the Merger. The letter of transmittal shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Cardinal
Certificates and Cardinal Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Cardinal Certificates and Cardinal Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent. Upon proper surrender of a Cardinal Certificate or Cardinal Book-Entry
Shares for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent or compliance with
the provisions of Section 7.e, together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Cardinal Certificate or
Cardinal Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration and the Cardinal Certificate and/or Cardinal Book-
Entry Shares so surrendered shall be cancelled. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration that remains unclaimed by the holders of Cardinal Common Stock
on the business day after the one-year anniversary of the Effective Date
shall be paid to United. Any holders of Cardinal Common Stock who have not
theretofor complied with this Section 7.b. shall thereafter look only to
United for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional
shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on United Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each share of Cardinal Common Stock such stockholder
holds as determined pursuant to the Merger Agreement, in each case, without
any interest thereon. Subject to all applicable laws of escheat, such amounts
shall be paid to such former shareholder of Cardinal, without interest, upon
proper surrender of his, her or its Certificates or delivery of an affidavit
of loss as described in Section 7.e.

c. _Rounding of Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares_. All dollar amounts
payable to any shareholder as a result of the payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 6.b will be rounded to the nearest whole
cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward), based on the aggregate amount
payable for all shares registered in such shareholders name. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares or
any unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of
Certificates.

 

d. _Automatic Conversion of Cardinal Certificates and Cardinal Book-Entry
Shares_. Following the Effective Time, Cardinal Certificates and Cardinal
Book-Entry Shares that formerly represented shares of Cardinal Common Stock
that are to be converted into the United Common Stock shall be deemed for all
purposes to represent the number of whole shares of United Common Stock into
which they have been converted, except that until exchanged in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 7, the holders of such shares shall not be
entitled to receive dividends or other distributions or payments in respect of
United Common Stock.

 



A-5 e. _Lost Cardinal Certificates; Failure to Surrender Cardinal Certificates_.
If any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Cardinal
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by United, the
posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as United may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Cardinal Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Cardinal Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Cardinal Common Stock
represented by such Cardinal Certificate.

8.  _Amendment_. Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, this Plan of
Merger may be amended by the Managers of UBV and the Board of Directors
Cardinal at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any amendment made subsequent to the approval of this Plan of Merger by
the sole member of UBV, and the shareholders of United and Cardinal shall not:

 

a. alter or change the amount or kind of shares or other securities, eligible
interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or
eligible interests, cash or other property or rights to be received under this
Plan of Merger by the Cardinal shareholders;

 

b. alter or change any of the other terms or conditions of this Plan of Merger
if the change would adversely Cardinal shareholders in any material respect;
or

c. alter or change any term of the articles of incorporation of Cardinal, as
amended, or the articles of organization of UBV, as amended.

9\. _Abandonment_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Merger may be
abandoned, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, without further
shareholder action in the manner determined by the Boards of Directors of
United and Cardinal and the Managers of UBV. Written notice of such
abandonment shall be filed with the SCC prior to the Effective Time.

below) be merged (the " _Bank Merger_ ") with and into United Bank (" _United
Bank_ "), a Virginia chartered commercial bank, in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (the " _VSCA_ ")
and Title 6.2 of the Code of Virginia. As a result of the Bank Merger, the

continue unaffected and unimpaired by the Bank Merger.

 

2\. _Effective Time; Effects of the Merger_.

 

a. The Bank Merger shall become effective at the later of (i) the time and
date designated by United Bank to the Virginia Bureau of
Financial Institutions as the time and date on which the Bank Merger shall be
effective and (ii) the time and date on which the Virginia Bureau of Financial
Institutions orders the Bank Merger to be effective; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Effective Time be earlier than, or at the same
time as, the effective time of the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Cardinal
Financial Corporation, the parent company of Cardinal Bank (" _Cardinal_ "),
with and into UBV Holding Company, LLC, the parent company of United Bank ("
_UBV_ "), and wholly-owned subsidiary of United Bankshares, Inc. (" _UBSI_ ");
such time referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_."

chartered commercial bank. The business shall be conducted by the Successor
Institution at its principal office, which shall be located at the principal
office of United Bank at 1118 Main Street, Fairfax, Virginia 22030; at all
duly authorized and operating branches of United Bank and Cardinal Bank as of
the Effective Time, together with the principal office of Cardinal Bank,
which shall be operated as a branch of the Successor Institution; and at all
other offices and facilities of United Bank and Cardinal Bank established as
of the Effective Time. 

 



C-1 c. At the Effective Time, the Bank Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 13.1-721 of the VSCA. At the Effective Time, the separate existence
of Cardinal Bank shall cease and the corporate existence of United Bank, as

Bank Merger; and the Successor Institution shall be deemed to be the same
business and corporate entity as each of Cardinal Bank and United Bank. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Bank Merger and without any further act,
deed, conveyance or other transfer, all of the property, rights, powers and
franchises of Cardinal Bank and United Bank shall vest in United Bank as the
Successor Institution, and the Successor Institution shall be subject to and
be deemed to have assumed all of the debts, liabilities, obligations and
duties of Cardinal Bank and United Bank, and to have succeeded to all of the
relationships, fiduciary or otherwise, of Cardinal Bank and United Bank as
fully and to the same extent as if such property, rights, powers,
franchises, debts, liabilities, obligations, duties and relationships had
been originally acquired, incurred or entered into by the Successor
Institution; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Successor Institution shall
not, through the Bank Merger, acquire power to engage in any business or to
exercise any right, privilege or franchise which is not conferred on the
Successor Institution by the Code of Virginia or applicable regulations.

 

d. The Successor Institution, upon the consummation of the Bank Merger and
without any order or other action on the part of any court or otherwise,
shall hold and enjoy all rights of property, franchises and interests,
including appointments, designations and nominations, and all other rights and
interests as agent, trustee, executor, administrator, registrar of stocks and
bonds, guardian of estates, conservator, assignee, receiver and committee of
estates of incompetents, bailee or depository of personal property, and in
every other fiduciary and/or custodial capacity, in the same manner and to the
same extent as such rights, franchises and interests were held or enjoyed by
each of Cardinal Bank and United Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

e. The name of the Successor Institution in the Bank Merger shall be "United
Bank."

 

3\. _Manner and Basis of Converting Securities_.

therefor, and (ii) the shares of the capital stock of United Bank issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective
Time, continue to be issued and outstanding.

stock of Cardinal Bank shall thereafter not evidence any interest in Cardinal
Bank or the Successor Institution.

Effective Time.

the Successor Institution shall be comprised of those persons serving as
directors of United Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each such
Director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholder of
the Successor Institution at which directors are elected, unless sooner
removed, resigned, disqualified or deceased, and until their successors have
been elected and qualified.

5\. _Officers_. Upon the Effective Time, the officers of the Successor
Institution shall be comprised of those persons serving as officers of United

Time and shall thereafter continue in full force and effect until further

8\. _Amendment_. Subject to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger by
and between United Bank and Cardinal Bank, dated  (the "
_Bank Merger Agreement_ "), this Plan of Merger may be amended by the Boards
of Directors of United Bank and Cardinal Bank at any time prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that any amendment made subsequent to
the approval of this Plan of Merger by the shareholder of Cardinal Bank and
the shareholder of United Bank shall not:

 

a. alter or change the amount or kind of shares or other securities, eligible
interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or
eligible interests, cash or other property or rights to be received under this
Plan of Merger by such shareholders;

b. alter or change any of the other terms or conditions of this Plan of
Merger if the change would adversely affect such shareholders in any material
respect; or

 

c. alter or change any term of the Articles of Incorporation of Cardinal Bank

consummation of the Bank Merger and the parties obligations to consummate
the Bank Merger that, (i) immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have been consummated and UBV shall be the sole holder of all of the

been obtained and any waiting periods shall have expired. This Plan of Merger
may be terminated by mutual consent of Cardinal Bank and United Bank at any
time prior to the Effective Time. In addition, this Plan of Merger will

Reorganization Agreement without any action by either party hereto.

 



C-3 10\. _Abandonment_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Bank Merger
may be abandoned, subject to regulatory approval and to the terms of the Bank
Merger Agreement, without further shareholder action in the manner determined
by the Boards of Directors of United Bank and Cardinal Bank. Written notice of
such abandonment shall be filed with the Virginia State Corporation
Commission prior to the Effective Time.

11\. _Defined Term_. As used in this Plan of Merger, the " _Reorganization
Agreement_ " means the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization by and between
Cardinal and UBSI, dated August 17, 2016, pursuant to which Cardinal will be
merged with and into UBV, with UBV surviving such merger.

and warrants that: (a) Stockholder is now, and at all times until the
Effective Date of the Merger will be, the sole owner, of record or
beneficially, or possesses and will possess the sole right to vote or direct
the voting of all of the Covered Shares, and possesses or will possess the
sole power to dispose of or direct the disposition of all of Covered Shares;

Agreement may be waived, except by an instrument in writing, executed by the

exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

9\. _Defined Terms._ Capitalized terms used and not defined herein and defined
in the Reorganization Agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to them in
the Reorganization Agreement.
