Cardinal receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement providing for reasonable protection of confidential information, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person or entity with any exclusive right to negotiate
with Cardinal and shall contain terms and conditions no less favorable to Cardinal with respect to confidentiality than the Confidentiality Agreement, and (iii) the Cardinal Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal. Cardinal shall promptly notify United in writing of Cardinal&#146;s receipt of any such Acquisition Proposal or
