THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is dated and effective as of August 16,

corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent (the "Merger Sub"), and
Midwest Air Group, Inc. a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company"). A glossary
of defined terms is attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit A_.

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, the Companys Board of Directors (the "Company Board"), the Parents
managing member (the "Parent Managing Member") and the Merger Subs Board of
Directors (the "Merger Sub Board") have each determined that it is advisable
to, fair to and in the best interests of their respective shareholders and
members, as applicable, for the Merger Sub to merge with and into the Company
(the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with the WBCL; and

 

WHEREAS, the Company Board, the Parent Managing Member and the Merger Sub
Board have each approved the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and the Company Board and the Merger
Sub Board have resolved to recommend that their respective shareholders
approve and adopt this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, the Company, the Parent and the Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe various conditions to
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company, the Parent
and the Merger Sub hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1- THE MERGER

 

1.1

 

 _Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and in accordance with the WBCL and a plan of merger to be prepared
in accordance with the WBCL, at the Effective Time the Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation").

 

1.2

 

 _Closing_. The Closing shall be held at such time, date (the "Closing Date")
and location as may be mutually agreed by the Parent and the Company. In the
absence of such agreement, the Closing shall be held at the offices of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 300 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles,
California, commencing at 9:00 a.m., local time, on the fifth (5th) Business
Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7,

 


  

 

below (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions),
unless this Agreement has been theretofore terminated pursuant to Article 8,
below.

 

1.3

 

 _Effective Time_. Contemporaneously with the Closing, the parties shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing Articles of Merger (the "Articles
of Merger"), and any other required documents, with the DFI, in such form as
required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the
WBCL.

 

1.4

 

 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the
effect provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the WBCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all
of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Merger Sub
and the Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations and duties of the Merger Sub and the Company shall
become the debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

1.5

 

 _Surviving Corporation s Charter Documents_. Each of the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company shall be amended as a result of the
Merger so as to read in its entirety as the articles of incorporation and
bylaws, respectively, of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
same as the name of the Company, and the provisions in the Articles of
Incorporation of Merger Sub naming its incorporator shall be omitted and, as
so amended, shall be the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable law.

 

1.6

 

 _Surviving Corporation s Directors and Officers_. At the Effective Time,
the directors and officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Surviving
Corporations Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws.

 

1.7

 

 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without action on the part of any of the Parent, the Merger Sub, the
Company or any of their respective Boards of Directors or shareholders:

 

(a)

 

 _Conversion of Shares_. Each share of the common stock, $.01 par value, of
the Company together with the associated Preferred Share Purchase Right
("Company Common Stock" or "Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, other than (i) Shares held in the treasury of the
Company, (ii) Shares owned by the Parent, the Merger Sub or any other Parent
Subsidiary, and (iii) Shares owned by the Company (clauses (i) through (iii)
hereof, collectively, "Excluded Shares"), shall cease to be outstanding and
shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $17.00
(the "Per Share Consideration").

 

(b)

 

 _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

 


  

 

2

 



 

(c)

 

 _Conversion of Merger Sub Shares_. Each outstanding share of capital stock
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into one share of capital
stock, of the same class and series, of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. Each outstanding option, warrant or other instrument or security
of the Merger Sub which is convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable
for shares of capital stock of the Merger Sub and is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be
converted into an option, warrant or other instrument or security with the
same terms and that is convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, of the same class and
series. The Articles of Merger shall specifically provide that all classes
and series of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be treated at the Effective
Time as provided in this Section 1.7. _ _

 

1.8

 

 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a)

 

 _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with the bank or trust company designated by
the Parent as the paying agent (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article
1, through the Paying Agent, cash in an amount equal to the aggregate Per
Share Consideration (the "Exchange Fund"). The Paying Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed in writing by the Parent; provided, however, that
such investments shall only be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations receiving the highest
rating from Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation
or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument
shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months from the date of issuance (it
being understood that any and all interest or income earned on the Exchange
Fund shall be remitted and allocable to the Parent). If there are losses with
respect to investments of the Exchange Fund, or the cash maintained in the
Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make
prompt payment of the aggregate Per Share Consideration as contemplated
herein, the Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange
Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to satisfy the
aggregate Per Share Consideration.

 

(b)

 

 _Surrender Procedures_. Within five (5) days after the Effective Time, the
Parent shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective
Time, of certificates representing outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
("Company Certificates") or shares of Company Common Stock represented by
book-entry ("Company Book-Entry Shares") (in each case, other than Excluded
Shares), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of Company Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in
the case of Company Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set
forth in the letter of transmittal) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Company Certificates or, in the case of Company Book-Entry
Shares, the surrender of such shares for payment of the Per Share
Consideration therefor. After the

 


  

 

3

 



 

Effective Time, upon surrender in accordance with this Section 1.8(b) to the
Paying Agent of Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the Paying Agent shall
promptly deliver to the holder of such Company Certificates or Company Book-
Entry Shares in exchange therefor, the Per Share Consideration to be received
by the holder thereof pursuant to this Agreement. The Paying Agent shall
accept Company Certificates and Company Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect
an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of
the Company or its transfer agent of shares of Company Common Stock and, if
Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Company
for transfer, they shall be canceled against delivery of the Per Share
Consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.8.
If the Per Share Consideration is to be issued in a name other than that in
which a Company Certificate surrendered for exchange or Company Book-Entry
Share is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that either (i)
such Company Certificate shall be properly endorsed, with signature
guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Company Book-
Entry Share shall be properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such
exchange or payment shall pay to the Company or its transfer agent or as
otherwise directed any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Per Share Consideration in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Company Certificate surrendered or such Company Book-
Entry Share, or establish to the satisfaction of the Parent that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 1.8(b), each Company Certificate and each Company Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Per Share Consideration as
contemplated by Section 1.7, above.

 

(c)

 

 _No Further Rights in the Shares_. The Per Share Consideration paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article 1 shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares so
exchanged.

 

(d)

 

 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the former shareholders of the Company for twelve
(12) consecutive months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Parent, upon demand, and any former shareholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this Section 1.8 shall thereafter look only to the
Parent and the Surviving Corporation to claim the Per Share Consideration owed
to them hereunder, without interest thereon.

 

(e)

 

 _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the
Parent nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any
cash or other payment delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 


  

 

4

 



 

(f)

 

 _Withholding Rights_. The Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Per Share Consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Parent or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of applicable Law, and the Parent and the
Paying Agent shall timely pay over such withheld amounts to the appropriate
Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

(g)

 

 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificate_. If any Company Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if requested by the Parent, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Certificate, the Per Share Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Shares represented by such Company Certificate.

 

1.9

 

 _Adjustments for Dilution and Other Matters_. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, there is a recapitalization,
reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, combination or
exchange of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, the Shares
(each, an "Adjustment"), the Per Share Consideration shall be adjusted
accordingly, without duplication, to provide the holders of Shares with the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
Adjustment.

 

ARTICLE 2- REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except (i) as set forth in the corresponding section of the disclosure letter
delivered to the Parent and the Merger Sub by the Company prior to entering
into this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), it being understood
that matters disclosed pursuant to one section of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any other section of the
Company Disclosure Letter where it is reasonably apparent that the matters so
disclosed are applicable to such other section, and (ii) to the extent set
forth in the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof (excluding any
risk factor disclosures contained in such documents and any disclosure of any
risks included in any "forward-looking statement" or related disclaimer or
other statements that are similarly non-specific and are predictive or
forward-looking in nature) if the relevance of such disclosure as an exception
to a representation or warranty is reasonably apparent, the Company hereby
represents and warrants to the Parent and the Merger Sub that:

 

2.1

 

 _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. The Company and each
Company Subsidiary is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing or active status, as the case may be, under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and
is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation
in each jurisdiction where the ownership or leasing of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such

 


  

 

5

 



 

qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing,
qualified or in good standing or active status, or to have such power or
authority, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to the Parent complete and
correct copies of the Companys Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and the
organizational documents of each Company Subsidiary, each as amended to date.

 

2.2

 

 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
50,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of no par value
preferred stock, 250,000 of which shares have been designated as Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock and reserved for issuance with the
Preferred Share Purchase Rights (the "Series A Preferred Stock" and, together
with any other series, the "Company Preferred Stock"). As of August 10, 2007,
(i) 25,120,591 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all
of which were duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non assessable,
subject to the personal liability which may be imposed on shareholders by
former Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the WBCL for debts incurred prior to June 14,
2006 (for debts incurred on or after such date, Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the
WBCL has been repealed) owing to employees for services performed, but not
exceeding six (6) months service in any one case, and not issued in violation
of any preemptive or similar right of any shareholder of the Company or any
other Person, and no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding, (ii) 708,667 shares of Company Common Stock and no shares of
Company Preferred Stock were held in the treasury of the Company, (iii)
2,403,230 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to, and were reserved
for issuance upon exercise of, outstanding stock options (each, a "Company
Option") and issued pursuant to the Companys stock option and equity
incentive plans (each, a "Company Option Plan"), (iv) 104,031 shares of
Company Common Stock were subject to, and were reserved for issuance upon
exercise of, outstanding warrants (each, a "Company Warrant"), and (v) 417,153
shares of Company Common Stock were subject to restricted stock award
agreements (each, a "Company Restricted Award"). Since the close of business
on August 10, 2007 to the date of this Agreement, no Shares, shares of Company
Preferred Stock, Company Options, Company Warrants, or Company Restricted
Awards have been issued by the Company, except Shares issued pursuant to the
exercise of Company Options. The Company has made available to the Parent
complete and correct copies of each Company Option Plan, form of option
agreement evidencing any Company Option, Company Warrant and Company
Restricted Award. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Options, Company Warrants and Company Restricted Awards have
been issued in compliance with all applicable federal and state securities
laws or in accordance with exemptions therefrom, except for such violations
that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Except for the Preferred Share Purchase Rights, the Company Options,
the Company Warrants and the Company Restricted Awards, there are no
outstanding Rights to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party
relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other equity interests of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. There are no obligations
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or the capital stock or other
equity interests of any Company Subsidiary or to provide funds to or make any
investment in any Company Subsidiary or any other Person. At the Effective
Time, each Company Warrant shall be cancelled and shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the consideration set forth in Section 6.13 hereof. 

 


  

 

6

 



 

Section 2.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter lists, as of August 1, 2007, the
outstanding Company Options and Company Warrants and the exercise prices
thereof.

 

2.3

 

 _Subsidiaries_. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each
Company Subsidiary that is a corporation have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, subject to the personal liability
which may be imposed on shareholders by former Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the
WBCL for debts incurred prior to June 14, 2006 (for debts incurred on or after
such date, Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the WBCL has been repealed) owing to
employees for services performed, but not exceeding six (6) months service in
any one case, and were not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar
right of any shareholder of the Company or any other Person. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of each Company
Subsidiary are owned by the Company, by one or more Company Subsidiaries or by
the Company and one or more Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens
(other than restrictions on transfer imposed by applicable federal and state
securities laws). No shares of preferred stock of any Company Subsidiary are
issued and outstanding. Except for the capital stock and other equity
interests of the Company Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock or other ownership interest in any Person.

 

2.4

The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and
the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are within the Companys corporate powers and, except for

Merger in accordance with the WBCL, have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize

transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles.

any of the Company Subsidiaries with, nor are any consents, registrations,
approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained, or any actions
required to be taken, by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries from,
as applicable, any Governmental Authority or other Person in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, except for (i) filings relating to and the approval of,

Incorporation or By-Laws or the comparable governing documents of any of the
Company Subsidiaries, or (ii) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a
breach or violation of, a termination or default under, the creation or
acceleration of any obligations under or the creation of a Lien on any of the
assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to, (x) any
Contract binding upon the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or (y)
any material Law to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is
subject or any Company License; except in the case of clause (ii)(x), above,
for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration
or change that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

2.6

 

 _Company Reports; Financial Statements_. 

 

(a)

 

The Company and each Company Subsidiary has filed all forms, reports and
documents required to be filed with the SEC (collectively, the "Company
Reports") since December 31, 2004. The Company Reports, including all Company
Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, (i) were or will be prepared
in accordance with the requirements of applicable Law and (ii) did not at the
time they were filed, or will not at the time they are filed, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(b)

 

Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any
related notes thereto) contained in the Company Reports, including any Company
Reports filed after the date of this Agreement and prior to or on the
Effective Time, have been or will be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and

 


  

 

8

 



 

each fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows
and changes in financial position for the periods indicated, except that any
unaudited interim financial statements do not contain the notes required by
GAAP and were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments,
which were not or are not expected to be material in amount, either
individually or in the aggregate.

 

(c)

 

The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures"
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are
reasonably designed to ensure that material information (both financial and
non-financial) relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries required
to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer
and the principal financial officer of the Company required by Section 302 of
Sarbanes-Oxley with respect to such reports. For purposes of this Agreement,
" principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have
the meanings given to such terms in Sarbanes-Oxley.

 

(d)

 

The Company has established and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) ("internal controls"). To the Knowledge of the Company, such
internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of the
Companys financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal
controls prior to the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and audit
committee (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses known to
the Company in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in a material respect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any material fraud known to the Company that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in internal controls. The Company has
made available to the Parent a summary of any such disclosure regarding
material weaknesses and fraud made by management to the Companys auditors and
audit committee since December 31, 2004. For purposes of this Agreement, a
"significant deficiency" in controls means an internal control deficiency that
adversely affects an entitys ability to initiate, authorize, record, process,
or report external financial data reliably in accordance with GAAP. A
"significant deficiency" may be a single deficiency or a combination of
deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement
of the annual or interim financial statements that is more than
inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "material weakness" in internal controls means a significant
deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more
than a remote likelihood that

 


  

 

9

 



 

a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected.

 

2.7

 

 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2006, (i) there has not
been any Company Material Adverse Effect and (ii) the business of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries has been conducted in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice and neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiaries have taken any actions that would have been prohibited pursuant
Sections 4.2(a), (c), (d), (i), (j), (l), (m), (n), (q) and (r) if such
covenant had been in effect as of December 31, 2006. 

 

2.8

 

 _Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in Section 2.8 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise), other than liabilities and obligations (i) set forth
in the Companys consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31,
2006 included in the Company Reports (or in the notes thereto), (ii) incurred
in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2006, (iii) incurred in
connection with the Merger or any other transaction or agreement contemplated
by this Agreement, (iv) for future performance under any Contracts to which
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or bound that were
entered into in the ordinary course of business or are listed in any section
of the Company Disclosure Letter, (v) that are expressly within the scope of
another representation or warranty in this Article 2, and (vi) that have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

2.9

 

 _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in Section 2.9 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that would
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or
challenge, prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries is subject to or bound by any outstanding Order that
would reasonably be expected to (i) result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect or (ii) prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

applicable Law, and (ii) all employer or employee contributions, premiums and

to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, except as disclosed in
Section 2.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

 

(c)

 

As of the date of this Agreement, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened Proceedings involving a Company Benefit Plan (other
than routine claims for benefits payable under any such Company Benefit Plan)
that would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(d)

 

Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended by its terms to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the IRS to be so qualified,
a timely application for such determination is now pending or is not yet
required to be filed or the Company or the Company ERISA Affiliate has duly
adopted a prototype plan and is relying on the opinion letter for such
prototype plan, and, except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect, each such Company Benefit Plan is qualified
in operation. Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any of the Company
ERISA Affiliates has any liability or obligation under any welfare plan or
agreement to provide benefits after termination of employment to any employee
or dependent other than as required by Section 4980B of the Code or applicable
Law or the terms of a separation or retention plan or agreement.

the Code.

are not being, conducted in violation of any applicable operating
certificates, common carrier obligations, airworthiness directives ("Ads"),
Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") or any other rules, regulations,
directives or policies of the FAA, DOT, FCC, DHS or any other Governmental
Authority, except for such violations that would not reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review by
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor
has any Governmental Authority indicated an intention to conduct the same,
except for any such investigations or reviews that would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company

to be complied with in accordance with the FAA-approved maintenance program of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries are in compliance with such maintenance schedules and currently
have no reason to believe that they will not satisfy any component of such
maintenance schedules on or prior to the dates specified in such maintenance
schedules, except, in each case, for such instances of noncompliance as would
not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b)

to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any
of the Company Subsidiaries has received any notice of any proposed withdrawal

Company Slots have been filed in a timely manner, except for such failures to
so file as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has
agreed to any trade, purchase, sale or other transfer of any of the Company
Slots.

obligations under any such insurance policy, except as would not be reasonably
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. The insurance

any (i) cancellation or invalidation of any material

without any further action on the part of the holders of Company Common Stock

ARTICLE 3- REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARENT AND 
 THE MERGER SUB

 

Except as expressly contemplated or permitted under this Agreement, the Parent
and the Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company that:

 

3.1

 

 _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. The Parent and each Parent
Subsidiary is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing or active status, as the case may be, under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to carry on its business as presently
conducted.

 

3.2

 

 _Capitalization of Merger Sub; Operations of Parent and Merger Sub_. As of
the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of the Merger Sub consists
solely of 1,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of
which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of the Merger Sub is owned by the Parent or a Parent Subsidiary.
Neither the Parent nor the Merger Sub has conducted any business prior to the
date hereof and neither the Parent nor the Merger Sub has, and prior to the
Effective Time will not have any, assets (except, with respect to the Parent,
the common stock of the Merger Sub), liabilities or obligations of any nature
other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

3.3

 

 _Authority; Approval_. The execution, delivery and performance by the Parent
and the Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by the Parent and
the Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
are within the Parents limited liability company powers and the Merger Subs
corporate powers and, except for the filing and recordation of the Articles of
Merger in accordance with the WBCL, have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary limited liability company and corporate action on the part of
the Parent and the Merger Sub and no other limited liability company or
corporate proceedings on the part of the Parent or the Merger Sub are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Parent and the Merger Sub and, assuming that this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Parent and the
Merger Sub, enforceable against the Parent and the Merger Sub in accordance
with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles.

 

3.4

 

 _Third Party Consents; No Violations_. 

 

(a)

 

No notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by the Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries with, nor are any consents, registrations,
approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained by the Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries from, as applicable, any Governmental Authority
or other Person in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Parent and the Merger Sub and the consummation by the
Parent and the Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, except for (i) filings relating to

 


  

 

20

 



 

and the approval of, or expiration or termination of the statutory waiting
periods relating to, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
under the HSR Act, and those that the failure to make or obtain would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) notification to
the DOT of the change in control of the Companys Subsidiaries and such
filings as the DOT might require with respect to the international operating
authority of the Company Subsidiaries.

 

(b)

 

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Parent and
the Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by the Parent and the Merger Sub
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not,
constitute or result in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the
Parents Certificate of Formation or Limited Liability Company Agreement or
the comparable governing documents of any of the Parent Subsidiaries, or (ii)
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a
termination or default under, the creation or acceleration of any obligations
under or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Contract binding upon the Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries or any Law to which the Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries is subject; except in the case of clause (ii) above, for
any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or
change that would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair
or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

3.5

 

 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Proceeding pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Parent, threatened against the Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
impair or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither the Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is subject
to or bound by any outstanding Order that would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

3.6

 

 _Proxy Statement_. The information supplied by the Parent and the Merger Sub
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement shall not,
at the date the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto) is first mailed to shareholders or at the time of the Shareholders
Meeting, be false or misleading with respect to any material fact required to
be stated therein, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent and
the Merger Sub make no representation or warranty with respect to any
information about, or supplied or omitted by, the Company which is contained
in any of the foregoing documents.

 

3.7

 

 _Financing Commitments._ Parent has delivered to the Company true and
complete copies of executed commitment letters from each Equity Provider to
provide equity financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein (the "Equity
Funding Letters" and such investment referred to as the "Financing"). As of
the date hereof, no amendment or modification of the Equity Funding Letters is
contemplated, and the respective commitments contained in such letters have
not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. The Parent or the Merger Sub
has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with
the Equity Funding Letters that are

 


  

 

21

 



 

payable on or prior to the date hereof and the Equity Funding Letters are in
full force and effect and are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations
of the Parent and the Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set
forth in or expressly contemplated by the Equity Funding Letters. Assuming
the Financing is funded and assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 2.2 and compliance by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries with the agreements set forth in Section 4.1 and Section
4.2, the net proceeds contemplated by the Equity Funding Letters will in the
aggregate be sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay
the Merger Consideration and any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default on the part of the Parent or the Merger
Sub under the Equity Funding Letters, and, as of the date of this Agreement,
the Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to
the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be
available to the Parent or the Merger Sub on the date of the Closing.

 

3.8

 

 _Brokers and Finders_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that, if the Merger is not
consummated, would be payable by the Company, based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of the Parent or the Merger Sub.

 

3.9

 

 _U.S. Citizen_. As of the Closing Date, each of the Parent and Merger Sub
will be a "citizen of the United States" as defined in the Aviation Act.

26

 



 

previously provided to the Parent. The Company shall promptly advise the
Parent orally and in writing of the receipt by the Company of any Takeover
Proposal made with respect to, or of any request made to the Company for
information or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to result in, any
Takeover Proposal (in each case within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt
thereof), and the Company shall provide to the Parent (within such twenty-four
(24) hour time frame), at the Companys option, either (i) a copy of any such
Takeover Proposal made in writing provided to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (which, at the option of the Company, may be redacted
solely to remove the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the
Takeover Proposal) or (ii) a written summary of the material terms of such
Takeover Proposal (it being understood that such material terms do not have to

(c)

 

Except as set forth in Sections 4.3(d) and 4.3(e), below, neither the Company

or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw (or not continue to make) or modify
in a manner adverse to the Parent, the Recommendation; (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal
(any of the actions referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), whether

Recommendation"); or (iii) allow the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or any similar agreement or understanding (other than a
Qualifying Confidentiality Agreement) to implement a Takeover Proposal (each,
an "Acquisition Agreement").

 

(d)

 

Notwithstanding Section 4.3(c), above, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Requisite Vote, if the Company (i) has received a proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to the terms of any
revised offer by the Parent pursuant to this Section 4.3(d)), (ii) has
determined, in consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take the
actions set forth in clause (x) or (y) below would be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (iii) has not
breached the provisions of this Section 4.3; the Company Board may, after
complying with the provisions of clauses (i) and (ii) below, (x) in connection
with such Superior Proposal, make a Change of Recommendation or (y) after
complying with all of the applicable provisions of Section 8.3 and subject to
the proviso below, terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1
(and concurrently with such termination cause the Company to enter into an
Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Superior Proposal); provided that
the Company Board may not take the action set forth in clause (x) or (y), as
the case may be, unless:

 


  

 

27

 



 

(i)

 

the Company shall have provided prior written notice to the Parent at least
five (5) calendar days in advance (the "Notice Period") of its intention to
take such action, which notice shall attach the most recent draft of any
agreement with respect to, and specify the terms and conditions of any such
Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making the Superior Proposal) and any material modifications to any of the
foregoing, and

 

(ii)

 

during the Notice Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial
advisors and outside counsel to, negotiate with the Parent in good faith (to
the extent the Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases
to constitute (in the judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with
the Company Financial Advisor and with outside counsel), a Superior Proposal.

 

If during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal
and the Company Board in its good faith judgment determines such revisions are
material (it being understood that any change in the purchase price or form of
consideration in such Superior Proposal shall be deemed a material revision),
the Company shall deliver a new written notice to the Parent and shall comply
with the requirements of this Section 4.3(d) with respect to such new written
notice, except that the new Notice Period shall be three (3) calendar days.

 

(e)

 

Notwithstanding Section 4.3(c), above, at any time prior to the Company
Requisite Vote, the Company Board may, other than in response to a Takeover
Proposal, make a Change of Recommendation if the Company Board has determined
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that, based on events
and circumstances which are material, not reasonably foreseeable (or foreseen)
at the date of this Agreement, and outside of the Companys control, the
failure of the Company Board to make such Change of Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to
the Companys shareholders under applicable Law, provided, that the Company
Board may not make such Change of Recommendation unless prior thereto the
Company shall take the actions set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) of
Section 4.3(d), above, as if a Superior Proposal had been received by the
Company.

 

(f)

 

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) from (i) informing any Person of the
existence of the provisions contained in this Section 4.3, (ii) complying with
Rules 14a-9, 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iii) making
any disclosure to the Companys shareholders if, in the case of this clause
(iii), in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (or any committee
thereof), after consultation with outside counsel, the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to
the Companys shareholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(x) any disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" letter or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Company Board
expressly publicly reaffirms its Recommendation at least two business days
prior to the Shareholders Meeting if the Parent has delivered to the Company
a written request to so reaffirm at least 48 hours (or if 48 hours is
impracticable, as far in advance as is practicable) prior to the time such

 


  

 

28

 



 

reaffirmation is requested to be made and (y) neither the Company nor the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend that
the Companys shareholders tender any securities in connection with any tender
or exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any Takeover
Proposal), unless in each case, in connection therewith, the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) effects a Change of Recommendation in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

 

4.4

 

 _Access and Information_. Upon reasonable notice and subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreements, the Company shall, and the Company shall cause
each of the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to the Parent and the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the Parent
reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all of the Companys and any Company Subsidiarys material
properties, books, Contracts, records, employees and agents; provided,
however, that such access shall only be provided to the extent that such
access would not violate applicable Law; and provided, further, that the
foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that violates any of the Companys obligations with
respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third Person to such
inspection or disclosure, (ii) to disclose any privileged information of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (provided that the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to enter into a joint defense or similar agreement to
prevent the loss of any such privilege), or (iii) to permit invasive testing
of any of the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys real property. All
requests for information made pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall be directed
to the Companys General Counsel. In no event shall the Company be required
to supply to the Parent, or the Parents officers, employees, accountants,
counsel or other representatives, any information relating to indications of
interest from, or discussions with, any other potential acquirors of the
Company, except to the extent necessary for use in the Proxy Statement or as
required under Section 4.3, above. In the event this Agreement is terminated
for any reason, the Parent shall, in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreements, return or destroy, or cause to be returned or
destroyed, all nonpublic information obtained from the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries and any copies made of such documents for the Parent.

after taking into account any comments made by the Parent) and file with the
SEC the proxy statement to be sent to the shareholders of the Company in
connection with the Shareholders Meeting (such proxy statement as amended or
supplemented is referred to herein as the "Proxy Statement") relating to the
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, by the shareholders of the Company. Each of the Company and the

the other filings shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in

amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the
SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the

above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or making the other
filings (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding
to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide the
Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and
shall include in such document or response comments reasonably proposed by the
Parent.

The Company, the Parent and the Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best
efforts to, as applicable (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) obtain all Licenses required under
applicable Law (including all rulings and approvals of Governmental
Authorities) as a result of consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger (collectively, "Governmental Licenses"),
(iii) obtain all Consents required under material Contracts to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound
(collectively, "Company Consents"), (iv) obtain all Consents required under
material Contracts to which the Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a
party or by which it is bound (collectively, "Parent Consents"), and (v) make
all necessary notices, reports, filings and registrations, and thereafter make
any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger
required under applicable Law (including the filings and other submissions, if
any, required under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) (collectively,
"Governmental Filings"); provided, that the Parent, the Merger Sub and the
Company shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all
Governmental Filings, including providing copies of all such documents to the
non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing (provided, that, in certain
circumstances, such filings may be made available only to outside counsel of
the non-filing party with a mutually acceptable agreement that such
information may not be shared with the nonfiling party) and, if requested, to
accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Parent and Merger Sub shall
not be required to make a change in the identity of its members or a material
change in the terms of its members investment in the Parent in connection
with obtaining any such approval and (ii) the Company shall not (and shall not
permit any Company Subsidiary to) pay any consent fee, waive any material
rights, materially amend the terms of any Contract or agree to hold separate
or dispose of any assets or make any material changes to the operations or
business of the Company or the Parent or any of their respective Affiliates,
or commit to do any of the foregoing, in connection with obtaining any
Governmental Licenses or Company Consents or in connection with any
Governmental Filings, in each case without the prior written consent of the
Parent in its sole discretion. The Company and the Parent shall furnish all
information required for any Governmental Filing to be made pursuant to the
rules and regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b)

 

Each of the Parent and the Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that its
obligations under this Agreement are not conditioned upon the receipt by the
Parent or

 


  

 

31

 



 

the Merger Sub of the proceeds of the Equity Funding Letters and that any
failure by the Parent or the Merger Sub to have available at the time the
conditions to its obligations to effect the Merger set forth in Article 7,
below, are satisfied or capable of satisfaction by action taken at the Closing
all funds contemplated by the Equity Funding Letters shall constitute an
intentional and willful breach by the Parent and the Merger Sub of this
Agreement.

 

6.4

 

 _Employee Benefit Matters_. _Annex A_ attached hereto sets forth certain
agreements of the parties with respect to the manner in which various benefit
and compensation matters will be handled prior to and after the Effective Time
for employees and directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The
provisions of this Section 6.4 (including Annex A) are solely for the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement, no current or former employee or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded as a third party beneficiary
of this Agreement except as provided in Section 9.7, below, and nothing herein
shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment or construed as an amendment
to any Company Benefit Plan for any purpose.

 

6.5

 

 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a)

 

For a period of not less than six (6) consecutive years immediately after the
Effective Time, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the Parent shall
cause its Certificate of Formation and Limited Liability Company Agreement and
the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws (or equivalent organizational
documents) of the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to the exculpation from
personal liability and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to
directors, officers and employees than are set forth in the Companys Articles
of Incorporation and By-Laws (or equivalent organizational documents of the
relevant Company Subsidiary) as in effect on the date hereof; provided,
however, that if any claim or claims are asserted against any individual
entitled to the protections of such provisions within such six (6) year
period, such provisions shall not be modified until the final disposition of
any such claims. The Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
indemnify and advance expenses to, and shall itself indemnify and advance
expenses as if it were the Surviving Corporation to, each present and former
director, officer and employee and employee benefit plan fiduciary (each, an
"Indemnified Person") of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
(including rights relating to advancement of expenses and indemnification
rights to which such individuals are entitled because they are serving as a
director, officer or employee of another entity at the request of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries) in respect of actions, omissions or events
occurring prior to or on the Effective Time to the fullest extent provided in
the Companys Articles of Incorporation or By-laws or the organizational
documents of any Company Subsidiary, as applicable, any indemnification
agreement or under applicable Laws, in each case, as in effect on the date of
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, if
any Indemnified Person becomes involved in any actual or threatened Proceeding
covered by this Section 6.5 after the Effective Time, the Parent shall, or the
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, to promptly advance to such Indemnified Person his or her
legal or other expenses (including the cost of any

 


  

 

32

 



 

investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject to
such Indemnified Person providing the Parent with an undertaking to reimburse
all amounts so advanced in the event of a non-appealable determination of a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled
thereto; provided, that such obligation on the part of the Parent shall cease
after the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time except with respect to
any Proceeding covered by this Section 6.5 made or filed on or prior to the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time.

 

(b)

 

At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, as of the
Effective Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i)
the Side A coverage part (directors and officers liability) of the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys
existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) consecutive years from and
after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, "DandO Insurance") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits
of liability that are at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies
with respect to any matter claimed against a director or officer of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in
such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
(6) consecutive years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and the
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO
Insurance for such six (6) year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; provided, however, that in
no event shall the Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance; and provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

 

(c)

 

If the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or shall cease to continue to exist
for any reason or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.5.

 


  

 

33

 



 

(d)

 

The provisions of this Section 6.5 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person and his or her heirs,
personal representatives or similar representatives, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall
not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Persons
(including their successors, assigns and heirs) without the express written
consent of the Indemnified Person (including the successors, assigns and
heirs) affected thereby.

 

6.6

 

 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
is intended to give the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary as relates to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or vice versa, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the other partys or its Subsidiarys operations
prior to the Effective Time.

 

6.7

 

 _Transfer Taxes_. The Company and the Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, and transfer,
recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes that become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(together with any related interest, penalties or additions to Tax, "Transfer
Taxes"). All Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation and
expressly shall not be a liability of any shareholder of the Company.

 

6.8

 

 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable
Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock resulting from the
transactions contemplated hereby, by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

6.9

 

 _Confidentiality Agreements_. The Company and the Parent acknowledge and
agree that the Confidentiality Agreements dated August 1, 2007 between an
Affiliate of the Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreements")
shall remain in full force and effect and be binding upon the Company and the
Parent and shall survive termination of this Agreement for the period set
forth therein.

 

6.10

 

 _[Intentionally Omitted.]_

 

6.11

 

 _Public Announcements_. The Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to the Merger and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by applicable Law, including disclosures required under the
federal securities laws.

 

6.12

 

 _Notification of Certain Matters_. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, the Company and the Parent shall promptly notify
each other in writing promptly after (a) becoming aware of (i) the occurrence,
or non-occurrence, of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any party
to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

 


  

 

34

 



 

Agreement not to be satisfied, or (ii) the failure of such party to comply
with any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it pursuant to this
Agreement which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied, (b) receiving any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or other transactions
contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or (c) any
Proceeding is commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to
the Merger; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 6.12 shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty
requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to either party,
and the failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any of the
conditions set forth in Article 7, below; and provided, further, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.12 shall not cause the
failure of any condition set forth in Article 7, below, to be satisfied nor
shall the delivery of any such notice be deemed an admission that any
condition in Article 7, below, is not or will not be satisfied or that there
has been any Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

6.13

 

 _Options; Warrants; Restricted Stock_. 

 

(a)

 

Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Option to purchase Shares
under any Company Option Plan or other agreement of the Company (including
options issued to the Companys non-employee directors) outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not currently exercisable
as provided under the terms thereof, shall become, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, exercisable. As of the Effective Time, unless otherwise
provided in any Company Option Plan, each Company Option shall be converted
into the right to receive, upon exercise, cash consideration (without interest
thereon) in an amount equal to (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option being exercised and (y)
the excess, if any, of the Per Share Consideration over the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock subject to such exercised Company Option minus
(ii) all applicable federal, state and local Taxes required to be withheld, if
any. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain the written consent (in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Parent) of each holder of Company Options that are not
exercised prior to the Effective Time (including Company Options that vest
immediately prior to the Effective Time) to the cancellation of all
outstanding Company Options held by each such holder in exchange for cash
consideration equal to (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option minus (ii) all applicable federal, state and local Taxes required to be
withheld, if any.

 

(b)

 

Unless otherwise agreed between the Parent and any holder of a Company Warrant
prior to the Effective Time (but in case of such agreement, only with respect
to such Company Warrants held by such holder), the Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that, at the Effective Time, each Company Warrant
then outstanding,

 


  

 

35

 



 

whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled by the Company
in consideration for which the holder thereof shall thereupon be entitled to
receive promptly after the Effective Time, a cash payment in respect of such
cancellation from the Company in an amount (if any) equal to (i) the product
of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Warrant, and (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Warrant minus (ii) all applicable federal, state and local Taxes required to
be withheld, if any.

 

(c)

 

The Company (acting through the Company Board or any committee thereof
administering the applicable Company Option Plan) shall take all necessary
actions to ensure that all unvested Company Restricted Awards vest immediately
prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the Company Restricted
Awards shall be converted into the right to receive an amount equal to (i) the
product of (x) the Per Share Consideration and (y) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Award minus (ii) all
applicable federal, state and local Taxes required to be withheld, if any.
Payment of such amount shall be payment in full for all Company Restricted
Awards and the Shares into which they so convert.

 

(d)

 

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the holders of
Company Options and Company Warrants appropriate notices, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Parent, setting forth such holders
rights pursuant to this Agreement. The Company shall take all action as is
necessary prior to the Effective Time to terminate all Company Option Plans so
that at and after the Effective Time, no current or former employee, director,
consultant or other person shall have any option to purchase or right to
receive any Company Options for his or her benefit, except to the extent
provided in Section 6.13(a), above. Not more than ten (10) nor less than
three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Effective Time, the Company
shall deliver to the Parent a list, in form reasonably acceptable to the
Parent, of the number of Company Options and Company Warrants expected to be
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the names of the
holders thereof and in each case together with the applicable mailing
addresses, tax identification numbers and other information relating to such
holders and participants as the Parent may reasonably require in connection
with the payments to be made pursuant to this Section 6.13. The Parent may
take such actions, as promptly as practicable, prior to making any payment
under this Section 6.13, as are reasonably necessary and appropriate in order
to verify the right of any person to receive such a payment hereunder, the
identifying information relating to such person and whether any withholding is
required with respect thereto and, if so, the amount thereof.

 

6.14

 

 _Resignation of Directors_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause each of its directors and, if requested by the Parent,
each director of each Company Subsidiary (or person fulfilling a similar role)
to resign (or otherwise to be removed) from such board of directors (or
equivalent body).

 

6.15

 

 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price", "moratorium", "business
combination", "control share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover
statute or regulation shall become applicable to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement after the date

 


  

 

36

 



 

of this Agreement, each of the Company and the Parent and member of their
respective boards of directors (or similar governing bodies) shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

 _Company Requisite Vote_. The Company Requisite Vote shall have been
obtained.

 

(b)

 

 _Governmental Licenses_. All Governmental Licenses shall have been obtained
other than any Governmental Licenses the failure of which to obtain both (i)
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and
(ii) would not subject any Person to risk of criminal liability.

 

(c)

 

 _Governmental Filings_. All Governmental Filings shall have been made and
all statutory or regulatory waiting periods applicable thereto, if any, shall
have expired or been earlier terminated other than any Governmental Filings
the failure of which to make both (i) would not reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect and (ii) would not subject any Person to

ARTICLE 8- TERMINATION

 

8.1

 

 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether prior to or after the Company Requisite Vote is
obtained (except as noted), as applicable:

 

(a)

 

by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Parent Managing Member and
the Company Board;

 

(b)

 

by either the Company or the Parent if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by February 28, 2008, unless extended by agreement of the Company
and the Parent; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose action or
failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the
Merger to occur on or before such date if such action or failure to act
constitutes a breach of any provision of this Agreement;

 


  

 

39

 



 

(c)

 

by either the Company or the Parent if a Governmental Authority shall have
issued a non-appealable final Order or taken any other action having the
effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Merger;

 

(d)

 

by either the Company or the Parent if: (i) the Shareholders Meeting
(including any adjournments thereof) shall have been held and completed and
the shareholders of the Company shall have taken a final vote on a proposal to
adopt this Agreement and (ii) the Company Requisite Vote shall not have been
obtained;

 

(e)

 

by the Company, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the
Parent or the Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation
or warranty of the Parent or the Merger Sub shall have been untrue when made
or shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth
in Sections 7.3(a) or 7.3(b), above, as the case may be, would not be
satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation
or warranty shall have become untrue, provided, that if such inaccuracy in the
Parents or the Merger Subs representations and warranties or breach by the
Parent or the Merger Sub of a covenant or agreement was unintentional and is
curable by the Parent or the Merger Sub through exercise of commercially
reasonable efforts, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.1(e) for ten (10) consecutive days after delivery of written
notice from the Company to the Parent of such breach, so long as the Parent or
the Merger Sub, as the case may be, continues to exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it being understood that the Company
may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) if such
breach by the Parent or the Merger Sub is cured during such ten (10) day
period); provided, that the Company cannot terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this clause (e) if it has breached this Agreement at or prior to the time
of termination and such breach has not been cured;

 

(f)

 

by the Parent, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the
Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of
the Company shall have been untrue when made or shall have become untrue, in
either case such that the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b),
above, as the case may be, would not be satisfied as of the time of such
breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have become
untrue, provided, that if such inaccuracy in the Companys representations and
warranties or breach by the Company of a covenant or agreement was
unintentional and is curable by the Company through exercise of its
commercially reasonable efforts, then the Parent may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) for ten (10) consecutive days after
delivery of written notice from the Parent to the Company of such breach, so
long as the Company continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
cure such breach (it being understood that the Parent may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) if such breach by the Company is
cured during such ten (10) day period); provided, that the Parent cannot
terminate the Agreement pursuant to this clause (f) if it has breached this
Agreement at or prior to the time of termination and such breach has not been
cured;

 

(g)

 

by the Parent prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote in the event of a
Change of Recommendation pursuant to Sections 4.3(d) or 4.3(e), above (or a

 


  

 

40

 



 

deemed Change of Recommendation pursuant to Section 4.3(f) above), or if the
Company Board fails to include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or to
publicly reaffirm the Recommendation within two (2) days of Parents request
that it do so; or

 

(h)

 

by the Company prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote pursuant to, and
in accordance with, Section 4.3(d), above.

 

8.2

 

 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any termination of this
Agreement under Section 8.1, above, will be effective immediately upon (or if
termination is pursuant to Sections 8.1(e) or 8.1(f), above, and the proviso
therein is applicable, ten (10) consecutive days after) the delivery of
written notice thereof by the terminating party to the other party. In the
event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, above, this
Agreement shall be of no further force or effect, with no liability of any
party to the other parties, except (i) the provisions set forth in the last
sentence of Section 4.4, above, this Section 8.2, Section 8.3, below, and
Article 9, below, shall survive the termination of this Agreement
indefinitely, (ii) the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements shall
survive the termination of this Agreement (subject to the time period set
forth therein), and (iii) nothing herein, including Section 8.3(c), shall
relieve any party from liability for any intentional or willful breach of this
Agreement.

 

8.3

 

 _Fees and Expenses_. 

 

(a)

 

Except as set forth in Section 8.2, above, and this Section 8.3, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees and
expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 

(b)

 

(i)

 

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 8.1(g) or 8.1(h), above,
the Company shall pay the Termination Fee to the Parent in immediately
available funds within one (1) Business Day after such termination.

 

(ii)

 

If (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or 8.1(f), above (and prior to such
termination the Company shall not have held the Shareholders Meeting pursuant
to Section 6.2, above), or Section 8.1(d), above, (or any other Section of
Section 8.1, when such Agreement was otherwise terminable under Section
8.1(d)), and (B) prior to such termination a Takeover Proposal (other than by
the Parent and the Merger Sub) shall have been received by the Company and
publicly announced and not withdrawn or abandoned, then the Company shall pay
or cause to be paid to the Parent in immediately available funds an amount
equal to the Reimbursable Expenses within one (1) Business Day after such
termination, and if, within twelve (12) months following the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to this clause 8.3(b)(ii), a Takeover Proposal is
consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for
such Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to the
Parent in immediately available funds an amount equal to the Termination Fee
within one (1) Business Day after the Company enters into such definitive
agreement or such

 


  

 

41

 



 

transaction is consummated, whichever is earlier; provided, however, that set-
off against the Termination Fee owed under this subsection (b)(ii) shall be
the amount of all Reimbursable Expenses paid by the Company. For purposes of
this subsection (b)(ii), each reference to "Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed
a reference to a "Takeover Proposal" as defined herein, provided that each
reference to twenty percent (20%) in the definition thereof shall be replaced
with fifty percent (50%).

 

(c)

 

Payment of the fees described in Section 8.3(b), above, and, as applicable,
payment of Reimbursable Expenses, shall be the exclusive monetary remedy of
the Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries for a termination of this Agreement
under which such Termination Fee and Reimbursable Expenses would be payable
pursuant to the terms of this Section 8.3 and shall be in lieu of damages
incurred in the event of any such termination of this Agreement other than any
damages related to a breach of Section 4.3 hereof.

 

(d)

 

Each of the Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements set forth
in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that without these agreements, the Parent and Merger Sub
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to
timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to
obtain the payment, the Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment
against the Company for the payment set forth in this Section 8.3, the Company
shall pay to the Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate of Citibank N.A.
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment.

 

8.4

 

 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies by the other parties hereto in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance by the other parties hereto with
any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure
to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent other failure.

 

ARTICLE 9- GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

9.1

 

 _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any agreement,

(for avoidance of doubt, excluding any representation or warranty provided by
a party) that by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.
