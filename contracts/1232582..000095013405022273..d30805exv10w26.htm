acknowledges that Seller is relying on Manager to provide such list
and copies of the Operating Agreements. Buyer acknowledges that Buyer is
assuming all Operating Agreements whether or not same are set forth on
Exhibit "G" or whether or not copies of which have been provided to Buyer,
and Buyer hereby waives any claims Buyer may have for any inaccuracy in
the list of Operating Agreements set forth on Exhibit "G" or the fact that a
particular Operating Agreement may not have been provided to Buyer for its
review.

In the absence of a protective order, such party and its Representatives may disclose only such Confidential Information as may in such partys reasonable opinion, be necessary to avoid any penalty, sanction, or other material adverse consequence, and such party will use commercially reasonable efforts to secure confidential treatment of any Confidential Information so disclosed. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any party hereto shall have the right to make a public announcement regarding the transaction described in this Agreement, provided, however, that, prior to and as a condition precedent to such public announcement, all other parties hereto shall approve the timing, form and substance of any such public announcement, except if a party hereto is required to make a public announcement under any securities law, the party making such public announcement may do so only after having provided the other party with a copy of such public announcement and only as long as such public announcement is made in strict accordance with the applicable law requiring such public announcement be made. 

  

 (c) Without limiting the generality of the provisions in subsection (a) above, Buyer shall not, through its officers, employees, managers, contractors, consultants, agents, representatives or any other person (including, without limitation, Buyers third party consultants), directly or indirectly, communicate with any governmental authority or any official, employee or representative thereof, involving any matter with respect to the Property without the Sellers prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless such communication is arranged by the Sellers.

applicable governmental authority in connection with the issuance of any
liquor licenses required for the sale of liquor at the Hotels (including,
without limitation, the filing of any applications or other documents), and
any and all other permits or licenses required to be transferred or applied
for in connection with the sale of the Hotels, all without the prior
consent of the Sellers; provided, however, that (i) Buyer shall provide
Sellers with regular updates regarding the progress of any and all such
communications; and (ii) no inspections of the Hotels by the applicable
governmental authorities shall occur unless a representative of the Sellers
is present during such inspections. 

  

 (d) _Communication with Employees_. Without limiting the generality of the provisions in subsection (a) above, Buyer shall not, through its officers, employees, managers, contractors, consultants, agents, representatives or any other person (including, without limitation, Buyers third party consultants), directly or indirectly, communicate with any Employees or any person representing any Employees involving any matter with respect to the Property, the Employees or this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Sellers and Managers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such communication is arranged by the Sellers and/or Managers. 

  

 _Section 14.12_ _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence of this Agreement and each term and provision hereof; provided, however (unless specifically provided to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement), when the date by which any action, event or condition is to occur or any notice or other communication is to be given falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the date by which such action, event or condition is to occur or such notice or other communication is to be given shall be automatically extended to the business day immediately succeeding such Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.
