ARTICLE III

 

 _CONVERSION OF SHARES_

 

Section 3.1 _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each common share of the Company, $0.01 par value
(a " _Company Common Share_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Company Common Shares to be cancelled pursuant
to Section 3.1(c)) shall be automatically converted into one Surviving
Corporation Share, and each of the resulting Surviving Corporation Shares
shall be automatically exchanged for (subject to _Section 3.3_) the right to
receive (i) 0.3521 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a duly authorized, validly
issued and fully paid ordinary share ( _gewoon aandeel_ ) of Parent, par
value EUR 0.20 per share (a "Parent Ordinary Share," and such Parent Ordinary
Share, the " _Parent Share Consideration_ "); and (ii) $6.25 in cash, without
interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ ", and together with the Parent Share
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 



18 (b) Each common share, $1.00 par value, of Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one (1) validly issued, fully paid common share of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) All Company Common Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury
shares immediately prior to the Effective Time and any Company Common Shares
owned by Parent, Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective
Time, be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, each Company Common Share converted into a
Surviving Corporation Share and the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and the holders of Book Entry Shares and the holders of certificates
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
outstanding Company Common Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive Surviving
Corporation Shares in accordance with Section 3.1(a) and, upon transfer of
such Surviving Corporation Shares in accordance with Section 3.2, the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, for each such Company Common
Share.

 

(e) If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
any change in the number of issued or outstanding Company Common Shares,
Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Preferred Shares shall occur as a result of a
reclassification, recapitalization, share split (including a reverse share
split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any share
dividend or share distribution (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Shares, Parent Ordinary Shares or
Parent Preferred Shares) with a record date during such period, the amount of
the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(a) shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change.

(f) No fraction of a Parent Ordinary Share will be issued by virtue of the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each Registered Shareholder that would otherwise
be entitled to a fraction of a Parent Ordinary Share (after aggregating all
fractional Parent Ordinary Shares that otherwise would be received by such
holder) shall, upon surrender of such holders Certificate(s) or Book Entry
Share(s) or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon
delivery of an affidavit in the manner provided in Section 3.2(g),
receive compensation in accordance with either option (i) or option (ii)
below, at the election of Parent.

(i) The compensation shall be an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole
cent), without interest, equal to the product of: (i) such fraction,
multiplied by (ii) the average of the per share closing prices of Parent
Ordinary Shares reported on Nasdaq during the five (5) consecutive trading
days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date, or

 



19 (ii) To facilitate payment of the compensation, Parent shall issue at
the Effective Time to the Exchange Agent a number of Parent Ordinary Shares
resulting from aggregating the fractional entitlements of all Registered
Shareholders (rounded downwards to the nearest whole Parent Ordinary Share)
(the " _Excess Shares_ "), which Excess Shares shall be issued and paid up in
accordance with Section 3.2 and shall be held by the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of the Registered Shareholders who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a Parent Ordinary Share. Following the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent, as agent for each such Registered Shareholder, shall sell the
Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on NASDAQ in accordance with the
remainder of this Section 3.1(f). The Exchange Agent shall use all reasonable
efforts to complete the sale of the Excess Shares as promptly following the
Effective Time as, in the Exchange Agents reasonable judgment, is practicable
consistent with obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of
prevailing market conditions, but in any case within five (5) trading days
after the Closing Date. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the
proceeds from such sale of Excess Shares to which each Registered Shareholder
that would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a Parent Ordinary Share
shall be entitled, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds from
the sale of all Excess Shares by a fraction the numerator of which is the
amount of the fractional share interest to which such Registered Shareholder
is entitled (after taking into account all Company Common Shares held
immediately prior to the Effective Time by such Registered Shareholder) and
the denominator of which is the number of Excess Shares.

Section 3.2 _Contribution in Kind to Parent and Issuance and Delivery of
Parent Ordinary Shares to Former Registered Shareholders_.

(a) Prior to the filing of the Registration Statement, Parent shall appoint a
United States bank or trust company or other independent financial
institution in the United States (or Affiliate thereof) (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") that is reasonably acceptable to the Company to act, among other
things, as exchange agent for the Merger and to deliver the Merger
Consideration to former Registered Shareholders. Parent and the Company shall
enter into an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent, which
agreement shall set forth the duties, responsibilities and obligations of
the Exchange Agent consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including
with regard to the contribution of Surviving Corporation Shares to Parent
pursuant to this Section 3.2(a). Immediately following the Effective Time, and
in accordance with the provisions of Section 2:94b of the Dutch Civil Code (
_Burgerlijk Wetboek_ ), the Exchange Agent, acting as exchange agent and
solely for the account and benefit of the former Registered Shareholders
(other than the holders of Company Common Shares to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 3.1(c)), shall contribute, for the account and benefit of the former
Registered Shareholders (other than the holders of Company Common Shares to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(c)), all of the issued and outstanding
Surviving Corporation Shares that were issued to the Exchange Agent solely for
the account and benefit of the former Registered Shareholders (other than the
holders of Company Common Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(c))
pursuant to Section 2.2 to Parent, as a contribution in kind ( _inbreng op
aandelen anders dan in geld_ ) and, in consideration of this contribution in
kind, Parent shall issue ( _uitgeven_ ) and deliver ( _leveren_ ) to the
Exchange Agent for the account and benefit of the former Registered
Shareholders (other than the holders of Company Common Shares to be cancelled
pursuant to Section 3.1(c)) (i) the aggregate number of Parent Ordinary
Shares to be issued pursuant to

 



20  Sections 3.1(a) and (ii) the aggregate Cash Consideration to be paid
pursuant to Sections 3.1(a) (such Parent Ordinary Shares and Cash
Consideration, the " _Consideration Fund_ "). In addition, Parent shall (if
it does not elect to compensate for fractional entitlements to Parent Ordinary
Shares in accordance with Section 3.1(f)(ii)) make available necessary cash in
an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 3.1(f)(i) and any dividends or distribution which holders of Company
Common Shares may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(h). In the event the
Consideration Fund shall be insufficient to pay the Cash Consideration
contemplated by Sections 3.1 (including with respect to Company Common Shares
held by Registered Shareholders who did not vote in favor of the Merger but
who did not exercise, or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, their
rights to appraisal of such Company Common Shares under the Companies Act) and
3.4(d), Parent shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, additional
funds to the Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency
required to make such payments.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each Registered Shareholder whose shares were converted into
Surviving Corporation Shares and the right to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 3.1: a letter of transmittal, in customary form, and
instructions for use, the form and substance of which letter of transmittal
and instructions shall be substantially as reasonably agreed to by the Company
and Parent and prepared prior to the Closing. Upon receipt of an "agents
message" by the Exchange Agent in connection with the transfer of a Book Entry
Share or surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, in
each case together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and with such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Book Entry Share or Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, the Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares and any
dividends or distributions payable with respect to any Parent Share
Consideration, if any, in each case pursuant to the provisions of this
Article III, and the Book Entry Share so transferred or Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid to holders
of Book Entry Shares or Certificates in connection with, or accrued on,
the Merger Consideration, any cash paid in lieu of the issuance of any
fractional shares or dividends or distributions payable with respect to Parent
Share Consideration. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than a Registered Shareholder in whose name the Book Entry Share
transferred or Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it
shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
Registered Shareholder owning the Book Entry Share transferred or Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(c) Any cash in the Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Exchange
Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such investments shall be in short-term obligations of
the United States with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or
guaranteed by the United States and backed by the full faith and credit of
the United States. Earnings on the Consideration Fund in excess of the amounts
payable to the Registered Shareholders shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Parent and the 

 



21  Surviving Corporation and shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as Parent directs. No investment of the Consideration Fund shall
relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent from promptly
making the payments required by this Article III, and following any losses
from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional cash funds
to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the former Registered Shareholders
(other than the holders of Company Common Shares to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 3.1(c)) in the amount of such losses, which additional funds will be
deemed to be part of the Consideration Fund.

 

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the share
transfer books of the Company of the Company Common Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III, except
as otherwise provided by Law.

(e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former Registered
Shareholders one (1) year after the Effective Time shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, be delivered to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation for no consideration. Any Registered Shareholder owning
Certificates or Book Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this
Article III with respect to such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger
Consideration (and any amounts owed pursuant to Sections 3.1(f) and 3.2(h)) in
respect thereof.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from
the Consideration Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or
Book Entry Share shall not have been surrendered or transferred, respectively,
prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect thereof would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity
pursuant to applicable Law, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and any
Registered Shareholder of such Certificate or Book Entry Share who has not
theretofore complied with this Article III with respect thereto
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger
Consideration (and any amounts owed pursuant to Sections 3.1(f) and 3.2(h)) in
respect thereof.

 

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact (which affidavit shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange Agent) by the Person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and if required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may so
require, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such Person is
entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this Article III.

 



22 (h) Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared or made after the
date hereof with respect to Parent Ordinary Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time, such declaration shall include a dividend or other
distribution in respect of all Parent Ordinary Shares issuable pursuant to
this Agreement as at that record date and not held by Parent pursuant to
Section 3.2(e) or Section 3.2(f) (for which unpaid distributions shall be paid
by Parent in cash without interest to the Registered Shareholder upon delivery
of those Parent Ordinary Shares). No dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Parent Ordinary Shares
with a record date after the Effective Time and no payment in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.1(f) will be paid to the
Registered Shareholder owning any unsurrendered Certificates or Book Entry
Shares with respect to Parent Ordinary Shares represented thereby until the
Registered Shareholders of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall
surrender such Certificates or Book Entry Shares. Subject to applicable Law,
following surrender of any such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver to the Registered Shareholders of such
Certificates or such Book Entry Shares, as applicable, without interest (i)
promptly after such surrender, such number of whole Parent Ordinary Shares
issued in exchange for the Surviving Corporation Shares into which the Company
Common Shares represented by such Certificates or Book Entry Shares
were converted pursuant to Section 3.1(a), the Cash Consideration payable in
exchange therefor, in each case pursuant to Section 3.1(a), along with payment
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.1(f) and the amount of any
such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time and theretofore paid with respect to such whole Parent Ordinary Shares
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole Parent
Ordinary Shares.

 

Section 3.3 _Shares of Dissenting Shareholders_. At the Effective Time, each
Dissenting Share shall be converted into one Surviving Corporation Share and,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law, such Surviving Corporation Share
shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration from the
Exchange Agent. Any Dissenting Shareholders shall receive payment of the
Merger Consideration only upon such final determination of the claim relating
to those Dissenting Shares, and, in the event that the fair value of a
Dissenting Share as appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda under Section
106(6) of the Companies Act (the " _Appraised Fair Value_ ") is greater than
the Merger Consideration, shall be entitled to receive, following the decision
of the court, a cash payment in an amount equal to the difference between the
Appraised Fair Value and the value of the Merger Consideration from the
Surviving Corporation by payment within thirty (30) days after the Appraised
Fair Value is finally determined pursuant to such appraisal procedure. The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of (A) any demands for appraisal
of Dissenting Shares or attempted withdrawal or withdrawals of such demands
received by the Company and any other instruments served under the Companies
Act and received by the Company relating to any Dissenting Shareholders
right to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shareholders Dissenting
Shares and (B) to the extent that the Company has Knowledge, any applications
to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the
Dissenting Shares and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
opportunity to participate with the Company in any and all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any written demands for appraisal under the
Companies Act. Neither the Company nor Parent shall, without the prior written
consent of the other party, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle, or offer to settle, any such demands or applications, or waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any
other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the Companies Act.

 



23 Section 3.4 _Treatment of Stock Options; Restricted Share Units; and Company
Performance Restricted Share Units_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option (whether
vested or unvested) shall, without any further action on the part of any
holder thereof, be assumed and converted into an option to purchase from
Parent, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company
Stock Option, that number of Parent Ordinary Shares (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) equal to the sum of (x) the product of (A) the number of
Company Common Shares subject to such Company Stock Option and (B) the
Exchange Ratio and (y) the product of (A) the number of Company Common Shares
subject to such Company Stock Option and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing
(i) the Cash Consideration by (ii) the Parent Measurement Price, at an
exercise price per Parent Ordinary Share (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the aggregate exercise
price for the Company Common Shares subject to such Company Stock Option by
(2) the aggregate number of Parent Ordinary Shares to be subject to
such Company Stock Option after giving effect to the adjustments in this
Section 3.4(a) (each, as so adjusted, a " _Converted Parent Option_ "). All
rounding described in this Section 3.4(a) shall be done on an aggregate
basis. 

(b) The Converted Parent Options shall have the same vesting schedule
(including any acceleration of vesting as provided in the Company Equity
Plans) as the Company Stock Options and otherwise shall have the same terms
and conditions as such Company Stock Options; _provided,_ that Parent shall
convert Company Stock Options into Converted Parent Options in a manner that
would not cause the Converted Parent Options to be treated as the grant of a
new stock right for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. After such
assumption and conversion, the Converted Parent Options shall be subject to
all of the terms and conditions of the plan and grant agreements under which
the Company Stock Options were originally issued (including any applicable
change in control or other accelerated vesting provisions, and this
transaction shall constitute a change in control for all relevant
provisions).

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the unvested Company
Restricted Share Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into that number of restricted share units of Parent
Ordinary Shares (" _Converted RSUs_ ") equal to the sum of (x) the product of
(A) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Restricted
Share Units and (B) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the product of (A) the number
of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Restricted Share Units and
(B) the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Cash Consideration by (ii) the
Parent Measurement Price. Any Converted RSUs issued pursuant to this Section
3.4(c) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Company Restricted Share Units (including any applicable change in
control or other accelerated vesting provisions, and this transaction shall
constitute a change in control for all relevant provisions).

 

(d) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the unvested Company
Performance Restricted Share Units outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective

 



24  Time shall be converted into that number of restricted share units of Parent
Ordinary Shares (" _Converted PRSUs_ ") equal to the sum of (x) the product of
(A) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Performance
Restricted Share Units (giving effect to the last sentence of this Section
3.4(d)) and (B) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the product of (A) the number of
the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Performance
Restricted Share Units (giving effect to the last sentence of this Section
3.4(d)) and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Cash Consideration
by (ii) the Parent Measurement Price. Any Converted PRSUs issued pursuant to
this Section 3.4(d) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Performance Restricted Share Units (after giving
effect to any applicable change in control or other accelerated vesting
provisions, for which purposes this transaction shall constitute a change in
control). Prior to the Effective Time, solely to the extent required as of the
date hereof under the terms of the applicable award agreement governing a
Company Performance Restricted Share Unit, the Company shall take all actions
(including causing its board of directors, the compensation committee of
Companys board of directors, or a committee overseeing the Company Equity
Plans to take all actions) to determine the level of performance achieved with
respect to each such outstanding Company Performance Restricted Share Unit.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to effectuate the provisions set forth in this Section 3.4; _provided_ , that
no action taken by the Company shall be required to be irrevocable until
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The parties shall, to the extent
necessary minimize the tax impact of the provisions set forth in this Section
3.4, cooperate in good faith prior to the Effective Time to develop a
mechanism with respect to Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Share
Units and Company Performance Restricted Share Units held by individuals
subject to Taxes imposed by the Laws of a country other than the United
States.

Section 3.5 _Parent Capital Increase_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall take or cause to be taken all such steps as may be required for Parent
to issue the Parent Ordinary Shares, the Converted Parent Options (and the
Parent Ordinary Shares underlying such options) the Converted PRSUs (and the
Parent Ordinary Shares underlying such units) and the Converted RSUs (and the
Parent Ordinary Shares underlying such units) in respect of the Merger (the "
_Parent Capital Increase_ "), including the due preparation of (i)
any required board and shareholders resolutions, (ii) the instruments of
issuance and (iii) the description of the contribution in kind and the receipt
of the accountants statement pursuant to Section 2.94b of the Dutch Civil
Code confirming the valuation of the in kind capital raise.

Section 3.6 _Withholding Rights_. The Exchange Agent, Parent, Sub and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any Merger
Consideration or other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as may be required under the Code or any other provision of applicable
federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law (and to perform any actions that may
be required in this context). To the extent that such amounts are so deducted
or withheld and are paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
or withholding was made. If Parent determines that any withholding described
in this Section 3.6 may be required by reason of the jurisdiction or Tax
Residence of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent shall notify the
Company of

 



25  any such requirement as soon as reasonably practical after such
determination is made by Parent and shall reasonably cooperate in good faith
with the Company to reduce or eliminate any such withholding.

respective dates.

 



30 (e) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)

communicated to the management of the Company as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the

under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. The Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this
Agreement, to its outside auditors and the audit committee of its board of

becoming due, or materially increase the amount of any compensation due, to
any current or former Service Provider, (ii) materially increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any U.S. Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan, (iii)

into, exchangeable for or representing the right to subscribe for, purchase
or otherwise receive any such equity security or obligating such

 



51  Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any such subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments, rights agreements or other similar agreements,
except, in each case, to or with Parent or any other Subsidiary of Parent.

to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of its share capital or other

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed or is obligated to,
directly or indirectly, make any future investment in or capital contribution
or advance to any Person (other than in any wholly-owned Subsidiaries of
Parent).

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity, on the other
hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a)
of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act)), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such commitment, joint venture, partnership,
Contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in the Parents or such
Subsidiarys financial statements.

Section 5.14 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete
and correct copies of an executed commitment letter, together with the related
fee letter (subject to redaction solely of fee amounts, original issue
discount amounts, pricing caps and other economic provisions that are
customarily redacted in connection with merger agreements of this type,
_provided_ , that such redactions do not relate to any terms that would
adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination
or aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing (other than through the
operation of original issue discount)), each in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (together, as they may be amended, modified, supplemented, replaced
or extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 6.13, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from the lenders
(including any lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities who become party thereto by joinder or otherwise, the "
_Lenders_ "), to provide debt financing in an aggregate amount set forth
therein and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein (being
collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ "). The Debt Commitment
Letter has not been amended or modified in any manner as of the date hereof.
The commitment contained in the Debt Commitment Letter has not been
terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and as of the
date hereof, to the Knowledge of Parent, no such termination, reduction,
withdrawal or rescission is contemplated. Parent has paid in full any and all
commitment fees or other fees and amounts in connection with the
Debt Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date of this
Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is (a)
in full force and effect and (b) the valid, binding and enforceable obligation
of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,

 



52  moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors rights and remedies
generally, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. There are
no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount (or any portion) of the Debt Financing, other than as expressly
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming the Debt Financing is funded
in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article IV to the extent necessary
to satisfy the condition in Section 7.2(a) and performance by the Company of
its obligations under this Agreement to the extent necessary to satisfy the
condition in Section 7.2(b), the net proceeds contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, together with cash on hand that will be available on the
Parent Balance Sheet as of the Closing Date, will, in the aggregate, be
sufficient for Parent and the Company to pay all of the cash amounts required
to be provided by Parent for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the amounts payable in connection with the
consummation of the Merger, all related fees and expenses required to be paid
as of the date of the consummation of the Merger and the funds to be provided
by (or on behalf of) Parent to the Company to enable the Company to fund the
repayment or refinancing of the Notes and the Company Credit Agreement and
all amounts payable pursuant to Sections 6.14(b), 6.14(c) and 6.14(d). As of
the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters, understandings or other
agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind relating to the
Debt Commitment Letter that could affect the availability of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this
Agreement, (i) no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of
time or both) would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
or failure to satisfy a condition precedent by Parent under the terms and
conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) assuming satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 and completion of the
Marketing Period, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied by Parent on a timely
basis on or prior to the Closing Date or that the Debt Financing will not be
available to Parent on the date of the Closing. In connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, no consents,
waivers or modifications to any indebtedness of Parent or its Subsidiaries is
necessary to incur the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter.

Section 5.15 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has, since December 31, 2014, incurred any liabilities or
obligations of any kind whether accrued, contingent, absolute, inchoate or
otherwise, that would be required to be reflected or reserved against in a
consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries
prepared in accordance with GAAP, as in effect on the date hereof, or the
notes thereto, except for (a) liabilities or obligations disclosed and
provided for in the consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries included in Parents Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2014 (" _Parent Balance Sheet_ ") or in the notes
thereto, (b) liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business since December 31, 2014, (c) liabilities and obligations incurred in
connection with the Merger or otherwise as contemplated or permitted by this
Agreement, (d) intercompany liabilities and obligations, (e) liabilities and
obligations that would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (f)
other liabilities and obligations that are otherwise the subject of any other
representation or warranty contained in this Article V.

 



53 Section 5.16 _Solvency_. Parent is not entering into this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Assuming (a) that the Company is Solvent
immediately prior to Closing (without giving effect to the Debt Financing or
the other transactions contemplated herein), (b) satisfaction of the
conditions to Parents and Subs obligations to consummate the Merger as set
forth herein, (c) the reasonableness of any estimates, projections or
forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries provided to Parent and that
such estimates, projections or forecasts have been prepared in good faith
based upon assumptions that were reasonable and (d) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article IV in all
material respects (but without giving effect to any materiality or Company
Material Adverse Effect qualifications contained therein) immediately
following the Closing after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Parent will be Solvent. As used herein, " _Solvent_ " means
with respect to any Person on a particular date, that on such date (a) the
fair value of the property of such Person is greater than the total amount
of liabilities, including, contingent liabilities, of such Person, (b) the
present fair salable value of the assets of such Person is not less than the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of such Person on
its debts as they become absolute and matured, (c) such Person has not
incurred, and does not intend to incur, debts or liabilities beyond such
Persons ability to pay such debts and liabilities as they mature and (d) such
Person is not engaged in business or a transaction, and is not about to
engage in business or a transaction, for which such Persons property would
constitute an unreasonably small capital.

 

Section 5.17 _Vote Required_. The Merger, the Parent Capital Increase, the
issuance of Converted Parent Options, and all other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement can be duly approved and resolved upon by Parents general
meeting of shareholders ( _algemene vergadering van aandeelhouders_ ) by a
simple majority of the votes validly cast by those shareholders of Parent
duly present or represented at such meeting (the " _Parent Shareholder
Approval_ "). The Parent Shareholder Approval is the only vote of the holders
of any class of shares in the share capital of Parent necessary to
approve and to resolve upon the Merger, the Parent Capital Increase, the
issuance of Converted Parent Options and all other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.18 _Board Recommendation_. Parents board of directors has (a)
determined that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and in the best
interests of Parent and its shareholders, (b) recommended approval of this
Agreement and the Bermuda Merger Agreement, including the Merger, the Parent
Capital Increase, the issuance of Converted Parent Options and all other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (c) subject to the other terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Bermuda Merger Agreement, resolved to
recommend that the shareholders of Parent approve and resolve upon, the
Merger, the Parent Capital Increase, the issuance of Converted Parent Options
and all other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, as of the date
of this Agreement, none of such actions by Parents board of directors has
been amended, rescinded, or modified.

in the DPA. Neither Parent nor Sub is controlled by a foreign person, as

60 Section 6.3 _Board Recommendation; Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries will not, and will use their reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective officers, directors, employees and
other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit, or
knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage, or participate or engage
in any negotiations, inquiries or discussions with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) in connection with any potential Acquisition Proposal, disclose

expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
the event that the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that has not been
solicited in violation of this Agreement, the Company and its board of
directors may participate in discussions or negotiations (including, as a part
thereof, making any counterproposal) with, or furnish any nonpublic
information to, any Person or Persons (but only after any such Person enters

Persons have submitted to the Company an Acquisition Proposal that is, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (ii)
the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that the failure to participate in such
discussions or negotiations or furnish such information, would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Companys
directors under applicable Law. In addition, nothing herein shall restrict the
Company from complying with its disclosure obligations with regard to any
Acquisition Proposal under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the foregoing
shall not permit the board of directors of the Company to make a Change of
Recommendation except as permitted by Section 6.3(e).

within two (2) days after receipt) notify Parent of the receipt by the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent, in
writing, of any decision of its board of directors as to whether to consider

under applicable Law, make a Change of Recommendation, including to approve
or recommend a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that:

advisors, (x) to cause the Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal, if applicable, or (y) if the proposed Change of

such action being referred to as a " _Change of Parent Recommendation_ ") or
(B) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or
allow Parent or Sub to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement,
or other similar agreement, arrangement, or understanding requiring it to
abandon, terminate, or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Parent Shareholder Meeting,
Parents board of directors may, if Parents board of directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the

Change of Parent Recommendation, including to approve a Parent Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , that: (i) Parent shall not take any such action until

information as is reasonably necessary to keep the Company informed in all
material respects of the status and material terms of any such Parent
Acquisition Proposal and of any material amendments thereto, (ii) keep the

Section 6.4 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For the benefit of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries employed
as of the Effective Time (the " _Employees_ "), for a period of at least
twelve (12) months following the Effective Time (or, if shorter, during an
Employees period of employment) and subject to the applicable Law of each
jurisdiction where Employees are located, Parent agrees to provide or cause
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to (i) provide each
Employee with base salary or wage rate and cash incentive compensation
opportunity that is no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate and
cash incentive compensation opportunity in effect for such Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide employee benefits
that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to Employees
by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (including equity or
equity-based compensation other than New-Hire/Promotion Awards); provided,
however, that any cash incentive compensation paid or equity or equity-based
compensation granted to an Employee by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in respect to the fiscal year that includes the Closing Date, shall
offset Parents obligations under this Section 6.4(a). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as conferring, or
intending to confer, on any Employee a right to continued employment with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates or continued receipt
of any specific employee benefit.

(b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall honor or cause to be honored, in
accordance with their terms, all U.S. Benefit Plans and Foreign Benefit
Plans.

(c) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) following the Effective Time and in which any of the Employees
participate (the " _Parent Plans_ "), and except to the extent necessary to
avoid duplication of benefits, for purposes of determining

 



64  eligibility to participate, vesting, accrual of and entitlement to benefits
(but not for accrual of or entitlement to pension benefits, post-employment
welfare benefits, special or early retirement programs, window separation
programs, or similar plans which may be in effect from time to time), service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent
the Company provides past service credit) shall be treated as service with
Parent and its Subsidiaries. Each applicable Parent Plan shall waive
eligibility waiting periods and pre-existing condition limitations to the
extent waived or not included under the corresponding U.S. Benefit Plan.
Parent Agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to give or cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to give the Employees
credit under the applicable Parent Plan for amounts paid prior to the
Effective Time during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs
under a corresponding U.S. Benefit Plan for purposes of applying deductibles,
co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent Plan.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will together develop
retention programs within the parameters set forth in Section 6.4(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule in connection with the Employees continuing
employment with the Surviving Corporation or Parent after the Effective Time,
which programs shall be acceptable in form and substance to each of Parent
and the Company.

(e) Unless Parent requests otherwise in writing, effective prior to the
Closing, the Company shall terminate the Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. 401(k)
Retirement Savings Plan (the " _Terminated Plan_ "). The Company shall provide
Parent with resolutions adopted by the Companys board of directors
terminating the Terminated Plan, the form and substance of which shall be
subject to the reasonable advance approval of Parent. As soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, with respect to the Terminated Plan, Parent
shall permit or cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation)
to permit the Employees to roll over their account balances and outstanding
loan balances, if any, thereunder into an "eligible retirement plan" within
the meaning of Section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Code maintained by Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation).

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this Section 6.4 with respect to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any other Person, including
employees, former employees, any participant or any beneficiary thereof in
any U.S. Benefit Plan, Foreign Benefit Plan or Parent Plans or (ii) to
continued employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 6.4 to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any U.S.
Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plans of
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or Parent or prohibits Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, from amending or
terminating any employee benefit plan.

 

Section 6.5 _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the
Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be acceptable
to Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the Company nor Parent (nor any
of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make
any other public announcement with respect to this

 



65  Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior review
and approval of the other party (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case the party
proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the
other party before making any such public announcements; _provided_ , that
neither Parent nor the Company will be required to obtain the prior approval
of or consult with the other party in connection with any such press release
or public announcement if (a) the Companys board of directors has effected a
Change of Recommendation pursuant to Section 6.3(e) or if Parents board of
directors has effected a Change of Parent Recommendation pursuant to Section
6.3(g), or (b) such press release or public announcement consists of
information previously disclosed in a previously distributed press release or
public announcement.

 

Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless
the individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time were directors or
officers of the Company or any of its present or former Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in
connection with actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the
fullest extent permitted by Law and by the bye-laws of the Company, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, promptly advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by

rights to exculpation or indemnification for acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time existing as of the Effective Time in favor of
directors and officers of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
predecessors in their capacity as officers or directors and the
heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries and administrators of such officer or
director (each, a " _D andO Indemnitee_"), as provided in the Companys or each
of its Subsidiaries respective memorandum of association and bye-laws (or
comparable organizational or governing documents) or in any agreement.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO
Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any
claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for
any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for
a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this

 



66  Agreement with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current DandO
Insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys
existing policies, or (ii) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the
Effective Time, the DandO Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys DandO
Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Companys current DandO Insurance
carrier, that is no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company or,
if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company for such insurance; and _provided_ _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) This Section 6.6 is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties and the
DandO Indemnitees, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent,
Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation. Parent hereby guarantees the
payment and performance by the Surviving Corporation of the indemnification
and other obligations pursuant to this Section 6.6 and bye-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns and
transferees of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective
successors or assigns, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.6.

 

Section 6.7 _Company Shareholder Meeting; Parent Shareholder Meeting; Proxy
Statement/Prospectus_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable Law, its organizational documents and NYSE Rules
or Nasdaq Rules, as applicable, to call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the " _Company Shareholder Meeting_ " in the case of the Company and
the " _Parent Shareholder Meeting_ " in the case of Parent), in each case, to
the extent practicable on the same day, as soon as practicable following the
date hereof (but in any event, no later than forty-five (45) days after
the declaration of effectiveness of the Registration Statement) for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in the case of the
Company Shareholder Meeting, and obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval, in
the case of the Parent Shareholder Meeting. Each of the Company and Parent
agrees that, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
Section 8.1, its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.7 will not be affected
by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or to Parent of any Parent

 



67  Acquisition Proposal, by the Companys board of directors effecting any
Change of Recommendation or by Parents board of directors effecting a Change
of Parent Recommendation.

 

(b) In connection with the Company Shareholder Meeting and the Parent
Shareholder Meeting, as soon as practicable after the date hereof (but, in
any event, no later than twenty five (25) Business Days following the date of
this Agreement) the Company and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a
Registration Statement on Form F-4 (or similar successor form) in connection
with the issuance of Parent Ordinary Shares in the Merger (including
amendments or supplements thereto) (the " _Registration Statement_ "), in
which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus relating to the Merger and this Agreement
shall be included (the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ") and furnish the
information required to be provided to the shareholders of (i) the Company
pursuant to the Companies Act and the Exchange Act and (ii) Parent pursuant to
the Laws of the Netherlands and the Exchange Act. Parent and the Company will
provide each other with any information which may be reasonably requested in

6.7. Each of Parent and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments from the SEC,

declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective
as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and the Company will notify the other
promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff in
connection with the filing of, or amendments or supplements to, the
Registration Statement and/or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Whenever any
event occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and/or the Registration Statement, Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of such
occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff, and/or mailing
to shareholders of the Company and Parent, respectively, such amendment or
supplement. Each party shall cooperate and provide the other (and its counsel)
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement/Prospectus prior
to filing such with the SEC, and will provide each other with a copy of all
such filings made with the SEC. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include
the recommendation of the Companys board of directors that the Companys
shareholders approve this Agreement (unless there has been a Change of
Recommendation pursuant to Section 6.3(e)) and the recommendation of Parents
board of directors that Parents shareholders approve the Merger and the
issuance of the Parent Ordinary Shares (the " _Parent Recommendation_ ")
(unless there has been a Change of Parent Recommendation pursuant to Section
6.3(g)).

(c) The Company agrees that none of the information supplied or to
be supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration
Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The
Company agrees that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by or

Proxy Statement/Prospectus, will, at the time the Proxy

 



68  Statement/Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto is first
mailed to the shareholders of the Company and Parent, respectively, and at the
time of the Company Shareholder Meeting and the Parent Shareholder Meeting,
respectively, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting
or the Parent Shareholder Meeting any fact or event relating to the Company or
any of its Affiliates which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus should be discovered by the Company or
should occur, the Company shall, promptly after becoming aware thereof, inform
Parent of such fact or event. Notwithstanding the forgoing, no
representation, warranty or covenant is made by the Company with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.
The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder.

be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration
Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to

light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Each of
Parent and Sub agrees that none of the information supplied or to be supplied

mailed to the shareholders of the Company and Parent, respectively, and at
the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting and the Parent Shareholder
Meeting, respectively, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit

Shareholder Meeting or the Parent Shareholder Meeting any fact or event
relating to Parent or Sub or any of their Affiliates which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus should
be discovered by Parent or should occur, Parent shall, promptly after becoming
aware thereof, inform the Company of such fact or event. Notwithstanding the
forgoing, no representation, warranty or covenant is made by Parent or Sub
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein. Parent agrees that the Registration Statement will comply
as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 

Section 6.8 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto agree to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act and to make all other filings contemplated by
applicable foreign Antitrust Laws set forth on Section 6.8(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (collectively, " _Foreign Antitrust Approvals_ ") with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and

 



69  in any event prior to the expiration of any applicable legal deadline
(provided that the submission or filing (i) of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act will be made within (60) calendar days of the date of
this Agreement and (ii) for applicable foreign Antitrust Laws shall be
submitted by the parties with the relevant notification forms, or a draft
thereof, for jurisdictions where submission of a draft prior to formal
notification is appropriate, within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case of this clause
(ii), if a party is not prepared to file any such submission or filing within
such period, its senior executives shall discuss the reasons for the failure
to meet such submission or filing deadlines with the senior executives from
the other party) and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable and
advisable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and any other filings required in connection
with the Foreign Antitrust Approvals or any other Antitrust Law. The parties
shall also consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith
the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties
in advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any such
Antitrust Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto agree to
(i) give each other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any
Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws, (ii) give each other an
opportunity to participate in each of such meetings, (iii) to the extent
practicable, give each other reasonable advance notice of all substantive
oral communications with any Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust

and proposals) with a Governmental Entity regarding any Antitrust Laws and
(vi) provide each other with copies of all written communications to or from
any Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws. Any such disclosures
or provision of copies by one party to the other may be made on an outside
counsel basis if appropriate.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent agrees, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries, to use its reasonable best efforts to take any and all
other actions necessary to obtain any consents, clearances or approvals
required under or in connection with the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended,
the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended,
and any other federal, state or foreign law, regulation or decree designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or the significant impediment of
effective competition (collectively " _Antitrust Laws_ "), and to enable all
waiting periods under applicable Antitrust Laws to expire, and to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under applicable Antitrust Laws asserted
by any Governmental Entity, in each case, to cause the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby to occur prior to the Termination Date,
including with respect to (but not limited to) (y) complying with or modifying
any requests for additional information (including any second request) by any
Governmental Entity as soon as reasonably practicable and advisable and (z)
contesting, defending and appealing any threatened or pending preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule,
regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the ability of any
party hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and taking any
and all other actions to prevent the entry, enactment or promulgation
thereof. Subject to the other

 



70  provisions of this Section 6.8, Parent shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to determine the nature and timing of any divestitures or other
remedial undertakings made for the purpose of securing any required approvals
under the Antitrust Laws.

(c) Parent agrees, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
to (i) enter into a definitive agreement with any Person or Persons (other

otherwise dispose of such RF Power Business of either Parent or the Company
and any other related assets to the extent necessary to make such RF Power
Business viable as owned by the purchaser thereof, including assets used by
such RF Power Business, employees dedicated to such RF Power Business, supply
arrangements as reasonably necessary to make such RF Power Business viable as
owned by the purchaser and can be supplied by Parent, the transfer of
Intellectual Property rights to the extent such Intellectual Property rights
are exclusively used for the purpose of such RF Power Business and a royalty-
free worldwide license on Intellectual Property rights which are not
exclusively used for the purpose of such RF Power Business, but excluding
assets and employees used in wafer manufacturing and wafer testing,
and excluding assets and employees used in packaging, assembly and final
product testing to the extent not primarily used for such RF Power Business;
(ii) take any such other actions and accept any other restrictions on the
activities of such RF Power Business being sold in the case of clauses (i)
and (ii) sufficient to obtain approval or clearance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by the relevant Governmental Entities (an " _RF
Sale_ "), as promptly as practicable following the date hereof (provided that
the closing of such RF Sale may be conditioned upon the Closing occurring
hereunder); and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to take any and all other
actions and accept any restrictions with respect to the business activities
of Parent or Company, including with respect to either Parents or Companys
RF Power Business that is not subject to the RF Sale, necessary to obtain
approval or clearance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
the relevant Government Entities, provided that nothing contained in this
clause (iii) shall require or obligate Parent to agree to or otherwise cause
to be taken any action if such action would reasonably be likely to have a
material adverse impact on any business line of Parent (disregarding, for
these purposes, any adverse impact resulting from an RF Sale). Parent shall
have the right to determine and select (in its sole discretion) the
assets, rights, products or businesses included within any RF Sale or other
action or restriction taken pursuant to clause (iii), above, and the Company
shall not without the prior written consent of Parent agree to or otherwise
cause to be taken any RF Sale or any other action pursuant to this Section
6.8(c).

(d) Subject to the terms hereof, and except with regard to the Antitrust Laws
which shall be governed by Section 6.8(a), Section 6.8(b) and Section 6.8(c),
the Company, Parent and Sub shall, and Parent and the Company shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, each use their reasonable best efforts to: 

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as reasonably practicable;

 

(ii) obtain from any Governmental Entity or any other third party any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders
and

 



71  send any notices, in each case, which are required to be obtained, made or
sent by the Company or Parent or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with
the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that in
connection therewith none of the Company or its Subsidiaries will be required
to (nor, without the prior written consent of Parent, will) make or agree to
make any payment or accept any material conditions or obligations, including
amendments to existing conditions and obligations;

 

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings and
notifications, and thereafter make any other required submissions and
applications with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under any
applicable statute, law, rule or regulation; and

 

(iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings, submissions, applications and requests. The
Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to furnish to
each other (on an outside counsel basis if appropriate) all information
required for any filing, submission, application or request to be made
pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable statute, law, rule or
regulation in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and the Company agree that
nothing contained in this Section 6.8(d) shall modify, limit or otherwise
affect their respective rights and responsibilities under Section 6.8(a),
Section 6.8(b) and Section 6.8(c).

 

Section 6.9 _CFIUS Approval_. If CFIUS requests or requires that Parent, Sub
or the Company (or their respective affiliates) file a joint voluntary notice
with respect to this Agreement or the Merger under 31 C.F.R. part 800.402(b)
or any other authority, provided that the representations and warranties of
Parent and Sub set forth in Section 5.19 remain true and accurate, each of
Parent, Sub and the Company will first seek informally to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of CFIUS that neither Parent nor Sub is a foreign entity under
the DPA and that neither Parent nor Sub is controlled by a foreign person as
defined under the DPA. If CFIUS continues to request or require a filing,
each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall (i) promptly file a joint voluntary
notice in accordance with the DPA and (ii) shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain CFIUS Approval. Such
reasonable best efforts shall include, without limitation, engaging in
prefiling discussions with CFIUS or its member agencies, promptly making any
draft and final filings required in connection with the CFIUS Approval in
accordance with the DPA, and providing any information requested by CFIUS or
any other agency or branch of the U.S. government in connection with the CFIUS
review or investigation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Such reasonable best efforts with respect to Parent and Sub shall include
agreeing to any action, restriction or condition required by CFIUS or any
other agency or branch of the U.S. government as a condition to obtaining the
CFIUS Approval.

 



72 Section 6.10 _ESPP_. The board of directors of the Company or appropriate
committee thereof shall take all necessary actions, including adopting any
necessary resolutions or amendments, to (a) cause the Offering Period (as
defined in the ESPP) (" _Offering Period_ ") that commences after the date of
this Agreement to be the final Offering Period under the ESPP, (b) to
prohibit participants in the ESPP from increasing their payroll deductions
from those in effect on the date of this Agreement and (c) to terminate the
ESPP prior to the Closing Date. If the Closing is expected to occur prior to
the scheduled end of the Offering Period, the Company shall take action to
provide for an earlier Exercise Date (as defined in the ESPP) (" _Exercise
Date_ ") in accordance with  _Section 4(g)_ of the ESPP. Such earlier
Exercise Date shall be no less than seven (7) business days prior to the
Closing Date, and the Company shall notify each participant in writing, at
least ten (10) days prior to the earlier Exercise Date, that the Exercise
Date for his or her option (including for purposes of determining the Option
Price (as defined in the ESPP) of such option) has been changed to the earlier
Exercise Date and that his or her option will be exercised automatically on
the earlier Exercise Date (with any participant payroll deductions not applied
to the purchase of shares returned to the participant), unless prior to such
date he or she has withdrawn from the Offering Period as provided in Section
6 of the ESPP.

Section 6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the board of
directors of the Company, or an appropriate committee of non-employee
directors, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance
of the SEC so that the disposition of Company Common Shares, Company Stock
Options, Company Performance Restricted Share Units and Company Restricted
Share Units pursuant to this Agreement by any officer or director of the
Company who is a covered person for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act.

Section 6.12 _Filing of Form S-8; Listing of Additional Shares_. Parent agrees
to file no later than the Closing Date a registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the Parent
Ordinary Shares issuable with respect to Converted PRSUs, Converted RSUs and
Converted Parent Options and shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as the Converted PRSUs, Converted RSUs and Converted
Parent Options assumed in accordance with this Agreement remain outstanding.
Parent shall at times ensure that there will remain a sufficient amount of
unissued Parent Ordinary Shares to meet its share issuance obligations
under Converted PSRUs, Converted RSUs and Converted Parent Options. Parent
shall also use its reasonable best efforts to take any action required to be
taken by it under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the
conversion of the Company Stock Options into Converted Parent Options, the
conversion of the Company Restricted Share Units into Converted RSUs and the
conversion of the Company Performance Restricted Share Units into Converted
PRSUs and under the Laws of the Netherlands and Parents articles of
association in order to duly authorize the grant of such rights to subscribe
for shares in its share capital free of preemptive rights at or prior to the
Effective Time, and the Company shall furnish to Parent any information
concerning the Company and holders of the Company Restricted Share Units, the
Company Performance Restricted Share Units and the Company Stock Options as
may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any such action.
Parent shall take all action necessary to cause the Parent Ordinary Shares to
be issuable upon the exercise of Company Stock Options and the vesting of the
Company Restricted Share Units and the Company Performance Restricted Share
Units, to be authorized for listing on Nasdaq upon official notice of
issuance at or prior to the Effective Time.

 



73 Section 6.13 _Financing_. Parent shall procure and have available, as of the
Closing, funds sufficient to pay all of the cash amounts required to be
provided by Parent for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the amounts payable in connection with the consummation of
the Merger, all related fees and expenses required to be paid as of the date
of the consummation of the Merger and the funds to be provided by (or on
behalf of) Parent to the Company to enable the Company to fund the repayment
or refinancing of the Notes and the Company Credit Agreement, in each case to
the extent required to be repaid or refinanced, and the amounts payable
pursuant to Sections 6.14(b) and 6.14(c). In furtherance and not in limitation
to the foregoing:

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including clauses
(I) and (II) of this Section 6.13(a)), Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, advisable or proper to arrange and obtain the
proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to the terms thereof on or prior to the
Closing Date. Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, (I) permit any amendment, supplement, replacement or modification to
be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Debt Commitment Letter,
if such amendment, supplement, replacement, modification or waiver (A) reduces
(or could reasonably be expected to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to
be paid or original issue discount), except (x) to the extent cash on hand is
available and will be available as of the Closing Date on the Parent Balance
Sheet in an aggregate amount at least equal to the amount of any such
reduction or (y) to the extent of the outstanding aggregate principal amount
of the Notes with respect to which the Consent Solicitations are successful
(but taking into account all amounts payable in connection with the Consent
Solicitations, including consent fees, solicitation agent fees and other
expenses payable in connection with the Consent Solicitations) or (B) imposes
new or additional conditions to the initial funding or otherwise expands,
amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the initial Debt
Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision of the
Debt Commitment Letter, in each case with respect to clause (B), in a manner
that would reasonably be expected (x) taking into account the expected timing
of the Marketing Period, to delay or prevent or make less likely the funding
in full of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt
Financing) on the Closing Date or (y) to adversely impact the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, in each case, as so
amended replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability
of the Parent to enforce its rights against such other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof or the definitive agreements
with respect thereto ( _provided_ , that Parent may amend the Debt Commitment
Letter to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities, so long as such action would not reasonably be
expected to materially delay or prevent the Closing or adversely impact
Parents ability to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter) or
(II) terminate the Debt Commitment Letter unless at the time of such
termination such Debt Commitment Letter is replaced with a new commitment
letter that, were it structured as an amendment to the Debt Commitment
Letter, would satisfy the requirements of the foregoing clause (I) (which
replacement commitment letter shall be

 



74  considered the Debt Commitment Letter hereunder). Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Company true, complete and correct copies of any such
amendment, modification or replacement.

 

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts (A) to maintain in effect the
Debt Commitment Letter (as, for the avoidance of doubt, may be amended,
modified or replaced pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement),
(B) to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Commitment Letter (the " _Debt Financing Agreements_ ") on the terms and
conditions consistent with the terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter or, if available, obtain alternative financing on other
terms that are acceptable to Parent, _provided_ , that (i) Parent
promptly provides notice to the Company of such alternative financing, and
(ii) the terms of such alternative financing are (x) in respect of certainty
of funding, equivalent in all material respects to (or more favorable to the
Company than) the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as in
effect on the date hereof and (y) not less beneficial in any material respect
to Parent in terms of its ability to enforce its rights in connection with
such alternative financing, relative to Parents ability to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on
the date hereof or the definitive agreements with respect thereto (any such
permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing to the Debt
Financing, including any potential issuance of cash convertible or other notes
by Parent or its Subsidiaries, collectively with the Debt Financing, the "
_Available Financing_ "), (C) to satisfy on a timely basis, taking into
account the expected timing of the Marketing Period, and in a manner that will
not impede the ability of the parties to consummate the Merger, all conditions
to receipt of the full amount of the Available Financing at the Closing set
forth therein that are within its control or subject to its influence and,
upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
(or, as applicable, the conditions in connection with other Available
Financing), to consummate the Available Financing at or prior to the Closing,
(D) to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter relating to the
Available Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to cause the
Persons committing to fund the Available Financing to fund on the Closing
Date the Available Financing required to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and (E) to comply with its obligations under the Debt
Commitment Letter relating to the Available Financing. Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide to the Company copies of
all substantially final drafts and executed definitive agreements for the
Available Financing, at each time promptly upon the Companys request.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company
promptly if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) the Debt Commitment
Letter is terminated for any reason, (ii) Parent becomes aware of any material
breach or default by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt
Financing Agreement, or (iii) a Lender indicates either in writing or orally
that it will not provide, or it refuses to provide, all or any portion of the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms set
forth therein. Without limiting Parents other obligations under this Section
6.13, if the commitments with respect to all or any portion of the Debt
Financing expires or is terminated or all or any portion of the Debt Financing
otherwise becomes unavailable or it becomes reasonably foreseeable that such
events will occur, then Parent shall (x) promptly notify the Company of such
event and the reasons therefor, (y) use reasonable best efforts to obtain
alternative financing 

 



75  from the same or alternative financing sources in an amount sufficient to
pay all cash amounts required to be paid in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, and (z) obtain, and when obtained, provide the

from terminating this Agreement by the first proviso in Section 8.1(b)(i))
without a vote of the Companys shareholders being taken with respect to the
Merger, (2) Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i) (unless the Company

are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which shall be
capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date the notice of
termination is delivered) are those set forth in Sections 7.1(b) or Section

clearance from a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction under
Antitrust Laws or any action by any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction to prevent the Merger pursuant to Antitrust Laws;

 

(ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) if the action by

be reduced by any amounts required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
applicable Law in respect of Taxes.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as
expressly set forth in the next sentence, a partys right to receive payment
of a fee set forth in this Section 8.2 shall, in the circumstances in which
such fee is owed pursuant to this Section 8.2, constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of such party and its Affiliates (and any other
Person) against any other party hereto and their Affiliates and
Representatives, Debt Financing Sources (if applicable) and respective Related
Parties for any losses, damages or liabilities arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the Support Agreement (or any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation contained herein or therein and
regardless of whether such breach is intentional, unintentional, willful or
otherwise), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or the
abandonment thereof), the failure of the Closing to be consummated, the Debt
Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated therein, including the
Available Financing (or the abandonment thereof), or in respect of any
other agreement, document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
Solely with respect to the fee set forth in Section 8.2(c), if Parents
willful and intentional (with the intent of breaching this Agreement) breach
of its obligations under Sections 6.8(a) - (c) caused the events giving rise
to the Companys right to payment of the fee set forth in Section 8.2(c),
then Parent shall pay the Company an additional fee of $300,000,000 in cash at
the same time a fee is paid pursuant to Section 8.2(c); it being understood
that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the fee referred to in this
Section 8.2(h) on more than one occasion and in no event shall Parent be
required to pay more than one fee pursuant to this Section 8.2(h). Upon
payment of such fee and the fee set forth in Section 8.2(c), each of Parent
and Sub shall have no further liability to the Company with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(i) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the covenants and agreements
contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that without these covenants and
agreements, the other parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if (A) the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent commences
action in a court of competent jurisdiction which results in a judgment
against the Company for the payment set forth in this Section 8.2, the Company
shall pay Parent for its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
actually incurred (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in
connection with such action; or (B) Parent fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain the payment, the
Company

 



90  commences action in a court of competent jurisdiction which results in a
judgment against Parent for the payment set forth in this Section 8.2, Parent
shall pay the Company for its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
actually incurred (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in
connection with such action; in each case together with interest on any unpaid
fee, cost or expense at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date such payment was actually received.

States federal court

 



94  located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court in the event

as specified in or pursuant to Section 9.3. However, the foregoing shall not
limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by
any other legally available method.

Section 9.11 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party to
perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take
all actions as are necessary on its part to consummate the Merger will cause
irreparable injury to the non-breaching parties, for which damages, even if
available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party
hereby consents to the granting of injunctive relief by any court of
competent jurisdiction to prevent breaches of this Agreement, to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof and to compel performance of such
partys obligations (including the taking of such actions as are required of
such party to consummate the Merger), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which any party is entitled under this Agreement. The parties
further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with any such remedy, and that such remedy shall be in
addition to any other remedy to which a party is entitled at law or in equity.

 



95 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall only be entitled to
seek specific performance of Parents or Subs obligation to effect the
