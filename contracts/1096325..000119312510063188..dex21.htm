iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("Agreement") is made and entered into on
March 22, 2010, by and among: INTERSIL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"); NAVAJO MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser"); and TECHWELL, INC., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this
Agreement are defined in _EXHIBIT A_ and other capitalized terms used in this
Agreement are defined in the Sections of this Agreement where they first
appear.

BACKGROUND

A. The Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company have each
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders
for Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth.

B. In furtherance of such acquisition, it is proposed that Purchaser shall
make a cash tender offer to acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company ("Company
Common Stock") that are outstanding and the associated preferred stock
purchase rights (the "Company Rights") issued in connection with and subject
to the Rights Agreement, dated August 4, 2009, between the Company
and Computershare Trust Company, N.A.(the "Company Rights Agreement") (which
Company Rights, together with the shares of the Company Common Stock are
herein referred to as the "Shares"), for $18.50 per Share (such amount, or
any greater amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer, being the "Per Share
Amount"), net to the seller in cash (the "Offer"), upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement and the Offer.

C. Following consummation of the Offer, Purchaser shall merge with and into
the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and each share of Company Common Stock that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and shares
of Company Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Purchaser
or held by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, which will be
canceled with no consideration issued in exchange therefore and Dissenting
Shares) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the Per Share Amount, all upon the terms and conditions set
forth herein.

D. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has (a)
unanimously determined that the terms of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, (b) approved and declared this
Agreement advisable in accordance with the DGCL and (c) determined to
recommend that the Companys stockholders accept the Offer and tender their
shares of Company Common Stock to Purchaser pursuant thereto and, to the
extent applicable, to adopt this Agreement. E. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and
material inducement to Parents and Purchasers willingness to enter into
this Agreement, Parent, Purchaser, the Company, and certain directors and
principal stockholders of the Company listed in _EXHIBIT B_ have entered into
Tender and Voting Agreements (collectively, the "Tender Agreements") and

F. The board of directors of each of Parent and Purchaser have approved this
Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Purchaser, respectively, to
enter into this Agreement.

AGREEMENT

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

SECTION 1. THE OFFER.

1.1. _The Offer_.

1.1(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with Section 8 and that none of the events or conditions set forth
in clause (c), (d), (e)(ii) or (e)(iv) of Annex A hereto shall have occurred
and be continuing and shall not have been waived by Parent and Purchaser
shall not be in breach of its representations, warranties and covenants set
forth in Sections 1.2, 3.2, 3.22, 3.25 and 5.3, Purchaser shall commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the
"Exchange Act")) the Offer as promptly as practicable after March 28, 2010 but
not later than April 5, 2010. The obligation of Purchaser to accept for
payment Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and to pay the Per Share
Amount for each such tendered and not subsequently withdrawn Share shall be
subject only to the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto (the "Tender Offer
Conditions"). Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive any such Tender
Offer Condition, to increase the Per Share Amount payable in the Offer, and to
make any other changes to the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided,
however, that without the prior written consent of the Company:

(i) the Minimum Condition (as defined in Annex A) may not be waived;

(ii) the conditions set forth in clause (b) (to the extent any such matter
could result in a Restraint), clause (e)(i)(B), and clause (e)(ii) (insofar as
it relates to clause (e)(i)(B)) in Annex A may not be waived if any such
waiver would be reasonably likely to result in personal liability to any
director, officer, or employee of any party hereto; and

(iii) no change may be made that (A) changes the form of consideration to be
paid pursuant to the Offer, (B) decreases the Per Share Amount payable in the
Offer, (C) reduces the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer,
(D) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those 



 

2  set forth in Annex A hereto, (E) amends, modifies or supplements any of the
terms and conditions of the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of
Shares, or (F) except as provided in Section 1.1(c), extend or otherwise
change the expiration date of the Offer.

1.1(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Purchaser shall file with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the
"Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer that will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of all applicable Legal Requirements. The
Schedule TO shall contain or shall incorporate by reference an offer to
purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") and forms of the related letter of
transmittal and forms of notice of guaranteed delivery and any related summary
advertisement (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and such other
documents, together with all supplements and amendments thereto, being
referred to herein collectively as the "Offer Documents"). Each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company agrees to correct promptly any information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser
further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. The Company shall promptly
furnish to Parent and Purchaser all information concerning the Company that is
required or reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser in connection with
the obligations relating to the Offer Documents contained in this Section
1.1(b). Parent and Purchaser shall give the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to
such documents being filed with the SEC or disseminated to holders of Shares.
Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Purchaser shall
provide the Company (in writing, if written), and consult with the Company
regarding, any comments (written or oral) that Parent or Purchaser or their
counsel may receive from the SEC or the SEC Staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. The Company and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed
responses before they are filed with the SEC and to participate in the
response of Parent and Purchaser to such comments.

1.1(c) Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Offer shall
remain open until midnight, New York City time, at the end of the twentieth
(20th) business day after the date that the Offer is commenced (the
"Expiration Date"), unless Purchaser shall have extended the period of time
for which the Offer is open pursuant to, and in accordance with, this Section
1.1(c) or as may be required by applicable Legal Requirements, in which event
the term "Expiration Date" shall mean the latest time and date as the
Offer, as so extended, may expire. Unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time
if (i) any Tender Offer Condition is not satisfied (or, in accordance
with Section 1.1(a) above, waived by Parent or Purchaser) on or before the
Expiration Date; or (ii) if any applicable Legal Requirement, rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff of 



 

3  the SEC (the "SEC Staff") thereof applicable to the Offer requires such
extension. Purchaser shall extend the Offer pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence for consecutive periods of up to five (5) business days
each (or for such period as the parties hereto may agree or as may be required
by any applicable Legal Requirement, rule, regulation, interpretation or
position); provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be required to extend
the Offer beyond the Outside Date. If this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Acceptance Date, Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours) irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer (and
return, or cause to be returned, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof). The Offer may not be terminated prior to its Expiration Date (as
such Expiration Date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with
this Section 1.1(c)), unless this Agreement shall have been validly
terminated in accordance with its terms.

1.1(d) If all of the Tender Offer Conditions are satisfied, but the number of
Shares that have been validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer,
together with any Shares then owned by Parent and shares that may be purchased
by Parent through the exercise of the Top-Up Option, is not sufficient to
enable a Short-Form Merger to occur pursuant to Section 6.3(b), Purchaser may,
in its sole discretion, and subject to the first sentence of Section 1.1(e)
below, commence a subsequent offering period (as provided in Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act) for three (3) to twenty (20) business days to acquire
additional outstanding Shares.

1.1(e) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and to
the satisfaction or waiver of the Tender Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall,
and Parent shall cause it to, (i) as soon as practicable after the Expiration
Date, accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the date of acceptance for payment,
the "Acceptance Date"), which acceptance may be by oral notice to the Paying
Agent, (ii) on the Acceptance Date, deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share
Amount for all such accepted Shares, and (iii) as soon as practicable
following such deposit, cause the Paying Agent to pay for all Shares so
accepted for payment (with all such payments to be subject to any
applicable withholding in accordance with Section 2.7(d)). Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds
necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer. 

1.1(f) Promptly after the Acceptance Date, the Company shall take all action
requested by Parent necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled
company" as defined by The NASDAQ Stock Market and make any necessary filings
and disclosures associated with such status.

1.2. _Company Action_.

1.2(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and
represents and warrants that the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and
held prior to the date hereof, has, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, unanimously adopted resolutions (i) determining that
the terms of the Offer, the Merger 



 

4  and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to and in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declaring the
Agreement advisable; (ii) approving the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer, the Merger, and the Tender Agreements
(collectively, the "Contemplated Transactions"); (iii) recommending that the
stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Purchaser
pursuant to the Offer and, if applicable, adopt this Agreement (the actions in
clause (iii), the "Recommendation"); (iv) resolving to make the
Recommendation to the stockholders of the Company and directing, that, to the
extent required by the DGCL, this Agreement be submitted for adoption by the
stockholders of the Company at the Stockholders Meeting, and (v) electing
that the Offer and the Merger, to the extent of the Company Boards power and
authority and to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, not be
subject to any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business
combination," "fair price" or other form of anti-takeover laws (collectively,
"Anti-Takeover Laws") of any jurisdiction that may purport to be applicable to
this Agreement (such actions by the Board of Directors described in the
preceding clauses (i) through (v), collectively, the "Board Actions"). Subject
to Section 6.1, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the
Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

1.2(b) The Company shall file with the SEC, concurrently with the filing by
Parent and Purchaser of the Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, a Tender
Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that will comply
in all material respects with the provisions of all applicable Legal
Requirements. Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish to the Company all
information concerning Parent and Purchaser that is required or reasonably
requested by the Company in connection with the obligations relating to the
Schedule 14D-9 contained in this Section 1.2(b). The Company agrees to mail
such Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company along with the Offer
Documents promptly after the commencement of the Offer. The Schedule 14D-9
and the Offer Documents shall contain, subject to any Adverse Recommendation
Change in accordance with this Agreement, the Recommendation. The Company
agrees to promptly correct the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect (and each of
Parent and Purchaser, with respect to written information supplied by it,
shall promptly notify the Company of any required corrections of such
information and cooperate with the Company with respect to correcting such
information) and to supplement the information contained in the Schedule 14D-9
to include any information that shall become necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, and the Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected
or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and promptly disseminated to the
Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Legal Requirements. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to
such document being filed with the SEC or disseminated to holders of Shares.
The Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Parent and its counsel. The Company shall provide Parent and Purchaser
(in writing, if written), and consult with Parent and 



 

5  Purchaser regarding, any comments (written or oral) that the Company or its
counsel may receive from the SEC or the SEC Staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments. Parent and Purchaser and their
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
proposed responses before they are filed with the SEC and to participate in
the response of the Company to such comments. 

1.2(c) The Company shall promptly furnish Purchaser with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with
security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a
recent date, together with all other available listings and computer files
containing names, addresses and security position listings of record holders
and beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall furnish Parent and
Purchaser with such additional information, including up-to-date listings and
computer files of stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings,
and such other assistance in disseminating the Offer Documents to holders of
Shares as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably request. Subject to applicable
Legal Requirements, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate
the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer
or the Merger, Parent and Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information
contained in such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only
in connection with the Contemplated Transactions or as otherwise permitted
under the Confidentiality Agreement, and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated in accordance with Section 8, shall deliver to the Company all
copies of such information then in their possession. 

1.3. _Top Up Option_.

1.3(a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Purchaser an irrevocable option
(the "Top-Up Option") to purchase, in whole but not in part, up to that number
of newly issued Shares (the "Top-Up Option Shares") equal to the number of
Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and Purchaser
following consummation of the Offer (or, if applicable, any subsequent
offering period), shall constitute one Share more than 90% of the Shares then
outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares)
for consideration per Top-Up Option Share equal to the Per Share Amount.

1.3(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once and only after the
acceptance for payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer (or, if applicable,
any subsequent offering period) by Parent or Purchaser as a result of which
Parent and Purchaser own beneficially at least a majority of the outstanding
Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.3) and (ii) the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms; provided, however, that (A) the Top-Up
Option shall not be exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common
Stock in excess of the shares of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued
or held in the treasury of the Company at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option (giving effect to the shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant
to all then-outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards and any other
rights issued by the Company to acquire Company Common Stock as if such shares
were 



 

6  outstanding), (B) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares shall not require
approval of the Companys stockholders under applicable Law (including the
rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market) and (C) the exercise of the Top-Up Option
and the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares shall not be prohibited by
any applicable Legal Requirement or Restraint.

1.3(c) In the event that Parent or Purchaser wish to exercise the Top-Up
Option, Purchaser shall give the Company at least one days prior written
notice specifying the number of Shares that are or will be owned by Parent and
Purchaser immediately following consummation of the Offer (or, if applicable,
any subsequent offering period) and specifying a place and a time for the
closing of the purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following
receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Purchaser specifying, based
on the information provided by Purchaser in its notice, the number of Top-Up
Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an
amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares purchased pursuant to
the Top-Up Option, multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Amount, shall be paid to
the Company, at the election of Parent and Purchaser, in cash (by wire
transfer or cashiers check) or by delivery of a promissory note having full
recourse to Parent and such other terms reasonably satisfactory to the
Company.

1.3(d) In the event of any change in the number of shares of outstanding
Company Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split,
recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares, merger, consolidation,
reorganization or the like or any other change in the corporate or capital
structure of the Company that would have the effect of diluting Parents
and Purchasers rights under the Top-Up Option, the number of Top-Up Option
Shares and the Per Share Amount shall be adjusted appropriately so as to
restore to Parent and Purchaser their rights hereunder with respect to the
Top-Up Option; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 1.3(d) shall
be construed as permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any
transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

1.3(e) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares that Purchaser may acquire pursuant to the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and any Top-Up Option Shares will be
issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving
a public offering. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company
that Purchaser is, and will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Options Shares,
an "accredited investor _,_ " as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option
Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be
acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or
for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the
meaning of the Securities Act).

SECTION 2. THE MERGER.

2.1. _Merger of Purchaser into the Company_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in Section 7 of this Agreement and in accordance with the

the first business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be

however, that if, as of or immediately following the Acceptance Date, the
expiration of any "subsequent offering period" pursuant to Section 1.1(d) or
the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, a Short-Form Merger is available

Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, or (b) such later date and
time as may be specified in the Certificate of Merger, in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements, with the consent of Parent and the Company. The
date and time the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as

2.4. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers_. At the
Effective Time:

2.4(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended to
read in its entirety in the form attached as _EXHIBIT C_ and, as so amended,
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by applicable Legal Requirements and such
Certificate of Incorporation;



 

8 2.4(b) the Bylaws of the Company shall be amended to read in their entirety in
the form attached as _EXHIBIT D_ and, as so amended, shall be the By-laws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by applicable
Legal Requirements, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and such By-laws; and

2.4(c) the directors and officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving

respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be, and
each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to effect the
foregoing.

2.5. _Conversion of Shares_.

2.5(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:

(i) each Share then held by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor;

(ii) each Share then held by Parent, Purchaser or any other direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above, each Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting
Shares (as hereinafter defined)) shall be canceled and shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive an amount equal to the Per Share
Amount (the "Merger Consideration") payable, without interest, to the holder
of such Share, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.7, of the
Company Stock Certificate that formerly evidenced such Share; and

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Purchaser
then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

2.5(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.5(b) shall be construed as
permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any transaction
otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.



 

9 2.6. _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time: (a)
all holders of certificates representing Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares other than as provided herein (including the right to
receive the Merger Consideration provided in Section 2.5(a)(iii)) or by
applicable Legal Requirements; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed with respect to all Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such Shares shall be made on
such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, a valid certificate previously representing any Share (a "Company Stock
Certificate") is properly presented to the Paying Agent (as defined in
Section 2.7) or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock
Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section
2.7.

2.7. _Surrender of Shares_.

2.7(a) At least five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall
select a reputable bank or trust company to act as paying agent in the Merger
(the "Paying Agent") to facilitate the receipt by the Companys stockholders
of the Per Share Amount in connection with the Merger. Promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Merger Consideration to be delivered
(other than any portion thereof allocable to any Dissenting Shares, which
shall be withheld by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to satisfy related
appraisal or dissenters rights matters and the costs thereof) by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Paying Agent (the "Payment Account"). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be
paid pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(iii) out of the Payment Account. The Payment
Account shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided,
however, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed
by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank that are then publicly available).

2.7(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event no later than five (5) business days after the Effective Time), Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to the record holders of Company Stock
Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming
that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
such Company Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent), and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to
the Paying Agent, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and
such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent or
Parent (or, if such 



 

10  shares of Company Common Stock are held in book-entry or other
uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the
surrender of such shares on a book-entry account statement (it being
understood that any references herein to "Company Stock Certificates" shall be
deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock)),(A) the holder of such Company
Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Company Stock
Certificate, without interest, and (B) the Company Stock Certificate
so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.7(b) and except as set forth in Section 2.9, each Company Stock
Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
evidenced by such Company Stock Certificate as contemplated by this Section
2\. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares
represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct)
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock
Certificate.

2.7(c) Any portion of the Payment Account that remains undistributed
to holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Company
Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 2.7 shall thereafter look
only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the Merger Consideration
payable with respect to any Shares represented by such Company Stock
Certificate.

2.7(d) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to Sections 1.1,
2.7 and 2.8) to any holder or former holder of Shares or Company Options such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other
applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

2.7(e) If any payment, pursuant to the Offer or the Merger is to be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Company Stock
Certificate is registered or who is the holder of a Company Option as of the
Effective Time, it shall be a condition of payment that the Company Stock
Certificate or Company Option so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting
such payment shall have paid all transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the Company
Stock Certificate surrendered (or with respect to a Company Option, the holder
as of the Effective Time) or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.



 

11 2.7(f) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder or former holder of Shares or to any other Person with respect to any
Merger Consideration properly delivered to any public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.

2.8. _Treatment of Awards Under the Company Stock Plans_.

2.8(a) The Company shall take all actions necessary (including providing any
required notices and obtaining any required consents) such that, effective as
of the Effective Time, all outstanding stock options granted under the
Companys 1997 Stock Plan, the Companys 2001 Stock Plan, the Companys 2006
Stock Incentive Plan or other governing share-based plan document or
agreement, including plan documents or agreements governing options that have
previously been assumed by the Company as a result of corporate acquisitions
(collectively, the "Company Stock Plans", and such stock options, the
"Company Options") shall, to the extent vested and exercisable as of the
Effective Time (after application of any provisions (in effect as of the date
of this Agreement) that would, without any termination of employment
or further action by any Person, accelerate the vesting and exercisability of
such Company Option upon the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions),
be cancelled in exchange for a payment (less applicable federal, state, local,
foreign and other withholding taxes) equal to the product of (A) the
difference, if any, between the Merger Consideration and the per share
exercise price of such Company Option and (B) the number of Shares with
respect to which such Company Option is vested and exercisable as of the
Effective Time; provided, however, that any Company Option, to the extent
vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time (after application of any
provisions (in effect as of the date of this Agreement) that would, without
any termination of employment or further action by any Person, accelerate the
vesting and exercisability of such Company Option upon the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions), with a per share exercise price equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration will be cancelled with no consideration
due the holder of such Company Option.

2.8(b) The Company and Parent shall take all actions necessary (including
providing any required notices and obtaining any required consents) to ensure
that each Company Option outstanding as of the Effective Time, to the extent
not cancelled pursuant to Section 2.8(a) above, shall be converted into, or
replaced with (through the grant of a substitute option), at the Effective
Time, an option representing the right to acquire, on substantially the same
terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability) as were
applicable to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
number of shares of Parent common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Parent
Common Stock") (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by
multiplying the number of Shares subject to such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time (and after giving effect to any cancellations
pursuant to Section 2.8(a) above) by the Option Exchange Ratio, at an
exercise price per share of Parent Common 



 

12  Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the per share
exercise price of such Company Option divided by (B) the Option Exchange
Ratio. Within a reasonable period of time after the Effective Time (but no
later than ten (10) business days after the Effective Time), Parent shall
cause the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each stock
option issued in connection with this Section 2.8(b) to be registered on Form
S-8 under the Securities Act or, if not available, on another appropriate
form. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
conversion (or replacement) pursuant to this Section 2.8(b) shall occur (i)
in a manner that meets the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations thereunder and (ii) with respect to any Company Option that is
intended to be an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422
of the Code, in a manner that meets the requirements of Section 424 of the
Code and the regulations thereunder.

2.8(c) The Company and Parent shall take all action necessary (including
providing any required notices and obtaining any required consents) to ensure
that each restricted share issued under a restricted stock award granted
under the Company Stock Plans (each, an "RSA") (i) is not tendered pursuant to
the Offer and (ii) is exchanged at the Effective Time for a restricted stock
award representing the right to receive, on substantially the same terms and
conditions (including vesting) as were applicable to such RSA immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the
number of restricted shares subject to such RSA that are being converted
pursuant to this Section 2.8(c) by the Option Exchange Ratio. Within a
reasonable period of time after the Effective Time (but no later than
ten (10) business days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each restricted stock award issued by
Parent in connection with this Section 2.8(c) to be issued under a
registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act or, if not
available, on another appropriate form.

2.8(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall take all
actions required to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.8
(including providing any required notices or obtaining any required consents)
to ensure that, following the Effective Time, no Person other than Parent and
its Subsidiaries shall have any right to acquire, or shall have any ownership
interest in, equity securities of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof.

2.9. _Dissenting Shares_.

2.9(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor
consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who comply in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall
not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration. Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions
of such Section 262 (and at the Effective Time such Dissenting Shares 



 

13  shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have any right with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with Section 262), except that Dissenting Shares held by
stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Shares under such Section
262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 2.7, of the Company Stock Certificate or Company Stock
Certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares.

2.9(b) The Company shall give Parent and Purchaser (i) prompt notice of any
demand for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

2.10. _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser
and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of the
Company and otherwise) to take such action.

SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY.

Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents
and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows:

 

3.1. _Organization and Good Standing_.

3.1(a) The Acquired Corporations are corporations or other Entities duly
organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of their
respective jurisdictions of incorporation, formation, or organization, with
full corporate power or other entity authority to conduct their respective
businesses as now being conducted, to own or use the respective properties and
assets that they purport to own or use, and to perform all their respective
obligations under Acquired Corporation Contracts. Each of the Acquired
Corporations is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or
other entity and is in good standing under the laws of each state or other
jurisdiction in which either the ownership or use of the properties owned or
used by it, or the nature of the activities conducted by it, requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations.



 

14 3.1(b) Part 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Acquired
Corporations and indicates as to each the type of entity, its jurisdiction of
organization and, except in the case of the Company, its stockholders or other
equity holders. Part 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists, and the
Company has made available to Parent copies of, the certificate or articles
of incorporation, by-laws and other organizational documents (collectively,
"Organizational Documents") of each of the Acquired Corporations, as currently
in effect. 

3.1(c) Part 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists, and the Company
has made available to Parent copies of, the charters of each committee of the
Company Board and any code of conduct or similar policy adopted by the
Company.

3.2.  _Authority; No Conflict_.

3.2(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Tender Agreements by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the Contemplated Transactions have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Contemplated Transactions (other than, with
respect to the Merger, the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a
majority of the then-outstanding Shares, if and to the extent required by
applicable Legal Requirements, and the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger and other documents as required by the DGCL). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and
(assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Purchaser) constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to the effect of (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to
rights of creditors generally and (ii) rules of law and equity governing
specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

3.2(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations set forth in Section 4.5,
the Company has taken all appropriate actions so that the restrictions on
business combinations contained in any Anti-Takeover Law will not apply with
respect to or as a result of this Agreement, the Tender Agreements and the
Contemplated Transactions, without any further action on the part of the
stockholders of the Company or the Company Board. No Anti-Takeover Law is
applicable to, or purports to be applicable to, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.2(c) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held and at which all
directors were present, has unanimously adopted the Board Actions.



 

15 3.2(d) The Company Board has duly and validly approved and taken all corporate
action required to be taken by the Company Board to grant the Top-Up Option
and to issue the Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise thereof. The Top-Up
Option Shares, if and when issued in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and any applicable Legal Requirements unrelated to corporate action
of the Company Board, and paid for by Parent or Purchaser in accordance with
this Agreement, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable.

3.2(e) The affirmative vote (in person or represented by proxy) at the
Stockholders Meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, of a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of outstanding Shares
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, is (unless the Merger is
consummated as a Short-Form Merger in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL
as contemplated by Section 6.3(b)) the only vote or approval of the holders of
any class or series of capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary
necessary to adopt this Agreement.

3.2(f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Tender
Agreements nor the consummation of any of the Contemplated Transactions do or
will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both), (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation of (A) any
provision of the Organizational Documents of any of the Acquired Corporations
so as to adversely affect the Company in a material manner, or (B) any
resolution adopted by the board of directors or the stockholders of any of the
Acquired Corporations so as to adversely affect the Company in a material
manner; (ii) contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation of any order
to which any of the Acquired Corporations, or any of the assets owned by any
of the Acquired Corporations, is or may be subject; (iii) violate any of the
terms or requirements of, or give any Governmental Body the right to revoke,
withdraw, suspend, cancel, terminate, or modify, any Governmental
Authorization that is held by any of the Acquired Corporations, or that
otherwise is applicable to the assets owned by, any of the Acquired
Corporations; (iv) contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation or
breach of any provision of, or give any Person the right to declare a default
or exercise any remedy under, or to accelerate the maturity or performance
of, or to cancel, terminate, or modify, any Material Contract; or (v) result
in the imposition or creation of any Encumbrance upon or with respect to any
of the assets owned or used by any of the Acquired Corporations, except,
in the case of clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that would not reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Acquired Corporations.

3.2(g) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Tender Agreements
by the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions by the Company will not, require
any Consent of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Body or
any other Person, except (i) for (A) applicable requirements, if any, of the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act and state securities or "blue sky" laws
("Blue Sky Laws") and The NASDAQ Stock Market, (B) actions required by the HSR
Act, (C) the filing of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL, and
(D) applicable requirements of applicable non-United States competition,
antitrust and investment laws, and (ii) where failure to obtain such Consents,
or to make such filings or notifications, would not reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Acquired Corporations.

to materially affect, the Acquired Corporations internal control over
financial reporting; (b) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses

respects the financial position and the results of operations, changes in
stockholders equity and cash flow of the Acquired Corporations as at the
respective dates of and for the periods referred to in such financial

omission of notes to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X (that, in the case
of interim financial statements included in the Company SEC Reports filed

materially from the notes to the financial statements included in such Annual
Report) (the consolidated balance sheet included in such Annual Report, the
"Balance Sheet"), and (ii) normal year-end adjustments (the effect of which
will not, individually or in the aggregate, be materially adverse to the
Acquired Corporations). The financial statements referred to in this Section
3.5 reflect the consistent application of such accounting principles
throughout the periods involved, except as disclosed in the notes to such
financial statements. No financial statements of any Person other than the
Subsidiaries of the Company are, or, since July 1, 2006 have been, required by

securing payments not yet due and (2) such imperfections or irregularities of

in possession of the properties purported to be leased thereunder, and each
such lease is valid and in full force and effect without default thereunder by
the lessee or, to the Companys Knowledge, the lessor, other than defaults

3.20. _Related Party Transactions_. Since the date of the Companys proxy

required to be reported under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the

39 3.21. _Encryption and Other Restricted Technology_. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired
Corporations, the Acquired Corporations business as currently conducted does
not involve the use or development of, or engagement in, encryption

export is restricted under Legal Requirements, including the U.S. Department
of States International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR") and the U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Securitys Export

3.22. _Rights Plan_. The entering into of this Agreement and the Tender
Agreements, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, do not and will not, (i) result in any Person being deemed to have
become an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement), (ii) result
in the ability of any Person to exercise any Company Rights under the Rights
Agreement, (iii) enable or require the Company Rights to separate from the
shares of Company Common Stock to which they are attached or to be triggered
or become exercisable or (iv) enable the Company to exchange any Company
Rights for shares of the Companys capital stock, pursuant to the Rights
Agreement. No "Distribution Date," "Stock Acquisition Date," or
"Trigger Event" (each as defined in the Rights Agreement) or similar event
has occurred or will occur by reason of (1) the adoption, approval, execution
or delivery of this Agreement and the Tender Agreements or the commencement of
the Offer, (2) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Tender Agreements or (3) the public announcement of any of
the foregoing. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of
the date hereof, the Company has not amended the Rights Agreement, redeemed
the Company Rights thereunder or taken any other action to make the Rights
Agreement or the Company Rights thereunder inapplicable, in each case, with
respect to (a) any Person or entity or (b) any Acquisition Proposal.

date of such opinion, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and
limitations set forth therein, $18.50 per Share in cash is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock.

3.24. _Brokers_. Other than Deutsche Bank, no broker, finder, investment
banker or other Person is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or
commission in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the Contemplated
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of any Acquired
Corporation. The Company previously has provided or made available to Parent
a copy of the Deutsche Bank engagement letter and fees set forth therein are

or supplements thereto are filed with the SEC or are first published, sent or
given to stockholders of the Company, as the case may be, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to
any information supplied by Parent, Purchaser or any of Parents or
Purchasers representatives for inclusion in the foregoing documents. The
Schedule 14D-9, at the time filed with the SEC, shall comply in all material
respects as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act.

of, or give any Person the right to declare a default or exercise any remedy
under, or to accelerate the maturity or performance of, or to cancel,
terminate or modify, any contract to which Parent is a party and was filed by
Parent with its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2009 pursuant to Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K; except, in the
case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), for any such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults or other occurrences that would not prohibit, prevent or
delay consummation of the Contemplated Transactions in any material respect,
or otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser from performing their respective
obligations under this Agreement in any material respect.

4.2(c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser
do not, and the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions by Parent and Purchaser will not, require any

other Person, except (i) for (A) applicable requirements, if any, of the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act and Blue Sky Laws and The NASDAQ Stock
Market, (B) actions required by the HSR Act, (C) filing of appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL and (D) requirements of applicable non-
United States competition, antitrust and investment laws and (ii) where

would not prevent or delay consummation of the Transactions in any material
respect, or otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser from performing their
respective obligations under this Agreement in any material respect. 

4.3. _Financing_. Parent has, and at the Acceptance Date shall have,
sufficient funds on hand to permit Parent and Purchaser to perform all of
their obligations under this Agreement and to consummate all the Contemplated

information supplied by Parent or Purchaser for inclusion in Schedule 14D-9
shall, at the time the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or any amendments
or supplements thereto are filed with the SEC or are first published, sent or
given to stockholders of the Company, as the case may be, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser make no representation or
warranty with respect to any information supplied by the Company or any of its
representatives for inclusion in any of the foregoing documents. The
Offer Documents, at the time filed with the SEC, shall comply in all material
respects as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act.

the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL, and neither Parent nor
Purchaser "owns" any shares of capital stock of the Company as defined in
Section 203 of the DGCL.

4.6. _Operations of Purchaser_. Purchaser has been formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the Transactions contemplated hereby, has not engaged
in any business activities and will have no assets, liabilities or
obligations other than as contemplated by this Agreement.

4.7. _Litigation_. There are no actions, suits, claims, investigations,
arbitrations or proceedings pending or, to Parents knowledge, threatened
against Parent or Purchaser before or by any court, arbitrator or Governmental
Body that, either individually or in the aggregate, would materially
and adversely affect Parents or Purchasers ability to consummate the Offer,
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

defined in the Rights Agreement) of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
"Common Shares" without causing a "Distribution Date," a "Stock Acquisition
Date" or a "Triggering Event" (as each such term is defined in the Rights
Agreement) to occur. The Company Board shall not make a determination that
Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or associates,
directors, officers or employees is an "Acquiring Person" for purposes of the
Rights Agreement. The Company and the Company Board shall take all action
necessary to render the Company Rights inapplicable to this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 6. ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS.

6.1. _No Solicitation_.

6.1(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Each of the Acquired Corporations
shall, and shall cause its respective directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or
representatives (such directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, other advisors and representatives, collectively,
"Representatives") to (i) immediately cease any discussions or negotiations
with any parties that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
and (ii) not modify, waive, amend or release (A) any standstill,
confidentiality or similar agreements entered into prior to the date
hereof, except an Acquired Corporation may waive any prohibition contained in
any such standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement that prohibits a
party from proposing or disclosing to the Company Board an intent to propose
any Acquisition Proposal to the extent failure to make such waiver would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable
Legal Requirements, as determined in good faith by the Company Board after
consultation with outside counsel, or (B) any standstill, confidentiality or
similar agreements entered into by an Acquired Corporation between the date
hereof and the Effective Time. From the date of this Agreement to the
Acceptance Date, except as set forth in this Section 6.1, none of the
Acquired Corporations shall, nor shall any of them authorize or permit any of
its Representatives to, directly or indirectly:

(i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly or intentionally encourage or facilitate,
any inquiries, offers or proposals that constitute, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, including, except as permitted
by Section 6.1(c), amending or granting any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any Company Common Stock; or



 

47 (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, furnish to any Person any non-public information with
respect to, assist or participate in any effort or attempt by any Person with
respect to, or otherwise knowingly or intentionally cooperate in any way with,
any Acquisition Proposal (provided, however, that providing notice of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.1 to a third party in response to any
such inquiry, request or Acquisition Proposal shall not, in and of itself,
be deemed a breach of this Section).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company may,
to the extent the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Legal Requirements, as
determined in good faith by the Company Board after consultation with outside
counsel, in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal made or received after the date of this Agreement that the Company
Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor, if any, is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal and that did not result from a breach by the Company of, or actions
by its Representatives inconsistent with, this Section, and subject to
compliance with Section 6.1(c), (x) furnish non-public information with
respect to the Acquired Corporations to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal and its Representatives and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such
Acquisition Proposal, if, in the case of either clause (x) or (y), prior to
taking such action the Company enters into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement.

Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall instruct
its Representatives as to the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.1(a)
and direct them to comply with its provisions and shall thereafter use
commercially reasonable efforts to assure that the Company Representatives
comply with such instructions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is agreed
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.1(a) by
any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.1(a) by the Company.

6.1(b) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.
Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

(i) fail to include the Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or, except as
set forth in this Section 6.1, withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly
announce its intention to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or the Purchaser, the approval, Recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board or any such committee of the Company Board
of the adoption of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions
contemplated hereby (an "Adverse Recommendation Change");



 

48 (ii) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly announce its intention to
adopt, approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or

(iii) authorize, cause or permit any of the Acquired Corporations to enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement (an
"Alternative Acquisition Agreement") constituting or relating to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 6.1(a) entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section
6.1(a)).

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 6.1, at any time prior to
the Acceptance Date and subject to compliance with Section 6.1(c), the
Company Board may in response to an Acquisition Proposal that the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel
and financial advisor, if any) constitutes a Superior Proposal and that was
made after the date hereof and that was unsolicited after the date hereof and
that did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.1, make an
Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board has concluded in
good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of
such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Company Board to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Legal Requirements; provided, however, that the Company Board
shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this sentence, unless the Company has: (A) complied in all
material respects with this Section 6.1, (B) provided to Parent two (2)
business days (unless the Superior Proposal arises fewer than two (2) business
days prior to the Acceptance Date) prior written notice (such notice, a
"Notice of Superior Proposal," which notice shall not be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change) advising Parent that the Company Board intends
to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the
material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of
the proposed action by the Company Board and the identity of the Person making
the proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any material amendment to any other material term of any
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a
new two (2) business day period (unless the amendment to the Superior Proposal
arises fewer than two (2) business days prior to the Acceptance Date)), (C)
during such two (2) business day period, if requested by Parent, engaged in
good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner
that any Acquisition Proposal that was determined to constitute a Superior
Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal and (D) at the end of such two (2)
business day period or shorter period, if applicable, such Acquisition
Proposal has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute, as determined in
good faith by the Company Board (after consultation with its outside counsel
and its financial advisors, if any), a Superior Proposal (taking into account
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent
following a Notice of Superior Proposal), as a result of the negotiations
required by clause (C) or otherwise.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 6.1, if at any time prior
to the Acceptance Date, the Company Board concludes in good faith that, in
light of a Material Subsequent Change (as defined below), after consultation
with its outside counsel, that 



 

49 the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Legal Requirements, it may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change; provided, however, that the Company Board shall
not be entitled to exercise its right to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this sentence, unless the Company has: (A) provided to Parent two
(2) business days (unless the Material Subsequent Change arises fewer than two
(2) business days prior to the Acceptance Date) prior written notice, which
notice shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change, advising
Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefor in reasonable detail, (B) during such two (2) business day
period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with
Parent regarding whether the Adverse Recommendation Change arising from the
Material Subsequent Change can be avoided by an amendment to this Agreement or
otherwise and (C) at the end of such two (2) business day period or shorter
period, if applicable, such Material Subsequent Change continues to
constitute, as determined in good faith by the Company Board (after
consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors, if any), a
Material Subsequent Change (taking into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent following such notice of Material
Subsequent Change), as a result of the discussions required by clause (B) or
otherwise. "Material Subsequent Change" shall mean, with respect to the
Acquired Corporations, a material event or development that was not known to
the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, which event or development
becomes known to the Company Board prior to the Acceptance Date; provided,
however, that in no event shall (i) the receipt, existence or terms of an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or any event arising
therefrom, relating thereto or any consequence thereof, constitute a Material
Subsequent Change , or (ii) any action taken by an Acquired Corporation after
the date of this Agreement (whether in breach of this Agreement or otherwise)
with the intention of causing a Material Subsequent Change to occur, or any
event arising therefrom, relating thereto or any consequence thereof,
constitute an Material Subsequent Change.

6.1(c) _Notices to Parent; Additional Negotiations_. The Company, upon gaining
Knowledge of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information
in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or of any inquiry with respect
to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal,
shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) advise Parent of such
Acquisition Proposal, request, or inquiry, the material terms and conditions
of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the Person
making any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed in all material respects of the status of any
such Acquisition Proposal and shall (i) promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) notify Parent if it has begun to furnish information to, or to
participate in discussions or negotiations with, a Person making any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and shall promptly (and in any event within
24 hours) advise Parent of any material change in the terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable
after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence, documents,
agreements and other written material (including any amendments, supplements
or modifications thereto) sent or provided to the Company from any third party
in connection with any Acquisition Proposal (provided that the Company may
redact any



 

50 information in such written material containing solely confidential and non-
public information of such third party) and (iii) if Parent shall make a
written counterproposal (including following delivery of a written Notice of
Superior Proposal to Parent pursuant to Section 6.1(b)), consider and cause
its financial and legal advisors to consider in good faith the terms of such
written counterproposal. Contemporaneously with providing any written
materials about the Company to a third party in connection with any such
Superior Proposal or inquiry, the Company shall furnish a copy of such
materials to Parent (to the extent not already previously provided). None of
the Acquired Corporations shall enter into any confidentiality agreement with
any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from
providing such information to Parent.

6.2. _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in Section 6.1 or in
Section 6.3 or otherwise contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required disclosure to
the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would
be required under applicable Legal Requirements.

6.3. _Stockholders and Stockholders  Meeting_.

6.3(a) After the Acceptance Date and if required by applicable Legal
Requirements in order to consummate the Merger, the Company, acting through
the Company Board, shall take all actions in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements, the Organizational Documents and the rules of The NASDAQ Stock
Market to promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of considering and voting upon the
Voting Proposal (as defined below); provided, that the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to vote at any such Stockholders Meeting
shall be after the Acceptance Date (or, if applicable, after the expiration
of any "subsequent offering period" pursuant to Section 1.1(c)), and, if the
Top-Up Option is exercised by Parent, after the date on which the closing of
the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares occurs pursuant to Section 1.3.
Subject to Section 6.1(b), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, (i) the Company Board shall recommend that the stockholders of
the Company vote to adopt this Agreement (the "Voting Proposal") and include
the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and (ii) neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose or resolve
to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Recommendation. The
Company shall take all action that is both reasonable and lawful to solicit
from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Voting Proposal and shall take
all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the
stockholders of the Company required by the rules of The NASDAQ Global Market
or the DGCL to obtain such approvals.

6.3(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject
to Section 7, if, as of immediately following the Acceptance Date, the
expiration



 

51 of any "subsequent offering period" pursuant to Section 1.1(c), the purchase,
if applicable, of the Top-Up Option Shares, and, if necessary, the expiration
of the period for guaranteed delivery of Shares in the Offer, Parent or any
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, taken together, shall own at least
90% of the total outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, the parties
hereto shall, subject to Section 7, take all necessary and appropriate action
to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the
satisfaction of such threshold, without a meeting of the stockholders of the
Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL (such Merger, a "Short-
Form Merger").

6.3(c) Parent and Purchaser agree to vote, or cause to be voted, all Shares
owned by them (or any Subsidiary) in favor of the Voting Proposal, unless the
Merger is consummated as a Short-Form Merger pursuant to Section 253 of the
DGCL.

6.4. _Proxy Statement_.

6.4(a) If approval of the Companys stockholders is required by applicable
Legal Requirements to consummate the Merger, promptly following consummation
of the Offer (or, if applicable, after the expiration of any "subsequent
offering period" pursuant to Section 1.1(c)), the Company shall (i) prepare
and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC under the Exchange Act, (ii) mail
to the holders of Shares a Proxy Statement within a sufficient time prior to
the Stockholders Meeting and (iii) otherwise comply in all material respects
with all Legal Requirements applicable to the Stockholders Meeting, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared
by the SEC promptly. Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate with
each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall
notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect
to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or
supplement thereto or for additional information and shall provide as soon
as reasonably practicable to Parent copies of all correspondence between the
Company or any representative of the Company and the SEC with respect thereto.
The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to such documents being filed
with the SEC or disseminated to holders of Shares and shall give Parent and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all responses to
requests for additional information and replies to comments prior to their
being filed with, or sent to, the SEC. Each of the Company, Parent and
Purchaser agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts, after consultation
with the other parties hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of
and requests by the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement and all required
amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of Shares
entitled to vote at the Stockholders Meeting at the earliest practicable
time. 

6.4(b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the Proxy Statement (i) will not, on the date it is first mailed to
stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under



 

52 which they are made, not misleading and (ii) will comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with
respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or
Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.
Parent shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
information supplied by Parent in writing for inclusion (or incorporation by
reference) in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date it is first mailed
to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading.

6.4(c) Parent and the Company shall promptly make all necessary filings with
respect to the Merger under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, applicable
Blue Sky Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.

6.5. _Company Board Representation; Section 14(f)_.

6.5(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Legal Requirements, promptly upon
the acceptance for payment of any Shares by Parent or Purchaser or any of
their affiliates pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Offer
(the "Appointment Time") and from time to time thereafter, and subject to
Section 6.5(c), Purchaser shall be entitled to designate up to such number of
directors, rounded up to the nearest whole number constituting at least
a majority of the directors, on the Company Board as will give Purchaser
representation on the Company Board equal to the product of the number of
directors on the Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of
directors pursuant to this Section 6.5) and the percentage that such number
of Shares beneficially owned by Parent or its Affiliates bears to the total
number of Shares then outstanding, and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to, upon Parents request, promptly, at Parents election,
either increase the size of the Board or seek and accept the resignation of
such number of directors as is necessary to enable Parents designees to be
elected or appointed to the Board and to cause Parents designees to be so
elected or appointed. At such times, subject to Section 6.5(c), the Company
will cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of
members of each committee of the Board, rounded up to the next whole number,
that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the
Board, other than any committee of the Board established to take action under
this Agreement which committee shall be composed only of Independent
Directors (as defined in Section 6.5(c)).

6.5(b) The Companys obligation to appoint designees to the Company Board
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all action required pursuant to
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder in order to
fulfill its obligations under this Section 6.5, and shall include in the
Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers
and directors as is required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14f-1 thereunder in order to



 

53 fulfill its obligations under this Section 6.5 and applicable Legal
Requirements. Parent shall timely provide to the Company, and shall be solely
responsible for, the information and consents with respect to Parent and its
designees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder.

6.5(c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or designated to the
Board, then, until the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Board to
have at least three directors who are members of the Company Board as of the
date of this Agreement and are independent directors for purposes of the
continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market (such directors,
the "Independent Directors"); provided, however, that, if any Independent
Director is unable to serve due to death or disability or any other reason,
the remaining Independent Directors shall be entitled to elect or designate
another individual (or individuals) (provided, that no such individual is an
employee of the Company or the Subsidiaries) to fill the vacancy, and such
director (or directors) shall be deemed to be an Independent Director (or
Independent Directors) for purposes of this Agreement. If no Independent
Director remains prior to the Effective Time, a majority of the members of the
Board at the time of the execution of this Agreement shall be entitled to
designate three persons to fill such vacancies; provided, that such
individuals shall not be employees or officers of the Company, Parent or
Purchaser, and shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and such persons
shall be deemed Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.
Following the Appointment Time and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment
or termination of this Agreement, any amendment to the Organizational
Documents of any Acquired Corporation, any extension by the Company of the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Purchaser
or Parent, any exercise of rights under this Agreement by the Company, any
waiver of any of the Companys rights under this Agreement, or any action
adversely affecting the rights of the stockholders (other than Parent or
Purchaser), shall not to be effected without the affirmative vote of a
majority of the Independent Directors.

6.6. _Access to Information_. The Acquired Corporations shall afford to
Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives,
reasonable access (subject to applicable Legal Requirements regarding the
sharing of information), during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice during the period prior to the Effective Time (or termination of this
Agreement), to its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and
records for purposes of conducting due diligence in a manner customary for
transactions of this type. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this Section 6.6 shall be conducted in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Acquired
Corporations or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of the Acquired Corporations. During such period, each of the Acquired
Corporations shall furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties, assets and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Parent will
hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with
the Confidentiality



 

54 Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant
to this Section or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent that providing Parent or Purchaser (i) access to any
documents or information of the Acquired Corporations would risk waiver of any
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege
applicable to such documents or information or (ii) access to a contract to
which any of the Acquired Corporations is a party or otherwise bound would
violate or cause a default under, or give a third party the right terminate or
accelerate the rights under, such contract, then the Acquired Corporations
will reasonably cooperate with Parent and Purchaser to provide them relevant
information with respect to such documents, information, or contracts in a
manner that does not cause any such waiver, violation or default, or give rise
to any such right of termination or acceleration.

6.7. _Legal Conditions to the Contemplated Transactions_. 

6.7(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.7(b), each of the
parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable, (ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain
from any Governmental Body or any other third party any consents, licenses,
permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders required to be

and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby that are
necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger, (iii) as promptly as
practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger
required under (A) the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any other
applicable federal or state securities laws, (B) to the extent set forth on
Part 6.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the HSR Act, any foreign
antitrust laws or regulations, and any related governmental request
thereunder, and (C) any other applicable Legal Requirements, and (iv) execute
or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. Each
of the parties hereto shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings (subject to applicable Legal Requirements regarding
the sharing of information), including providing copies of all such documents
to the non-filing party and its advisors with a reasonable opportunity for
review prior to filing and, if requested, accepting all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith. Each of the parties
hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts (subject to applicable Legal
Requirements regarding the sharing of information) to furnish to each other
all information required for any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable Legal Requirements
(including all information required to be included in the Proxy Statement) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto agree that nothing contained
in this Section 6.7(a) shall modify or affect their respective rights and
responsibilities under Section 6.7(b).



 

55 6.7(b) Subject to the terms hereof, Parent and the Company agree, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any government clearances,
approvals, actions, or non actions required for the Contemplated Transactions
under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other federal, state or
foreign law, regulation or decree designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
and/or competition (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"), to respond to any
government requests for information under any Antitrust Law, and to contest
and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial
action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits, or threatens to restrict,
prevent or prohibit, the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. The
parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in
good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. Parent shall be
entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with any Governmental Body
relating to any of the foregoing, provided that it shall afford the Company a
reasonable opportunity to participate therein. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall (i) keep
the other party informed of any communication received from, or given to, the
United States Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of
Justice, or any other United States or foreign Governmental Body and of any
communication received from or given to any Person (other than such partys
employees, agents, attorneys, representatives, advisors, consultants, or
affiliates) in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each
case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) permit
the other party to review in advance any communication given by the first
party to, and consult with the other party in advance of any meeting or
conference with, the United States Federal Trade Commission, the United States
Department of Justice, or any other United States or foreign Governmental Body
or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person (other than the employees, agents, attorneys, representatives,
advisors, consultants, or affiliates of Parent, the Company, or their
affiliates, as the case may be) and, to the extent permitted by the United
States Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice, or
any other United States or foreign Governmental Body or other Person, give the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.

6.7(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to, and the
Company shall not without the express prior written consent of Parent, make
proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to orders providing for
the sale, divestiture or other disposition or holding separate (through the
establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets of Parent or any of its
Affiliates or any material assets of the Company or any of its Affiliates or
the holding separate of the shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of stock
of the Surviving Corporation) or imposing or seeking to impose any material



 

56 limitation on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to conduct their
business or own such assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of
ownership of the shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of stock of the
Surviving Corporation) (any such event, a "Burdensome Condition").

6.7(d) At the request of Parent, the Acquired Corporations shall agree to hold
separate (including by trust or otherwise) or to divest any of their
respective businesses, Subsidiaries or assets, or to take or agree to take any
action with respect to, or agree to any limitation on, any of their respective
businesses, Subsidiaries or assets, provided that any such action
is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company agrees and
acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section,
none of the Acquired Corporations shall, without Parents prior written
consent, agree to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or to
divest any of their respective businesses, Subsidiaries or assets, or to take
or agree to take any action with respect to, or agree to any limitation on,
any of their respective businesses, Subsidiaries or assets.

6.7(e) Each of Parent and the Acquired Corporations shall give any notices to
third parties, and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third
party consents related to or required in connection with the Merger that are
(i) necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii)
required to prevent the occurrence of an event that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent prior to
or after the Effective Time.

6.8. _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by applicable Legal
Requirements or stock market regulations, (a) the press release announcing the
execution of this Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be
mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent, and (b) Parent and the Company
shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party
before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public
statement (including any press conference or conference call with investors or
analysts) with respect to the Merger or this Agreement; provided, however,
that each of Parent and the Company may make any public statement in response
to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors, stockholders or those
attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long
as any such statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the
Company and do not reveal non-public information regarding the other party.
Nothing contained in this Section 6.8 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from making any public disclosure or other public communication
permitted by Section 6.1.

6.9. _Stockholder Litigation_. In connection with any stockholder litigation
that may be brought against the Company or its directors relating to the
Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company shall keep Parent and Purchaser, and any counsel that Parent and
Purchaser may retain, informed of the status of such litigation and will
provide Parents and Purchasers counsel the right to participate in the
defense of such litigation to the extent Parent and Purchaser are
not otherwise a party thereto, and the Company shall not enter into any
settlement or compromise of any such stockholder litigation without Parents
and Purchasers prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.



 

57 6.10. _Indemnification_.

6.10(a) During the period set forth in the following sentence, Parent shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, cause the
Surviving Corporation, to honor all of the Companys obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless (without any amendment to such obligations) each present and
former director, officer and employee of any of the Acquired Corporations
(the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the extent that such obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless exist on the date of this Agreement (whether under the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, any indemnification agreement between the
Company and such Indemnified Person) or, if entered into after the date of
this Agreement in compliance with Section 5.1, at the Effective Time. Parents
obligations under the foregoing sentence shall begin at the Effective Time and
end on the date that is six (6) years following the Effective Time; provided,
that if, prior to the expiration of such six (6) year period, an obligation of
the Company to indemnify and hold harmless an Indemnified Party has arisen and
not been fully resolved, Parents obligations with respect thereto under the
foregoing sentence shall continue under such matter is fully resolved.

6.10(b) Prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company may purchase "tail"
officers and directors liability insurance policies reasonably acceptable to
the Company, that by their terms shall survive the Merger and shall provide
each Indemnified Party with coverage for six years following the Effective
Time on terms and conditions no less favorable than the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance ("Tail Policies"), provided that
the aggregate premium for such Tail Policies shall not be greater than 200% of
the annual premium paid by the Company for such existing insurance, and
provided, further, that if 200% of the annual premium paid by the Company for
such existing insurance is not sufficient to obtain such coverage, the Company
may elect either (i) to spend up to that amount to purchase such lesser
coverage as may be obtained with such amount or (ii) to request that Parent
purchase the Tail Policies in which case Parent shall do so. Such purchases by
Parent shall not be subject to the 200% cap. In any such purchase of the Tail
Policies by Parent or by the Company pursuant to this Section 10(b), the
Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent to obtain the highest quality
policies at the lowest cost. For a period of six years from the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such Tail Policies
in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations
thereunder for the full term thereof.

6.10(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall (and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar Organizational
Documents) of the Surviving



 

58 Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that are at least as
favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or other similar Organizational Documents) of the
Acquired Corporations immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, and
such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who
were covered by such provisions, except as required by applicable Legal
Requirements.

6.10(d) If, during the period set forth in the last sentence of Section
6.10(a), Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10.

6.10(e) The provisions of this Section are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives. During the period set forth in
the last sentence of Section 6.10(a), Parent shall guarantee the obligations
of the Surviving Corporation with respect to any and all amounts payable under
this Section 6.10.

6.11. _Employee Matters_.

6.11(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, on or before the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
to provide individuals who were employed by the Acquired Corporations
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who remain employees of the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective
Time (the "Continuing Employees") with benefits that are substantially
similar in the aggregate to those benefits provided to similarly situated
Parent employees; provided, however, that Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain the Plans through December 31, 2010 and
Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in such Plans in
accordance with their applicable terms through December 31, 2010.

6.11(b) With respect to any benefit plans, programs, and arrangements of
Parent or its Subsidiaries (the "Parent Plans") in which Continuing Employees
participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to, or shall cause such Subsidiaries to use commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to Continuing Employees to the extent such
limitations were waived or otherwise satisfied under the comparable Plans



 

59 and to the extent permitted by the terms of such Parent Plans or required by
applicable Legal Requirements, (ii) recognize all service of Continuing
Employees with the Acquired Corporations for purposes of eligibility to
participate in and vesting (and solely with respect to severance and paid time
off plans or arrangements, level of benefits), but not (A) to the extent such
recognition would result in duplication of benefits or (B) for purposes of
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or equity plan (except
as provided herein for assumed equity awards), and only to the same extent
such service would be taken into account under a comparable Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (iii) shall provide that any covered expenses
incurred on or before the Effective Time by a Continuing Employee or
a Continuing Employees covered dependent shall be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket provisions after the Effective Time to the same extent as such expenses
are taken into account for the benefit of similarly situated employees of
Parent and subsidiaries of Parent.

6.11(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause the other
Acquired Corporations to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with Parent in making any communications with current or former employees
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.11(d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are solely for the benefit of
the parties hereto and are not intended to and shall not confer upon any
current or former employee, officer, director, independent contractor or other
service provider of any Acquired Corporation, including any Continuing
Employee, any third party rights. In addition, the provisions of this Section
6.11 are not intended to, nor shall they be deemed to, amend any employee
benefit plan, including any Plan or any employee benefit plan of the Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries. 

6.11(e) With respect to the Severance and Change of Control Agreements between
Techwell and each of Fumihiro Kazoto, Feng Kuo, Dongwook (David) Nam, Mark
Voll and Yojiro (Joe) Kamei, dated as of April 23, 2007, July 31, 2007, July
31, 2007, April 23, 2007 and July 31, 2007, respectively (each, a "Change of
Control Agreement" and collectively, the "Change of Control Agreements"), the
Company shall take all actions necessary (including obtaining the written
consent of each employee party to a Change of Control Agreement) such that,
effective as of the Acceptance Date, (i) each Change of Control Agreement is

performance of any of the obligations or other acts of such party to this
Agreement, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representation and warranties
contained in this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant to this

conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party
to this Agreement to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party.

the Acceptance Date.

change thereto) unless and until such party shall have executed this Agreement
or such document on paper by a handwritten original signature or any other
symbol executed or adopted by a party with current intention to authenticate

any of the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties: (a)

inconvenient forum to the maintenance



 

67 of such action or proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of

action or proceeding may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in Section 9.13. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Legal

EIGHTH: (1) _Exculpation_. To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware
Corporation Law, as the same exists or as may hereafter be amended, a director
of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.
If the Delaware Corporation Law hereafter is amended to further eliminate or
limit the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the
Corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal liability provided
herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by the amended
Delaware Corporation Law. Any repeal or modification of this paragraph by the
stockholders of the Corporation shall be prospective only and shall not
adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the
Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

(2) _Indemnification_.

(a) _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
otherwise (hereinafter a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she
is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while serving as a
director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter
an "Indemnitee"), whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in
an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall
be indemnified and held harmless and advanced expenses by the Corporation, in
accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation, to the fullest extent
authorized by the Delaware Corporation Law, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, except as may
be prohibited by applicable law, only to the extent that such amendment
permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than
permitted prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts
paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee in
connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to
an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitees heirs, executors and
administrators.



 

C-2 (b) _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_ The rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses conferred in this Section shall not be exclusive of
any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute or the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

(c) _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense,
to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the Delaware Corporation Law.

(d) _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation_. The
Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of
Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and to the advancement of expenses
to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the
provisions of this Section with respect to the indemnification and advancement
of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

(e) _Amendment_. Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article EIGHTH, nor
the adoption of any provision of the Corporations Certificate of
Incorporation inconsistent with this Article EIGHTH, shall eliminate or reduce
the effect of this Article EIGHTH in respect of any matter occurring, or
action or proceeding accruing or arising or that, but for this Article
EIGHTH, would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of
an inconsistent provision.

_INDEMNIFICATION_

4.1. _RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION_. The Company shall indemnify to the fullest
extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware any
person who was or is party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (a "proceeding"), by reason of the
fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or a
constituent corporation absorbed in a consolidation or merger, or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or a constituent corporation absorbed in
a consolidation or merger, as a director or officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or is or was a
director or officer of the Company serving at its request as an administrator,
trustee or other fiduciary of one or more of the employee benefit plans of the
Company or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees),
liability and loss actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person
in connection with such proceeding, whether or not the indemnified liability
arises or arose from any threatened, pending or completed proceeding by or in
the right of the Company, except to the extent that such indemnification is
prohibited by applicable law; provided, however, that except as provided in
_Section 4.3_, the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board.

4.2. _PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINING PERMISSIBILITY_. To obtain indemnification
under this _Article IV_ , a claimant shall submit to the corporation a written
request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as
is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to
determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to
indemnification. Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification
pursuant to the preceding sentence, a determination, if required by applicable
law, with respect to the claimants entitlement thereto shall be made by
Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined) selected by the claimant unless
the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the Board. If it is
so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the
claimant shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination. 

4.3. _CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION_. If a claim for the indemnification under
this _Article IV_  is not paid in full by the corporation within thirty (30)
days after a written claim pursuant to _Section 4.2_ has been received by the
corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other
than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending
any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required
undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation) that
the claimant has not met the standard of conduct that makes it permissible
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the corporation
to indemnify the claimant   for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on
the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board
of directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of
the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the corporation
(including its board of directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) that
the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a
defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met
the applicable standard of conduct. If a determination shall have been made
pursuant to this _Section 4.3_ that the claimant is entitled to
indemnification, the corporation shall be bound by such determination in any
judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to _Section 4.3_. The corporation
shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced
pursuant to _Section 4.3_ that the procedures and presumptions of this
_Article IV_ are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in
such proceeding that the corporation is bound by all the provisions of this
_Article IV_.

4.4. _ADVANCE PAYMENT_. The right to indemnification under this _Article IV_
shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred
in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, such
advances to be paid by the corporation within twenty (20) days after the
receipt by the corporation of a statement or statements from the claimant
requesting such advance or advances from time to time; provided, however, that
if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware requires, the payment
of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as
a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or
is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including service to
an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a
proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay all amounts
so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer
is not entitled to be indemnified under this _Article IV_ or otherwise.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to 
_Section 4.6_, no advance shall be made by the corporation to an officer of
the corporation (except by reason of the fact that such officer is or was a
director of the corporation, in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in
any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the
Board by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than
a quorum, or (B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by
majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum,
or (C) if there are no Disinterested Directors or the Disinterested Directors
so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy
of which shall be delivered to the claimant, that the facts known to the
decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate
clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner
that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the corporation. 4.5. _CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION_. The obligations of the Company to indemnify a
director or officer under this _Article IV_ , including the duty to advance
expenses, shall be considered a contract between the Company and such director
or officer, and no modification or repeal of any provision of this
_Article IV_ shall affect, to the detriment of the director or officer, such
obligations of the Company in connection with a claim based on any act or
failure to act occurring before such modification or repeal.

4.6. _NON-EXCLUSIVITY AND SURVIVAL OF RIGHTS; AMENDMENTS_. The right to
indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a
proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this _Article IV_
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right which any person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of
incorporation of the corporation, bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
Disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in such persons
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding
such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Any
repeal or modification of the provisions of this _Article IV_ shall not in
any way diminish or adversely affect the rights of any director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation hereunder in respect of any occurrence or
matter arising prior to any such repeal or modification. Insurance and Other
Indemnification.

4.7. _INSURANCE_. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any
expense, liability or loss asserted against such person and incurred by such
person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as
such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such
person against such liability under the provisions of the General Corporation
Law of State of Delaware.

4.8. _______SEVERABILITY_. If any word, clause, provision or provisions of
this _Article IV_ shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for
any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Article 6 (including each portion of any section
or paragraph of this Article 6 containing any such provision held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby; and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this
_Article IV_ (including each such portion of any section or paragraph of this
_Article IV_ containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent
manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable. 4.9. ___Definitions_. For the purpose of this _Article IV_ : 

"Independent Counsel" shall mean a law firm, a member of a law firm, or an
independent practitioner, that is experienced in matters of corporation law
and shall include any person who, under the applicable standards of
professional conduct then prevailing, would not have a conflict of interest in
representing either the corporation or the claimant in an action to determine
the claimants rights under this Article IV.

4.10. _NOTICES_. Any notice, request or other communication required or
permitted to be given to the corporation under this _Article IV_ shall be in
writing and either delivered in person or sent by telecopy, telex, telegram,
overnight mail or courier service, or certified or registered mail, postage
or charges prepaid, return copy requested, to the Secretary of the corporation
and shall be effective only upon receipt by the Secretary.

ARTICLE V.

_TRANSFER OF SHARE CERTIFICATES _

Transfers of share certificates and the shares represented thereby shall be
made on the books of the Company only by the registered holder or by duly
authorized attorney. Transfers shall be made only on surrender of the share
certificate or certificates.

ARTICLE VI.

_AMENDMENTS_
