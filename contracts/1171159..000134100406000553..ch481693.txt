("Parent"), KTHP Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Newco"), and Packaging Dynamics
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, the board of directors of Newco and the board of managers of
Parent have unanimously approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; and

         WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Board of
Directors") has (i) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders to adopt the Agreement and to consummate the
acquisition of the Company by Parent and Newco upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Agreement, (iii) determined that the cash
consideration to be received for the Shares, in the Merger is fair to the
stockholders of the Company who will receive such consideration, and (iv)
recommended to the stockholders of the Company to vote to approve this
Agreement and the Merger;

         WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and as a condition to Parent's and Newco's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, each of the stockholders of the Company listed on Exhibit A
hereto (the "Principal Stockholders"), Parent and Newco will enter into voting
agreements, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Voting Agreements"),
pursuant to which, among other things, such Principal Stockholders will agree
to vote their Shares to approve this Agreement and the Merger, upon the terms

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, Parent,

separate corporate existence of Newco shall thereupon cease, (b) the Company
shall be the successor or surviving corporation in the Merger and shall

as the case may be, to take, and shall take, any and all such lawful action.

         1.2 Effective Time. Parent, Newco and the Company will cause a

agree in writing) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as
provided in the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required by
the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective on
the date on which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later date as is agreed
upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, and such date
is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time."

         1.3 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place (a) at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, 333 West

in Article VII hereof shall be fulfilled or waived in accordance with this
Agreement (other than such conditions which by their terms are not capable of
being satisfied until the Closing) or (b) at such other place, time and date as
Parent and the Company may agree in writing (the "Closing Date").

                                  ARTICLE II

                             SURVIVING CORPORATION

         2.1 Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of incorporation of

certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

         2.2 By-laws. The by-laws of Newco, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

         2.3 Directors. The directors of Newco immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation's certificate of
incorporation and by-laws.

         2.4 Officers. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial

                                  ARTICLE III

    MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF SHARES IN THE MERGER

         3.1 Share Consideration for the Merger; Conversion or Cancellation of
Shares in the Merger. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders of any outstanding shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Shares") or
capital stock of Newco:

                  (a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by the Parent and any of its direct
or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries (the "Parent Companies"), any of the
Company's direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries, Shares held in the
treasury of the Company, or Shares held by stockholders properly exercising
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL) shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Newco, the Company or the holder
thereof, be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive,
pursuant to Section 3.4, $14.00 in cash (the "Merger Consideration"), payable
to the holder thereof, less any required withholding of taxes, without interest
thereon.

                  (b) At the Effective Time, each Share issued and outstanding
and owned by any of the Parent Companies or any of the Company's direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries or held in the treasury of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding (if
applicable), be cancelled, retired and cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

                  (c) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of
Newco issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (d) On and after the Effective Time, holders of certificates
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the
"Certificates") shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company,
except the right to receive the consideration set forth in this Article III for
each Share held by them. All Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Shares.

                  (e) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, the Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or
other form of security or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, division, combination or exchange of
shares, or rights issued in respect of the Shares, or other like changes in the
Company's capitalization, there will be a proportionate adjustment made to the
Merger Consideration to reflect such change.

         3.2 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a stockholder who has not voted in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded and
perfected their rights to be paid the fair value of such Shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into
a right to receive the Merger Consideration unless such stockholder fails to
perfect or waives, withdraws or otherwise loses his or her right to appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL. A holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by him or her in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after the Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect or waives, withdraws or loses his or her right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, in which case such Shares shall be
treated as Shares that had been converted as of the Effective Time into only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding of
taxes, without interest thereon, in accordance with Section 3.1. The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notices of dissent, written demands
for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the DGCL. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
shall not make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle
or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

         3.3 Stockholders' Meeting and Proxy.

                  (a) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and
its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a special meeting of the Company's stockholders (the "Stockholders'
Meeting"), for the purpose of considering the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the Merger as soon as practicable following the date hereof,
regardless of whether the Board of Directors determines at any time that this
Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends that the stockholders of the
Company reject it or any other Company Adverse Recommendation has occurred at
any time; provided that unless otherwise requested in writing by Parent, with
reasonable advance notice, the date of the Stockholders' Meeting shall be no
earlier than May 15, 2006; provided, further, that the Company may extend the
date of the Stockholders' Meeting to the extent (i) necessary in order to obtain
a quorum of its stockholders or (ii) the Company reasonably determines that such
delay is required by applicable Law.

                  (b) Subject to Section 6.2, the Company shall, through its
Board of Directors, recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement;

                  (c) As promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement (but in any event within fifteen (15) business days following the date
hereof), the Company shall prepare and file a preliminary proxy statement
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger (the
"Preliminary Proxy Statement") with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"), and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and furnish the information required to be included by it in the Proxy
Statement and, after consultation with Parent and Newco, respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement
and any preliminary version thereof and cause a definitive proxy statement (the
"Definitive Proxy Statement", and together with the Preliminary Proxy Statement,
the "Proxy Statement") to be mailed to its stockholders as soon as is reasonably
practicable following the date hereof.

                  (d) Each party shall promptly notify the other parties upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall
provide the other parties with copies of all correspondence between it and its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand
relating to the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Stockholders'
Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and the
parties shall cooperate (which shall include providing each other with an
opportunity to review and comment) in the prompt filing with the SEC of an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, in disseminating the information contained in
such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company.

                  (e) Subject to Section 6.2, the Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and (ii) take all other
action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders
required by applicable Law to obtain such approvals.

                  (f) At such meeting, Parent, Newco and their affiliates will
vote all Shares owned by them in favor of adoption of this Agreement, approval
of the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby.

         3.4 Payment for Shares in the Merger. The manner of making payment for
Shares in the Merger shall be as follows:

                  (a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to a bank or
trust company selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent") for the benefit of the holders of Shares, the funds necessary
to make the payments contemplated by Section 3.1 (the "Exchange Fund"). The
Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration out of the Exchange Fund. Pending distribution of the Exchange
Fund pursuant to Section 3.4(b) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall be held in trust
for the benefit of the holders of the Shares and the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purposes, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation may direct
the Exchange Agent to invest such cash, provided that such investments (i) shall
be obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, commercial
paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moody's Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation, or certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of domestic commercial banks
with capital exceeding $250,000,000 (collectively "Permitted Investments") or
money market funds which are invested solely in Permitted Investments and (ii)
shall have maturities that will not prevent or delay payments to be made
pursuant to Section 3.4(b) hereof. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments remaining after nine months from the Effective Date and
thereafter shall be paid to Parent.

                  (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record (other than
holders of certificates for Shares referred to in Section 3.1(b)) of a
Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates for payment therefor. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal
duly executed and any other required documents, the holder of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive for each of the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificates the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding of
taxes, without any interest thereon, and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. If payment is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name a Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.4(b), each
Certificate (other than Certificates formerly representing Shares held by the
Parent Companies or any of the Company's direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries or held in the treasury of the Company) shall represent for all
purposes only the right to receive, for each Share formerly represented
thereby, the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding of taxes,
without interest thereon.

                  (c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund made available to the
Exchange Agent which remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the
Company for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand of the Surviving Corporation, and any former
stockholders of the Company shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration for the
Shares.

                  (d) None of Parent, Newco, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any retained Shares
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

                  (e) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct
and withhold in respect of such Shares under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of whom
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent.

         3.5 Transfer of Shares Immediately Prior to the Effective Time. No
transfers of Shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Company
after the close of business on the day prior to the date of the Effective Time.

         3.6 Stock Options and Other Equity Incentive Awards Prior to the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions
necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each unexpired and unexercised option, restricted stock units or similar
rights to purchase Shares ("Options"), as set forth in Section 4.2 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, and which have been granted under any compensatory
stock option plan or any other equity-based plans, agreements or arrangements
of or with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for the granting of
options or other equity-based awards (collectively, the "Option Plans"),
including, without limitation, the Packaging Dynamics Corporation 2005
Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan or 2002 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan or any
predecessor plans thereto, and that is outstanding at the Effective Time,
whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Option shall be entitled to
receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Option and in settlement
therefor, a payment in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or other
taxes required by applicable Law to be withheld) of an amount equal to the
product of (a) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration minus the
exercise or reference price per Share of each such Option and (b) the number of
Shares covered by such Option (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to
as the "Option Payment"). From and after the Effective Time, any such cancelled
Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall
only entitle such holder to the payment of the Option Payment, without interest
thereon. Prior to the Closing, the Company and Parent shall each use its
reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers or releases, if
any, from holders of such Options and take such actions to give effect to, and
accomplish, the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.6, including but

                                  ARTICLE IV

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Newco that:

         4.1 Corporate Organization and Qualification. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and (to the extent the
concept of good standing exists in the applicable jurisdiction) in good
standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization. Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and (if
applicable) in good standing in each jurisdiction where the properties owned,
leased or operated, or the business conducted by it require such qualification,
except where failure to so qualify or be in good standing has not had and would
not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate or other power and authority
to own its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where failure to have such power and authority has not had
and would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has heretofore made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws or other organizational documents
of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as presently in effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material violation of any provision
of its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or similar organizational
document.

         4.2 Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 40,000,000 Shares and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par

and outstanding, (ii) no shares of preferred stock of the Company are issued
and outstanding, (iii) no Shares are issued and held in the treasury of the
Company and (iv) 1,363,301 Shares are reserved for issuance upon the exercise

Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable, and not subject to or issued in violation of any purchase
option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription
right or any similar right under any provision of the DGCL, the Company's
certificate of incorporation or by-laws or any Contract to which the Company is
a party or otherwise bound. Except as set forth in Section 4.2 of the
disclosure schedule delivered by the Company herewith (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule"), all outstanding shares of capital stock of or comparable equity
interests in the Company's Subsidiaries are owned by the Company or a direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of all Liens.
Other than the equity of its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly
or indirectly, any Investments or other equity interests in any other person.
Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Company's
Subsidiaries having corporate form is duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable. Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true and complete list of the names, jurisdictions of organization and
capitalization of each of the Company's Subsidiaries and, for the Company and
each Subsidiary, the jurisdictions in which it is qualified to do business.
Section 4.2 of the Disclosure Schedules lists each Option outstanding on the
date hereof, the Plan under which such Option was granted, the number of Shares
issuable thereunder, the vesting schedule, the expiration date and the exercise
price thereof. Except as set forth in Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are not any outstanding or authorized options, warrants, calls,
rights (including preemptive rights), convertible or exchangeable securities,
"phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-based performance
units, commitments, contracts, undertakings or any other arrangements of any
character to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by
which any of them may be bound, (i) requiring any of them to issue, transfer,
sell, purchase, redeem or acquire, or cause to be issued, transferred, sold,
purchased, redeemed or acquired, any shares of capital stock or any securities
or rights convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to
subscribe for, any shares of capital stock of or comparable equity interests in
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) obligating the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such option,
warrant, call, right, security, commitment, contract, undertaking or
arrangement or (iii) that give any person the right to receive any economic
benefit or right similar to or derived from the economic benefits and rights
accruing to holders of the capital stock of the Company. Except as set forth in
Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the best knowledge of the
Company, there are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts, proxies or other
agreements, instruments or understandings with respect to the voting of the
capital stock of the Company. No dividends on the Shares have been declared or

of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law);

delivery of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its obligations
hereunder, nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated

consent, approval, authorization or permit, or to make such filing or
notification, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (vii) where the
requirement to obtain such consent, approval, authorization or permit, or to
make such filing or notification, has or will become applicable as a result of
the activities or status of Parent or Newco;

                  (c) except as set forth in Section 4.4(c) of the Company

right of termination, cancellation or acceleration or lien or other charge or
encumbrance or to loss of a material benefit under, or to material increased,
additional or accelerated costs) or require consent under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, license, agreement, Contract, Employment
Agreement or other instrument or obligation, whether written or oral, to which
or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets may

not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

                  (d) except as set forth in Section 4.4(d) of the Company

Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or any termination of

increase any benefits otherwise payable by the Company or any Subsidiary or
(iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such

or other property) under any of the Benefit Plans or any other contract,
agreement or arrangement with respect to which the Company or any Subsidiary of

income tax purposes by virtue of Section 404 or Section 280G of the Code.

party contract labor suppliers, temporary employees, "leased employees" (as
that term is defined in Section 414(n) of the Code), or individuals who have
provided services as independent contractors to an extent that would reasonably
be expected to result in the disqualification of any of the Benefit Plans or
the imposition of penalties or excise taxes with respect to the Plans by the
Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, or the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation.

"Scheduled Intellectual Property"). The entire right, title and interest in the
Scheduled Intellectual Property is solely owned by the Companies or its
Subsidiaries. Each of the registered or applied for Scheduled Intellectual
Property has been duly registered or application filed with the appropriate

                  (b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries owns or
possesses the valid rights to exploit all Intellectual Property exploited in
the operation of their business, free and clear of any Liens, in the manner and
for the purposes that such rights are exploited in their business, except where
failure to so own or possess, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. "Intellectual

Disclosure Schedule, and except for such claims which, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect, there are no actual or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened opposition proceedings, cancellation proceedings, interference
proceedings or other similar action challenging the validity, enforceability,
and ownership of any portion of the Scheduled Intellectual Property. None of
the Scheduled Intellectual Property has been previously adjudged to be invalid
or unenforceable in whole or in part except as disclosed in Section 4.13(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule.

                  (d) Except as set forth in Section 4.13(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, and except for such claims which would not have a Material
Adverse Effect, no claims are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened that the conduct of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' respective
businesses has or does infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the
Intellectual Property of any person. Except as set forth in Section 4.13(d), to
the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
have received any "invitations to license" or other communications asserting
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be obligated to take license
under third party Intellectual Property rights to continue to conducting
business in the ordinary course.

                  (e) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, with
respect to the Scheduled Intellectual Property, proprietary product designs,
confidential marketing plans and business methods, proprietary data, and
computer software owned or purported to be owned by the Company or any
Subsidiary (collectively, "Owned Intellectual Property"), the Company or a
Subsidiary is the owner of the entire right, title and interest in and to such
Owned Intellectual Property (except for portions thereof that may consist of
embedded third party products licensed from others) and is entitled to use,
sell, license, transfer, and otherwise exploit such Owned Intellectual Property
in the continued operation of its respective business consistent with past
practice. To the knowledge of the Company, the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted does not infringe upon,
misappropriate or violate any copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade
names, trade secrets and patents of any third party. Except as set forth in
Schedule 4.13(e), neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has exclusively
licensed any Owned Intellectual Property to any person. To the knowledge of the
Company, no person has engaged in any activity that has infringed upon the
Owned Intellectual Property in any material respect. The Company and its
Subsidiaries take commercially reasonable actions to protect, preserve and
maintain the Owned Intellectual Property and to retain the confidentiality of

the Company, there has been no unauthorized disclosure of any material trade
secrets or confidential information of the Company.

law, statute, rule or regulation having the effect of law of the United States
or any state, county, city or other political subdivision thereof or of any
government or regulatory authority ("Laws") or writ, judgment, decree,
injunction or similar order of any governmental or regulatory authority, in
each case, whether preliminary or final, applicable to the Company or any
Subsidiary or any of their respective assets and properties the effect of
which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries has in

local, all licenses, permits, authorizations, approvals, franchises and rights
("Governmental Approvals") that are necessary for the Company or its
Subsidiaries to engage in the business currently conducted by the Company and
its Subsidiaries, except in those instances in which failure to possess
Governmental Approvals, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth
in Section 4.14 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its
Subsidiaries are not now, and during the last three years have not been, the
subject of any complaint, charge, citation, investigation, audit, suit or other
legal process with respect to any of its employees, or any of the terms or
conditions of their employment, by any federal, state, or local governmental
agency, including the U.S. Department of Labor, the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, the National Labor Relations
Board, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance or any state agency comparable
to any of the foregoing, except as, individually or in the aggregate, have not

Schedule lists each parcel of Owned Real Property.

                  (b) The Company or one of its Subsidiaries has a valid

sublease relating thereto and Permitted Liens. Other than (i) leases with a
remaining term of three (3) months or less and monthly rental payments less
than $5,000 or (ii) month-to-month leases that are terminable by the Company
upon one month's prior notice and monthly rental payments less than $5,000,

enforceability of any Contract (including as a result of the execution and
performance of this Agreement), (iii) to the Company's knowledge, no event has
occurred that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would result in
a breach or a default under any Contract, (iv) each of the Contracts is in full
force and effect, and is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and to the Company's knowledge, of the other
parties thereto, and (v) the Company and its Subsidiaries have performed all
respective material obligations required to be performed by them to date under
the Contracts and are not (with or without the lapse of time or the giving of
notice, or both) in material breach thereunder.

     consideration in excess of $1,000,000;

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; or

                  (d) assuming the consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits and filings or notifications referred to in this Section 5.3 are duly
and timely obtained or made, violate any order, writ, injunction, decree,
statute, rule or regulation applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
to any of their respective assets, except for violations which would not

         6.2    Acquisition Proposals.

                  (a) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company
and its Subsidiaries will not, and will use their reasonable best efforts to
cause their respective officers, directors, employees and investment bankers,
attorneys, financial advisors, accountants or other advisors, agents or
representatives (collectively, "Representatives") retained by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any parties (other than Parent, Newco and
their respective representatives) that may be ongoing with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company
and its Subsidiaries will not, and will not authorize their respective
officers, directors, employees or Representatives to directly or indirectly (i)
initiate, solicit, propose or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making
of any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) except as permitted below in Section 6.2(d)
or to inform persons of the existence of the provisions contained in this
Section 6.2, engage in negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any
non-public information or data to, any person relating to, in connection with
or which would reasonably likely lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall promptly inform its, and its Subsidiaries', directors, officers,
employees and Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section
6.2. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any of Company's
Subsidiaries or any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' officers, directors,
employees or Representatives shall be a breach of this Section 6.2 by the
Company.

                  (b) Except as provided in this Section 6.2(b), the Board of
Directors (or any committee thereof) shall not and shall not publicly propose
to (i) withdraw, modify or change in a manner adverse to Parent the Company
Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or
Superior Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, acquisition agreement or similar agreement constituting or relating
to, or that is intended to or would be reasonably expected to result in an
Acquisition Proposal (other than any confidentiality agreement as permitted by
paragraph (d) of this Section 6.2) (any action described in clause (i), (ii) or
(iii), a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to the Stockholders' Meeting, in response to an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, if the Board of Directors (A)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal, (B) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) based on such matters as it deems
appropriate that the failure to do so would cause it not to be in compliance
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (C) is not otherwise in
violation of this Section 6.2, then the Company may in connection with such
Superior Proposal, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; provided, that
the Board of Directors shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
unless (I) the Company has given Parent three (3) business days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action and (II) in the case of an action
described in clause (ii) or (iii) above, (x) the Board of Directors shall have
considered and negotiated with Parent in good faith regarding proposed changes
to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, (y) the Company has complied
in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.2 and (z)
the Company shall have terminated this Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 8.4(ii) and 8.6(e) hereof.

                  (c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48
hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of the Company's receipt of any
request for information or any Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and
conditions of such request or Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of
the person making such request or Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed in all material respects of the status and details
of any such Acquisition Proposal.

                  (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
provided that in no event shall this Section 6.2(d) affect or limit the
obligations of the Company and the Board of Directors under Sections 6.2(a),
(b) or (c), the Company and the Board of Directors

                        (i) prior to Stockholders' Meeting, may participate in
     discussions or negotiations with or furnish information to any person in
     connection with an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by
     such person received after the date hereof, if and only to the extent that
     prior to taking such action the Board of Directors (A) determines in good
     faith (after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel and a
     financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that such
     Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result
     in a Superior Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal was not, directly or
     indirectly, the result of a breach of this Section 6.2 and (B) receives
     from such person an executed confidentiality agreement, the terms of which
     are substantially similar to and no less favorable to the Company than
     those contained in the Confidentiality Agreements; and

                        (ii) shall be permitted to (A) take and disclose to the
     Company's stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the
     Exchange Act or make a statement required under Rule 14a-9 under the
     Exchange Act and (B) make any disclosure with respect to an Acquisition
     Proposal to the Company's stockholders that is required by applicable Law.

If requested to do so by a third party, the Company may waive the provisions of
any "standstill" agreement between the Company and such person solely to the
extent necessary and for the limited purpose of permitting such person to
submit an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors
believes, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial
advisors), is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal.


                  (e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal"
means any inquiry, proposal or offer made by any person other than Parent,
Newco or any affiliate thereof relating to (i) the acquisition of, other than
in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (x) the Company, (y)
beneficial ownership (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of
25% or more of any class of capital stock of the Company pursuant to a merger,
consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock,
tender offer or exchange offer or similar transaction involving the Company
including, without limitation, any single or multistep transaction or series of
related transactions which is structured in good faith to permit such person to
acquire beneficial ownership of 25% or more of any class of capital stock of
the Company or (z) 25% or more of the fair market value of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) any other merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

                  (f) The term "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal (with all of the percentages included in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal increased to 80%) not solicited or initiated in violation
of this Agreement, which the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation
and legal counsel) to be (i) more favorable (taking into account all the terms
and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to
the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
offer or otherwise)) to the holders of Shares (in their capacities as
stockholders) from a financial point of view than the transactions provided for
in this Agreement and (ii) reasonably capable of being completed, taking into
account all financial, legal, regulatory, financing commitments and
contingencies and other aspects of such proposal.

         6.3 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, including the provisions of Section 6.2, each of
the parties hereto shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective as soon as
reasonably practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using its reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary or appropriate
waivers, consents and approvals, to effect all necessary registrations, filings
and submissions (including, but not limited to, (i) filings under the HSR Act
and any other submissions requested by the Federal Trade Commission or
Department of Justice and (ii) such filings, consents, approvals, orders
registrations and declarations as may be required under the Laws of any country
other than the United States in which the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries conducts any business or owns any assets) and to lift
any injunction or other legal bar to the Merger (and, in such case, to proceed
with the Merger as expeditiously as possible), subject, however, to the
requisite votes of the stockholders of the Company, if applicable. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to satisfy the
other conditions of Closing set forth herein and to cooperate with all
reasonable requests made by the other parties. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
consents, amendments to or waivers from other parties under the terms of all
leases and other agreements between the Company and such parties required as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and obtain all
necessary consents, approvals and authorizations as are required to be obtained
under any federal or state Law. The Parties shall consult regularly with each
other in advance and from time to time regarding the conduct and status of any
filings with Governmental Entities. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to require any party to waive any provision of this Agreement or any other
substantial rights or agree to any substantial limitation on its operations or
to dispose of any significant asset or collection of assets. Between the date
hereof and the Closing, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event or circumstance the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate if made at such time and
(b) any failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or
satisfy any of such party's covenants, conditions or agreements to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery or
non-delivery of any notice required to be sent pursuant to this Section 6.3
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice.

         6.4 Financing. At the sole cost and expense of Parent (including the
Company's reasonable attorneys' and other out-of-pocket fees and expenses), the
Company shall use, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use, commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate and assist Parent with respect to the
Financing. The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their Representatives to provide on a timely basis, all commercially
reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing
as may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided, that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in meetings,
drafting sessions and due diligence sessions led by Parent, (ii) furnishing
Parent and its financing sources with financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including
without limitation all financial statements and financial data of the type
required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act as well
as of the type and form customarily included in private placements under Rule
144A of the Securities Act, (iii) assisting Parent and its financing sources
and counsel in the preparation by Parent of (A) an offering document for any of
the Debt Financing and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv)
reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing
sources for any of the Debt Financing, (v) providing and executing documents as
may be reasonably requested by Parent, including a certificate of the chief
financial officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
solvency matters and assisting Parent in obtaining comfort letters of the
Company's accountants, consents of the Company's accountants for use of their
reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing, legal opinions of the
Company's counsel and surveys and title insurance with respect to the Owned
Real Property; (vi) assisting in the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Exhibit C to the Senior Secured Financing Letter and in Section 3 of Bridge
Financing Letter (in each case to the extent the satisfaction of such
conditions requires actions by or cooperation of the Company or its
Subsidiaries), (vii) making senior officers and representatives of the Company
reasonably available for presentations to ratings agencies, and (viii)
reasonably facilitating the pledge of the Surviving Corporation's collateral;
provided, that none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required
to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in
connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time. All non-public
or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company obtained by Parent
or its representatives pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreements; provided, that Parent and
its Representatives shall be permitted to disclose information as necessary and
consistent with customary practices in connection with the Debt Financing so
long as the parties who receive such information are informed of the
confidential nature of the information or upon the prior consent of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

         6.5 Access to Information. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall
(and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to officers, employees,
counsel, accountants and other authorized Representatives of Parent, in order
to evaluate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, reasonable access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice throughout the period
prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books and records and, during
such period, shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to such Representatives all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested; provided, however,
that the Company may restrict the foregoing access and information to the
extent that (i) applicable Laws require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties, books, records or
information or (ii) the information is subject to confidentiality obligations
to a third party. Parent agrees that it will not, and will cause its
Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section
6.5 for any competitive or other purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement,
dated November 7, 2005 (the "Thilmany Confidentiality Agreement"), by and
between the Company and Parent, and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
January 24, 2006 (the "Packaging Dynamics Confidentiality Agreement", together
with the Thilmany Confidentiality Agreement, the "Confidentiality Agreements")
shall apply with respect to information furnished by the parties hereunder,
their Subsidiaries and their officers, employees, counsel, accountants and
other authorized representatives hereunder; provided, that Parent and its
Representatives shall be permitted to disclose information as necessary and
consistent with customary practice in connection with the Debt Financing so
long as the parties who receive such information are informed of the
confidential nature of the information or upon the prior consent of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The
parties acknowledge that the Confidentiality Agreements shall remain in full
force and effect until the Closing. No investigation by Parent shall diminish
or obviate any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of
the Company contained in this Agreement.

         6.6 Publicity. The parties will consult with each other and will
mutually agree upon any press releases or public announcements pertaining to
the Merger and shall not issue any such press releases or make any such public
announcements prior to such consultation and agreement, except as may be
required by applicable Laws or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with any national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to
issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use its
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing
any such press releases or making any such public announcements.

         6.7 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

                  (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
any person who is now, has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or
becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer, director, employee or agent
(the "Indemnified Party") of the Company or its Subsidiaries (i) to the fullest
extent permitted under Delaware Law, to the same extent such persons are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the
Company's certificate of incorporation and the Company by-laws and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement
with any directors and officers of the Company against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, losses, and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or
investigation (each a "Claim") to the extent that any such Claim is based on,
or arises out of, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, and (ii) without limitation to clause (i), to the
fullest extent permitted under Delaware Law, in each case to the extent that
any such Claim pertains to any matter or fact arising, existing or occurring
prior to or at the Effective Time (including to the extent that any such Claim
is based on, or arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, other than in each case for Claims
judicially determined to involve a wilful breach of this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event any Indemnified Party becomes involved in
any capacity in any Claim, then from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance periodically and
promptly upon a request therefor to such Indemnified Party its legal and other
expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in
connection therewith), subject to the provision by such Indemnified Party of an
undertaking to reimburse the amounts so advanced in the event of a
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party
is not entitled thereto.

                  (b) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to
indemnification and all limitations of liability existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the Company's certificate of incorporation and
by-laws and indemnification agreements as in effect as of the date hereof shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, without any
amendment thereto, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time;
provided that, in the event any Claim or Claims are asserted or made within
such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of each such
Claim shall continue until disposition of any and all such Claims; provided
further that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an
Indemnified Party's conduct complies with the standards set forth under
applicable Laws, the Company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or such
agreements, as the case may be, shall be made by independent legal counsel
selected by the Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to Parent; and
provided further that nothing in this Section 6.7 shall impair any rights or
obligations of any present or former directors or officers of the Company;

                  (c) Parent shall provide for not less than six (6) years from
the Effective Time policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance (the "D&O Insurance") that provides substantially
the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less favorable
in the aggregate than the Company's policies existing on the date of this
Agreement for the Indemnified Parties and any other employees, agents or other
individuals otherwise covered by such insurance policies prior to the Effective
Time (collectively, the "Insured Parties") with respect to matters occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); provided, that Parent shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 150% of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
this Section 6.7(c), which policies provide such directors and officers with
coverage that is no less favorable in the aggregate than the Company's policies
existing on the date of this Agreement for an aggregate period of six (6) years
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as set forth in Section
6.7(a) hereof; provided, however, that without Parent's prior written consent,
Company shall not pay more than $425,000 to purchase such policy; and provided,
further, however, that prior to purchasing any such policy, Company shall
afford Parent the opportunity to purchase a substitute policy on terms not
materially less favorable to such directors and officers. If such prepaid
policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force
and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

                  (d) this Section 6.7 is intended to benefit the Insured
Parties, including the Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent, Newco, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation. Parent hereby guarantees the payment and performance by the
Surviving Corporation of the indemnification and other obligations pursuant to
this Section 6.7 and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation; and

                  (e) in the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns and transferees of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective successors or assigns,
as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

         6.8 Employees.

                  (a) Parent agrees to provide employee benefit plans,
programs, arrangements and policies for the benefit of employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (excluding any equity incentive or defined benefit plans,
programs or arrangements) (i) for a period of nine (9) months following the
Effective Time, that in the aggregate are no less favorable to such employees
than the Company Benefit Plans and (ii) for the three (3) month period
immediately thereafter, that in the aggregate are no less favorable to such
employees of the Parent holding comparable positions. All service credited to
each employee by the Company or its affiliates through the Effective Time shall
be recognized by Parent and its affiliates for all purposes, including for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting and benefit accruals under
any employee benefit plan provided by Parent or its affiliates for the benefit
of the employees (other than with respect to benefit accruals under defined
benefit plans or to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits).
Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent permitted by the applicable plan
or plans, Parent shall not treat (and shall cause its affiliates not to treat)
any such employee as a "new" employee for purposes of any pre-existing
condition exclusions, waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements or
similar provision under any health or other welfare plan, and will take
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate arrangements with its
insurance carrier(s), to the extent applicable to ensure such result, and
Parent shall provide (or shall cause its affiliates to provide) each such
employee with credit for any copayments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any welfare benefit plans in which such employees are
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, as if those deductibles or
copayments had been paid under the welfare benefit plans (if different) in
which such employees are eligible to participate at and after the Effective
Time.

                  (b) The Surviving Corporation hereby agrees to honor
(promptly and without modification) and assume the Company's obligations under
employment agreements, employment termination agreements and individual benefit
arrangements set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, all as in effect at
the Effective Time. Parent hereby guarantees the payment and performance by the
Surviving Corporation of such obligations pursuant to this Section 6.7(b).

         6.9 Certain Actions and Proceedings. Until this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Article VIII, the parties hereto shall cooperate
and consult with the other parties in the defense of any action, suit or

terminated, and the Merger may be abandoned, by Parent or the Company if (i)
the Merger shall not have been consummated by September 30, 2006 (the

been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to be
consummated on or before such date, (ii) any Governmental Entity shall have

otherwise prohibiting the material transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and

its stockholders as required by Law; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.2(iii) shall not be available to
any party whose willful breach of a representation, warranty or covenant in
this Agreement has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure to
obtain such approval.

         8.3 Termination by Parent. This Agreement may be terminated by Parent,
if (i) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform or comply with any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations set forth in this

the Company, (i) if Parent or Newco shall have breached or failed to perform or

set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform or comply (A)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.1 or 7.3
and (B) is not cured, or is incapable of being cured, by Parent or Newco within
30 calendar days following receipt or written notice of such breach or failure
to perform from Company or (ii) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall

2006, is made by and between Packaging Investors, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (the "Stockholder") and Thilmany, L.L.C., a Delaware limited
liability company ("Parent"). Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger
Agreement (as defined below).

         WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, Parent, KTHP Acquisition, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Newco"), and
Packaging Dynamics Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), are
entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"),
providing for the merger of Newco with and into the Company with the Company as
the surviving corporation (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement;

         WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Stockholder beneficially owns and
has the power to vote and dispose of 3,985,561 shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Owned Shares" and, together with
any securities issued or exchanged with respect to such shares upon any

         WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Parent and Newco to
enter into the Merger Agreement, each of Parent and Newco has required that the
Stockholder agree, and in order to induce Parent and Newco to enter into the

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

                                  ARTICLE I.
                                VOTING AGREEMENT
                                ----------------

         Section 1.1 Voting Agreement. The Stockholder hereby agrees that
during the Voting Period (as defined below), at any meeting of the stockholders
of the Company, however called, or at any adjournment thereof or in any other
circumstances upon which a vote, consent or other approval (including by

assets or securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (other than
pursuant to the Merger) or any other Acquisition Proposal. For the purposes of
this Agreement, "Voting Period" shall mean the period commencing on the date
hereof and ending immediately prior to any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof.

         Section 1.2 Proxy.

         (a) THE STOCKHOLDER HEREBY GRANTS TO, AND APPOINTS, PARENT, THE
PRESIDENT OF PARENT AND THE SECRETARY OF PARENT, IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CAPACITIES
AS OFFICERS OF PARENT, AND ANY OTHER DESIGNEE OF PARENT, EACH OF THEM
INDIVIDUALLY, THE STOCKHOLDER'S IRREVOCABLE (UNTIL THE TERMINATION DATE (AS
DEFINED BELOW)) PROXY AND ATTORNEY-IN-FACT (WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION) TO
VOTE THE COVERED SHARES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 1.1. THE STOCKHOLDER INTENDS
THIS PROXY TO BE IRREVOCABLE (UNTIL THE TERMINATION DATE) AND COUPLED WITH AN
INTEREST AND WILL TAKE SUCH FURTHER ACTION OR EXECUTE SUCH OTHER INSTRUMENTS AS
MAY BE NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE THE INTENT OF THIS PROXY AND HEREBY REVOKES ANY
PROXY PREVIOUSLY GRANTED BY THE STOCKHOLDER WITH RESPECT TO THE COVERED SHARES.

         (b) Except with respect to breaches of representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements expressly set forth in this Agreement, the parties
acknowledge and agree that neither Parent, nor Parent's successors, assigns,
subsidiaries, divisions, employees, officers, directors, shareholders, agents
and affiliates, shall owe any duty to, whether in law or otherwise, or incur
any liability of any kind whatsoever, including without limitation, with
respect to any and all claims, losses, demands, causes of action, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) and compensation of any kind or
nature whatsoever to the Stockholder in connection with, as a result of or
otherwise relating to any vote (or refrain from voting) by Parent of the
Covered Shares subject to the irrevocable proxy hereby granted to Parent at any

execution hereof any trust or estate should be terminated, or if any
corporation or partnership should be dissolved or liquidated, or if any other
such event or events shall occur before the Termination Date, certificates
representing the Covered Shares shall be delivered by or on behalf of the
Stockholder in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
and this Agreement, and actions taken by the Parent hereunder shall be as valid
as if such termination, dissolution, liquidation or other event or events had
not occurred, regardless of whether or not the Parent has received notice of
such termination, dissolution, liquidation or other event.

         Section 1.3 Other Matters. Except as set forth in Section 1.1, the
Stockholder shall not be restricted from voting in favor of, against or
abstaining with respect to any matter presented to the stockholders of the
Company. In addition, nothing in this Agreement shall give Parent or any of its
officers or designees the right to vote any Covered Shares in connection with
the election of directors.

decree applicable to the Parent or (ii) result in any breach of or constitute a

approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications,
would not materially impair the ability of the Parent to perform its
obligations hereunder.

and binding obligation of the Stockholder, enforceable against the Stockholder

         Section 5.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

         Section 5.8 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement and the
Merger Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto,
or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This
Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of
law or otherwise), except that Parent or Newco may assign all or any of their
rights and obligations hereunder to an affiliate, provided, however, that no
such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder
if such assignee does not perform such obligations.

         Section 5.9 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at
any time prior to the Effective Time. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

         Section 5.10 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or
other act of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement
of the other party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any
party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

         Section 5.11 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement.

         Section 5.12 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York (without giving
effect to the choice of law principles therein).

         Section 5.13 Specific Performance; Submission to Jurisdiction. The
parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of the
State of New York or, if such court does not have jurisdiction over the subject
matter of such proceeding or if such jurisdiction is not available, in the
state courts located within New York, New York, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. In addition,
each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
the State of New York and the state courts located within New York, New York in
the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court, (iii) agrees
that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the United
States District Court for the Southern District of the State of New York or the
state courts located within New York, New York and (iv) to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, consents to service being made through the notice procedures
set forth in Section 5.6. Each party hereto hereby agrees that, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by
U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in Section 5.6 shall
be effective service of process for any suit or proceeding in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 5.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have
to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each of the parties
hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of the other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not,
in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other party hereto have been induced to enter into
this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this Section 5.14.

         Section 5.15 Headings. The descriptive headings contained in this
Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

         Section 5.16 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts,
and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

         Section 5.17 Further Assurances. From time to time, at the request of
the other party and without further consideration, each party hereto shall take
such reasonable further action as may reasonably be necessary or desirable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
