 (vi) If any such proposed change remains disputed after a period of 30 days following the date on which the Seller Representative gives Buyer the written notice of objection, then Buyer shall engage KPMG LLP, or, if KPMG LLP has a conflict of interest with respect to such engagement that is not waived by the parties or is otherwise unable or unwilling to accept such engagement, another nationally recognized "Big Four" independent registered public accounting firm having substantial insurance and reinsurance arbitration expertise that (A) does not have a conflict of interest with respect to such engagement that is not waived by the parties and (B) is mutually acceptable to Buyer and the Seller Representative (KPMG LLP or such other firm, the " _Independent Accountant_ ") to resolve any remaining disputes or, if such dispute involves a matter contemplated by _Section 6.17(c)_, the parties shall engage the Independent Actuary to resolve such dispute in accordance with the terms of such _Section 6.17(c)_. When acting under this Agreement, the Independent Accountant and the Independent Actuary shall be entitled to the privileges and immunities of an arbitrator. Each of the Independent Accountant and the Independent Actuary will act as an arbitrator to determine only those issues as to which the Seller Representative has disagreed in the notice of objection duly delivered pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(iv)_ that are disputed by Buyer. Buyer and the Seller 

   ##### 

  

   

Representative shall deliver written briefs in support of their positions to
the Independent Accountant or the Independent Actuary, as applicable, and to
one another within 20 Business Days after the matter is submitted to the
Independent Accountant or Independent Actuary, as applicable. Reasonable
discovery will be permitted in any such arbitration proceeding, including the
right to depose or obtain interrogatories from officers, employees or other
representatives of the other party to the extent such Persons are
knowledgeable about, or possess information regarding, matters relevant to
any disputed item. In addition, during the review by the Independent
Accountant or the Independent Actuary, as applicable, Buyer and Sellers shall
each make available to the Independent Accountant or Independent Actuary, as
applicable, such individuals and such information, books, records and work
papers, as may be required by the Independent Accountant or Independent
Actuary to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.3(b)(vi)_;
_provided_ , however, that the independent accountants and independent
actuaries of Sellers, the Seller Representative or Buyer shall not be
obligated to make any working papers available to the Independent Accountant
or Independent Actuary unless and until the Independent Accountant
or Independent Actuary, as applicable, has signed a confidentiality and hold
harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants or
independent actuaries. Buyer and the Seller Representative shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accountant and
the Independent Actuary, as applicable, to issue its written determination
regarding all disputed items within 30 days (and in any event such
determination will be issued not later than 60 days) after such items are
submitted for review. In no event may the Independent Accountants or
Independent Actuarys determination of disputed items be for an amount
that is outside the range of Buyers and Sellers disagreement. The
determination of the Independent Accountant or, with respect to the matters
contemplated by _Section 6.17(c)_ , the Independent Actuary will be final,
binding and conclusive on Buyer and Sellers, and Buyer shall revise the
Proposed Final Balance Sheets to reflect such determination. The fees, costs
and expenses of the Independent Accountant and the Independent Actuary will
be borne by Buyer and Sellers in a proportion equal to the aggregate amount
unsuccessfully disputed by such party over the total amount in dispute
and submitted to the Independent Accountant or Independent Actuary, as
applicable, as calculated by the Independent Accountant or Independent
Actuary, as applicable. 

   

 (vii) The Proposed Final Balance Sheets that become final, binding and conclusive on the parties pursuant to any of clauses (ii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of this _Section 2.3(b)_ are respectively referred to herein as the " _Final GAAP Balance Sheet_ ," the " _Final Statutory Balance Sheet_ " and the " _Final Reciprocals Balance Sheet_." Upon the date that the Final Reciprocals Balance Sheet becomes final, binding and conclusive on the parties, the principal amount of each Purchase Note will automatically be adjusted so that the aggregate principal amount of all Purchase Notes will equal (A) the lesser of (1) the amount, if any, by which the Reciprocals Statutory Capital as of the Closing Date reflected on the Final Reciprocals Balance Sheet exceeds the aggregate principal amount of the Surplus Notes as of the Closing Date (including the amount of the security deposit loan related thereto) and (2) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest on the Surplus Notes as of the Closing Date _less_ (B) the aggregate amount of principal paid with respect to the Purchase Notes from the Closing Date to the date the Final Reciprocals 

   ##### 

  

   

Balance Sheet becomes final, binding and conclusive on the parties. If the
principal amount of any Purchase Note is increased or decreased pursuant to
the previous sentence, then Seller Parent shall deliver or cause to be
delivered such Purchase Note to Buyer, and Buyer will cancel such original
Purchase Note and issue a new Purchase Note having terms identical to such
original Purchase Note but reflecting the adjustment to the
aggregate principal amount thereof as set forth in this _Section 2.3_.
Within five Business Days following the date on which all of the Proposed
Final Balance Sheets are finalized in accordance with any of clauses (ii),
(iv), (v) and (vi) of this _Section 2.3(b)_: 

   

 (A) if the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, Sellers shall pay to Buyer by Wire Transfer an amount equal to such shortfall; and 

   

 (B) if the Final Purchase Price is more than the Estimated Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay to Sellers by Wire Transfer, in the proportions consistent with those described in  _Section 3.2(a)_, an amount equal to such excess. 

   

 (viii) Any payment required to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_ will be made by Wire Transfer together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the rate of interest per annum equal to the prime rate in effect on the Closing Date as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ and will be treated as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for Tax reporting purposes. 

   

 (ix) Buyers and Sellers rights to indemnification pursuant to _Article IX_ will not be deemed to limit, supersede or otherwise affect, or be limited, superseded or otherwise affected by, Buyers and Sellers respective rights under this _Section 2.3(b)_ , except to the extent any Loss is reflected, reserved for or accrued on the Final GAAP Balance Sheet or the Final Statutory Balance Sheet. 

  

 (c) Sellers and Buyer shall allocate the aggregate purchase price payable under this Agreement (the " _Allocable Amount_ ") in accordance with the requirements of Section 1060 of the Code for all Tax purposes. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare a schedule reflecting the allocation of the Allocable Amount and shall submit it to Sellers. Buyer and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the amount and proper allocation of the Allocable Amount in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code; however, if Buyer and Sellers cannot agree on such an allocation, each of Buyer and Sellers shall be free to allocate the Allocable Amount in the manner that such party reasonably believes is most consistent with the requirements of Section 1060 of the Code. No election shall be made by Buyer or Sellers pursuant to Section 338(g) or (h)(10) of the Code with respect to the Shares. 

   

 Section 2.4. _Renewal Rights_. 

   

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at any time following the Closing Date, Buyer shall be entitled to and may, in connection with the first expiration, renewal, or anniversary date of each In-Force Policy (and, with respect to In-Force Policies with renewal rate quotes outstanding on the Closing Date or that are otherwise renewed by a Renewal Rights Seller after the Closing Date, the next expiration, renewal or 

      ##### 

  

    

anniversary date of each In-Force Policy), solicit, quote, bind, write and/or
issue, or cause to be solicited, quoted, bound, written and/or issued to any
policyholder prior to or upon the expiration, cancellation or non-renewal of
such In-Force Policy, policies or other evidences of insurance coverage on
the policy forms of the applicable Permitted Designee, subject in each
case to Applicable Law and the rights of policyholders. 

   

 (b) Effective from and after the Closing Date, the Renewal Rights Sellers shall (i) cease renewing the In-Force Policies and (ii) not write or renew any Insurance Policy in connection with the Business that would have been a Subject Policy if in force on the Closing Date, except (A) pursuant to a renewal offer required under Applicable Law, (B) to honor a quote outstanding on the Closing Date or (C) Accommodation Policies, in each case written by a Tower Reinsurer in accordance with the terms of the Acquired Business Administrative Services Agreements. 

   

 (c) Sellers shall provide to Buyer at the Closing a complete and correct list of all of the In-Force Policies as of the last day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the Closing occurs and all In-Force Policies that have been written on or before such date but with policy inception dates thereafter, along with details identifying such In-Force Policies in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer (including a listing of the producer, the named insured, the policy number, the effective date, the type of policy and the premium). 

   

 (d) With respect to each In-Force Policy, Buyer may, in connection with the first policy anniversary date occurring after the Closing Date, in compliance with all Applicable Laws and in accordance with the terms of Acquired Business Administrative Services Agreements, cause the appropriate Renewal Rights Seller to send to each Policyholder of an In-Force Policy that is selected by Buyer a written notice in the form agreed by the parties notifying such Policyholder of the non-renewal of such In-Force Policy by the applicable Renewal Rights Seller. The Renewal Rights Sellers shall send a copy of such non-renewal notice to the insurance agent appointed by such Policyholder and, as directed by Buyer, shall send a notice to such agent in a form mutually agreeable to the parties informing such agent of the availability of replacement insurance from a Permitted Designee and encouraging such agent to place such insurance with a Permitted Designee. Buyer shall also, in connection with the first policy anniversary date occurring after the Closing Date, in compliance with all Applicable Law and in accordance with the terms of the Acquired Business Administrative Services Agreements, cause the appropriate Renewal Rights Seller to send to each Policyholder of an In-Force Policy that was not selected by Buyer pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 2.4(d)_ a written notice in the form agreed by the parties notifying such Policyholder of the non-renewal of such In-Force Policy by the Renewal Rights Seller. In the event that any notice of non-renewal with respect to an In-Force Policy cannot be sent due to requirements of Applicable Law and such In-Force Policy is renewed by a Renewal Rights Seller pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_, such renewal Insurance Policy will be reinsured pursuant to the Acquired Business Reinsurance Agreements, administered pursuant to the Acquired Business Administrative Services Agreements and subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.4_ with respect to the first policy anniversary after the date of issuance of such Insurance Policy. The applicable Renewal Rights Sellers shall otherwise cooperate with Buyer as reasonably requested by Buyer to facilitate Buyers exercise of its Renewal Rights hereunder. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (e) It is acknowledged and agreed that neither Buyer, any Permitted Designee nor any other Affiliate of Buyer is required to offer insurance coverage to all Policyholders of In-Force Policies, any particular Policyholder of an In-Force Policy or any minimum percentage of Policyholders of In-Force Policies. Buyer and the Permitted Designees will apply their own underwriting judgment and premium rates to the replacement of In-Force Policies as they determine are appropriate in their sole discretion. 

   

 (f) From and after the Closing Date, in accordance with Applicable Law and the terms of the relevant agency agreements, the Renewal Rights Sellers shall modify the agency contracts to terminate and cause their Affiliates (other than the Companies) to modify the agency contracts to terminate their agency appointments, with respect only to insurance products constituting a part of the Business, with the agents that have placed In-Force Policies, and to assist Buyer in contracting directly with such agents as Buyer may select. 

   

 Section 2.5. _Accommodation Policies_. Commencing on the Closing Date and through the 15-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Tower Reinsurer will have the right to issue, on behalf of the Renewal Rights Sellers, Accommodation Policies in accordance with the terms of the applicable Acquired Business Administrative Services Agreement.

under Applicable Law. Since the Evaluation Date, there have been no
significant changes in Seller Parents or the Companies internal control
over financial reporting or, to the Knowledge of Seller Parent, in other
factors that could significantly affect Seller Parents or the Companies
internal control over financial reporting. 

   

 (b) Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.27(b)_, neither any of the Companies nor any director, officer, manager, member or employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the Companies, Sellers or any of their Affiliates has received or been under a duty to report (including any self-reporting obligation) to any Governmental Authority or the board of directors of Seller Parent or the audit committee thereof any non-frivolous material written complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, regarding the accounting, reserving or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Companies or their respective internal control over financial reporting, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that any of the Companies has engaged in questionable accounting, reserving or auditing practices.

Prior to the Closing, Seller Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts and shall cause its Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts, with reasonable cooperation from Buyer, to separate sufficiently all personal, private or financial information about individual customers or consumers related to the Acquired Companies and the Associated Assets from any other information of Sellers or their Affiliates, whether by physical or logical separation of such data and information or by the use of contract, administrative, technical or physical oversights, mechanisms and processes, such that the Acquired Companies will comply with all Applicable Laws with respect to the privacy of such data and information. The cost of such separation will be borne by Seller Parent. 

   

 Section 6.23. _Certain Intellectual Property Transfers_.

Except for the rights expressly granted to Buyer in the Transition Services Agreement with respect to the services provided thereunder, no right, title or interest in or to any Owned Intellectual Property (other than Transferred Owned Intellectual Property) or Licensed Intellectual Property will be granted, transferred or assigned to Buyer in connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. 

   

 Section 6.24. _Cooperation_. Each of the parties hereto shall execute such documents and other papers and perform such further acts as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions hereof and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each such party shall, on or prior to the Closing Date, use its commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill or obtain the fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereto shall cooperate fully with the other in all reasonable respects and shall 

      ##### 

  

    

use commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the objectives of this
Agreement, including making available to each of their respective officers
and employees for interviews and meetings with agents and Governmental
Authorities and furnishing any additional assistance, information
and documents as may be reasonably requested by a party from time to time.
The parties acknowledge that it is in their mutual best interests to refrain
from making derogatory statements about each other and pledge to cooperate
with each other to describe the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
using terms that are as positive as may be permitted. 

   

 Section 6.25. _Actions with respect to York_. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause York to be fully, finally and unconditionally released from all of its obligations under the Commercial Lines Agreement and any agreement or arrangement entered into in connection therewith or ancillary thereto, as of or prior to the Closing. 

   

 Section 6.26. _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, each Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, releases and forever discharges each Company from any and all Losses, which such Seller or its Affiliates now has, has ever had or may hereafter have, against any Company arising from acts, omissions, events or circumstances occurring on or prior to the Closing, including for contribution or indemnification; _provided_ , that nothing contained herein will release any obligation of any Company under this Agreement or under any Ancillary Agreement.

 Section 6.29. _Records License_. Buyer acknowledges that, in the conduct of performing Services under (and as defined in) the Transition Services Agreement, Sellers and their Affiliates may from time to time be required to access and use information and data relating to the Business included in the Records.

Effective as of the Closing, Buyer hereby grants to Sellers and their Affiliates a non-exclusive, revocable, fully paid-up, worldwide right and license to use the Records and all information and 

      ##### 

  

    

data contained therein as and solely to the extent required to perform the
Services in accordance with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement.

TAX MATTERS 

  

 Section 7.1. _Tax Indemnity_. 

   

 (a) From and after the Closing Date, Sellers shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold Buyer and all of Buyers Affiliates, which for purposes of this _Article VII_, shall include the Companies (the " _Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties_ "), harmless against all Losses relating to, arising out of, or resulting from (i) any liability for Taxes of or relating to the Excluded Policies; (ii) any liability for Taxes and related Losses imposed on or with respect to the Companies, the Associated Assets, the Subject Policies or the Accommodation Policies for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, and for the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "); (iii) any Taxes resulting from or attributable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that are undertaken at the direction of or for the benefit of any Seller; (iv) Taxes for which Sellers are responsible pursuant to _Section 7.5_; (v) Taxes of a Person other than one of the Companies for which such Company may be liable under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any similar provision of state, local, or non-United States Tax law) as a result of being a member of any group which files or has filed a Tax Return on a consolidated, combined, or unitary basis for a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date; and (vi) a breach or inaccuracy of warranty or representation under _Section 4.9(a)(ii)(I)_ or _4.24_ or the breach or nonperformance of any covenants or agreements relating to Tax matters set forth in this Agreement (determined without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualification); and (vii) all reasonable costs and expenses relating to the review, investigation, remediation, settlement, contest, adjudication and analysis of any matter relating to the Taxes and Losses described in clauses (i)  (vi) (clauses (i)  (vii) hereinafter referred to as the " _Tax Losses_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers liability for Tax Losses shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of any specific accrual expressly set forth on the Final GAAP Balance Sheet for such liability to the extent such accrual reduced the Final Purchase Price, and Sellers and Buyer agree that this proviso shall be interpreted in a manner that will not provide Sellers with any duplicated benefit relating to such accruals. 

   

 (b) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold each Seller harmless against all Losses relating to, arising out of, or resulting from any liability for Taxes and related Losses imposed on or with respect to the Companies, the Associated Assets, the Subject Policies or the Accommodation Policies for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date, and for the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date (a " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ "). 

   

 (c) For purposes of _Sections 7.1(a)_ and _7.1(b)_ , in the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that begins before the Closing Date and ends after the 

      ##### 

  

    

Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any such Tax that is
allocable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall be: 

    

 (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year ended with (and included) the Closing Date; 

   

 (ii) in the case of Taxes that are based upon gross premiums deemed equal to the amount that would be payable with respect to the premium written as of the Closing Date; and 

   

 (iii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the assets of any of the Companies, or otherwise measured by the level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period and the remainder of such Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period shall be allocable to the portion of the period beginning after the Closing Date. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Sellers shall not be liable for (and Buyer shall pay, indemnify Sellers and their Affiliates against, and hold Sellers and their Affiliates harmless from) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Companies or the Associated Assets resulting from any transaction or event that is outside the ordinary course of business and occurs after the Closing but on the Closing Date. 

   

 Section 7.2. _Tax Returns and Payments_. 

   

 (a) Sellers and any applicable Affiliates thereof will, in accordance with Applicable Law, duly and timely prepare and file all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and all Tax Returns filed on a combined, consolidated, group, or unified basis that include Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers other than the Companies and Buyer shall duly and timely prepare and file all other Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Companies. All Tax Returns with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be prepared, completed, and filed in a manner consistent with past practices regarding such Tax Returns concerning the income, properties, or operations of the Companies (including elections and accounting methods and conventions), except as otherwise required by law or regulation or otherwise agreed to by Buyer and Sellers prior to the filing thereof. All Tax Returns with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period shall correctly and accurately set forth the amount of any Taxes relating to the applicable period and the party preparing and filing such Tax Returns shall pay within the time and manner prescribed by law all Taxes due and payable with respect to such Tax Returns. Sellers or Buyer (as the case may be) shall pay the other for any Taxes for which a Seller or Buyer, respectively, is liable pursuant to  _Section 7.1_ but which are payable with any Tax Return to be filed by the 

      ##### 

  

    

other pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ upon the written request of the party
entitled to payment, setting forth in detail the computation of the amount
owed by Sellers or Buyer (as the case may be), at least 10 Business Days
prior to the due date for paying such Taxes. 

   

 (b) A nationally recognized "Big Four" independent registered public accounting firm other than PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that (x) does not have a conflict of interest with respect to such engagement that is not waived by the parties and (y) is mutually acceptable to Buyer and the Seller Representative (such firm, the " _Accounting Firm_ ") will conduct a complete review of the Surplus Notes to ascertain (i) whether there is substantial authority for the tax treatment previously claimed by the applicable Reciprocal with respect to any payments made or accrued with respect to such Surplus Notes (the " _Claimed Treatment_ ") and, if the Accounting Firm concludes that there is not substantial authority for the Claimed Treatment, (ii) the proper tax treatment of any payments made or accrued with respect to such Surplus Notes (the " _Proper Treatment_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree that, if the Accounting Firm concludes that there is not substantial authority for the Claimed Treatment, the parties will file all Tax Returns consistent with the Proper Treatment and, as allowed by Applicable Law, will amend any prior Tax Returns to the extent necessary to reflect such Proper Treatment. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers will be responsible for any interest, fees, penalties and other Liabilities resulting from any amendment to a prior Tax Return required by this  _Section 7.2(b)_. Buyer, on one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall share equally in the costs of engaging the Accounting Firm to conduct its review pursuant to this _Section 7.2(b)_. 

   

 Section 7.3. _Tax Controversy_. 

   

 (a) The Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties will promptly notify Sellers in writing (a " _Tax Claim Notice_ ") upon the discovery of any matter that may give rise to a claim for indemnity against a Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ for which the Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties intend to seek indemnity pursuant to this _Article VII_ (a " _Tax Claim_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to comply with this clause shall affect Sellers indemnification obligation hereunder only to the extent that Sellers ability to control such Tax Claim is adversely and materially affected by such failure. A Tax Claim Notice shall contain a summary of the facts (set forth with reasonable specificity) underlying or relating to the relevant claim, any correspondence or notice received from any third party with respect thereto, a statement that the Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties seek indemnification for Taxes relating to such claim, and the basis thereof. 

   

 (b) Upon providing written notice to Buyer within 15 days of receiving a Tax Claim Notice that acknowledges liability for all Taxes and Losses relating to the relevant Tax Claim, Sellers, at their expense, shall have the right to control the conduct of the defense of any Tax Claim that involves solely a matter for which Sellers shall be liable and against which Sellers are required to indemnify the Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties; _provided_ _that_ Buyer (at its expense) shall have the right to participate in the conduct of the defense of any Tax Claim controlled by Sellers. With respect to issues relating to a potential adjustment for which both Sellers (as evidenced by their acknowledgment under this paragraph) and the Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties could be liable, (i) each party may participate in the audit or proceeding and (ii) the audit or proceeding shall be controlled by that party which would bear the burden of the greater portion of the sum of the adjustment and any corresponding adjustments that may 

      ##### 

  

    

reasonably be anticipated for future Tax periods. The principle set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence shall govern also for purposes of deciding
any issue that must be decided jointly (including, without limitation, choice
of judicial forum) in situations in which separate issues are otherwise
controlled under this paragraph by Sellers and Buyer. Neither Buyer
nor Sellers shall enter into any compromise or agree to settle any claim
pursuant to any Tax audit or proceeding that would adversely affect the other
party for such year or a subsequent year without the written consent of the
other party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer (at its
expense) shall control the conduct of all other Tax Claims. The Buyer Tax
Indemnified Parties and Sellers agree to cooperate in the defense against or
compromise of any claim in any audit or proceeding. 

   

 Section 7.4. _Tax Cooperation_. 

   

 (a) The parties will provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request with respect to any Tax matter, at the expense of the requesting party. Such cooperation and information shall include providing signatures with respect to any Tax Returns that must be filed and providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers, and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities provided that Sellers shall not be required to disclose to Buyer any consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Return which includes Sellers or any of their Affiliates or any Tax-related work papers, except, in each case, for materials or portions thereof that relate solely to the Companies. Each Seller shall make itself available to provide explanations of any documents or information provided hereunder. Each Seller, Buyer, and the Affiliates thereof shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records, and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Companies for each taxable period first ending after the Closing Date and for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions, or (ii) six years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. Prior to disposing of any such records, notice shall be given to the other party providing reasonable terms allowing such other party to take, at its sole expense, possession of such records. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties shall not, except as required by Applicable Law, amend any Tax Returns relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without Sellers written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall have no obligation (but shall have the right at Buyers sole discretion) to carry back any Tax attributes of the Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties to taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , _that_ , except as required by Applicable Law, Buyer shall not carry back any Tax attributes without Sellers written consent if such carryback could adversely affect Sellers. Any Tax refund (or equivalent benefit to Sellers through a reduction in Tax liability) arising out of such carryback shall be the property of Buyer and, if received by Sellers, shall be paid over promptly to Buyer. Any other Tax refund (including any interest with respect thereto) relating to the Companies for any taxable period prior to the Closing Date (except for any refund included on the Final GAAP Balance Sheet, which shall be the property of Buyer, and if paid to Sellers, shall be paid over promptly to Buyer) shall be the property of Sellers, and if received by any Buyer Tax Indemnified Party shall be paid over promptly to Sellers. 

       ##### 

  

     

 Section 7.5. _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, all stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp, registration, filing, sales, use, recording, ad valorem, and other similar Taxes arising out of, or directly attributable to, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne by Sellers regardless of whether any such Transfer taxes are levied on Sellers or Buyer. Any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed when due by Sellers. In the event that any such Transfer Taxes are required under applicable law to be collected, remitted or paid by Buyer, or any of its Affiliates, Sellers, or their Affiliates, shall pay the amount of such Transfer Taxes to Buyer or its Affiliate, as applicable, at the Closing or thereafter, as applicable, as requested of or by Buyer or its Affiliate. 

   

 Section 7.6. _Miscellaneous_. 

   

 (a) Sellers and Buyer agree to treat all payments made by either of them under this Agreement as adjustments to the purchase price hereunder for Tax purposes and agree that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except to the extent that the laws of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise. 

   

 (b) At Buyers request, all tax-sharing agreements or arrangements among and between the Companies shall be terminated immediately prior to the Closing Date and shall have no continuing force or effect. Sellers and the Companies shall, unless otherwise directed by Buyer, terminate any power of attorney granted by or on behalf of any of the Companies, and any such terminated power of attorney shall have no continuing force or effect after the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, all covenants, agreements, and indemnification matters contained in this _Article VII_ and all representations and warranties of Sellers contained in _Section 4.24_ shall terminate 60 days after the expiration of all relevant statute of limitations (including all periods of extension, whether automatic or permissive) relating to such Taxes. The waiver by any party of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant, obligation, or agreement set forth in this Agreement, shall not affect such partys right to indemnification or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, and agreements. Notice with respect to any claim in respect of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty shall be in writing given to Sellers. Any representation or warranty shall survive the time it would otherwise terminate pursuant to this _Section 7.6(c)_ to the extent that the Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties shall have delivered to Sellers written notice setting forth with reasonable specificity the basis of such claim prior to the expiration of such time pursuant to this _Section 7.6(c)_ ; _provided_ , that after the delivery of any such notice, the Buyer Tax Indemnified Parties shall expeditiously pursue the resolution of such claim. 

   

 (d) To the extent Treasury Regulations Section 1.502-36 is applicable to Seller Parent or Sellers with respect to the sale of the Companies, the common parent of any Affiliated Group that includes any of the Companies shall make the election provided under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36 (including on a protective basis) to reduce the Tax basis that Sellers have in the shares of the Companies to prevent any reduction of any Tax attributes of 

      ##### 

  

    

the Companies, and such common parent company shall not make any election
permitted under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36 that would result in
the reattribution of the Tax attributes of the Companies to such common
parent company or any other member of any Affiliated Group that includes the
Companies. 

   

 Section 7.7. _Tax Exclusivity_. Anything in _Article IX_ to the contrary notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to indemnification relating to Tax matters (including indemnification for breach of the representations and warranties of  _Sections 4.9(a)(ii)(I)_ and _4.24_ ) shall be governed exclusively by this _Article VII_ and _Section 9.4(h)_.

 (b) Buyer shall have performed or complied in all material respects with all covenants and agreements required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by Buyer on or prior to the Closing Date;

 Section 8.3. _Frustration of Closing Conditions_.

ARTICLE IX 

   

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION 

  

 Section 9.1. _Survival_. The representations and warranties of Seller Parent set forth in _Section 4.25_ (Employee Matters) shall survive until 120 days after the expiration of all the applicable statutes of limitations (including all periods of extension, whether automatic or permissive), and the representations and warranties of the parties set forth in _Sections 4.1_ (Organization and Related Matters) (in each case limited to only the first and second sentence of each subsection), _4.2(a)_ (Authority; No Violation), _4.4(a)_ , _(b)_  and _(c)_ (Securities Ownership), _4.5_ (Subsidiaries), _4.20_ (Title to Assets),  _4.33_ (No Broker), _5.1_ (Organization and Related Matters), _5.2_ (Authority; No Violation), _5.5_ (Investment Intent of Buyer), _5.6_ (Investment Company), and  _5.7_ (No Broker) shall survive the Closing without limitation as to time.

The waiver by any party of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant, obligation or agreement set forth in this Agreement, shall not affect such partys right to indemnification or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations and agreements. 

      ##### 

  

    

Notice with respect to any claim in respect of any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be in writing and
shall be given to the party against which such claim is asserted. Any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive the time it
would otherwise terminate pursuant to this _Section 9.1_ to the extent that
the party claiming indemnification for a breach thereof has delivered to the
other party written notice setting forth with reasonable specificity the
basis of such claim prior to the expiration of such time pursuant to this
_Section 9.1_. 

   

 Section 9.2. _Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) Subject to _Sections 9.1_, _9.2(b)-(_ d _)_ and _9.4_ , Seller Parent shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies), and their respective successors and assigns (each, a " _Buyer Indemnitee_ "), against, hold each Buyer Indemnitee harmless from and pay to any Buyer Indemnitee as and when incurred, any Losses arising out of or relating to (i) any breach by Seller Parent of any of its representations or warranties contained herein; (ii) any breach by Sellers of any of their covenants or agreements contained herein; (iii) the Excluded Liabilities and (iv) the Excluded Policies. 

   

 (b) Subject to _Section 9.4_, Seller Parent shall not be required to indemnify, hold harmless or pay any Buyer Indemnitee for Losses under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_, (i) with respect to any claim (or series of related claims arising from the same underlying facts, events or circumstances) unless such claim (or series of related claims arising from the same underlying facts, events or circumstances) involves Losses in excess of $10,000 (nor shall any such claim or series of related claims that does not meet the $10,000 threshold be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Losses for which Seller Parent has responsibility under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_); (ii) unless the cumulative aggregate amount of all such Losses for which Seller Parent would, but for this _Section 9.2(b)_, be liable exceeds an amount equal to 0.75% of the Final Purchase Price (the " _Indemnification Basket_ "), and then Seller Parent will only be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee for Losses under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ for the amount of such excess; and (iii) in a cumulative aggregate amount in excess of 25% of the Final Purchase Price (the " _Indemnification Cap_ "). Finally, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller Parent shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Buyer Indemnitee against, or reimburse any Buyer Indemnitee and shall not have any liability for, any Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ in a cumulative aggregate amount exceeding the Final Purchase Price. 

   

 (c) The limitations set forth in _Section 9.2(b)_ will not apply to Losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of (i) a breach of the representations and warranties in  _Sections_ _4.1_ , _4.2(a)_ , _4.4(a), (b) and (c),_ and _4.33_ hereof (except that the limitations set forth in the last sentence of _Section 9.2(b)_ will apply to such Losses notwithstanding the foregoing), (ii) the Excluded Liabilities, (iii) the Excluded Policies and (iv) the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to indemnification relating to Tax matters (including indemnification for breach of the representations and warranties of _Section 4.24_) governed by _Article VII_. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller Parent will not be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee for any Losses arising out of or relating to a breach of the representations and warranties in this Agreement if and to the extent that such 

      ##### 

  

    

Losses are reflected, reserved for or accrued on the Final GAAP Balance Sheet
or the Final Statutory Balance Sheet. 

   

 (e) Subject to _Sections 9.1_ and _9.4_ , Buyer shall indemnify Sellers and their directors, officers, employees and Affiliates, and their respective successors and assigns (each, a " _Seller Indemnitee_ "), against, hold each Seller Indemnitee harmless from and pay to each Seller Indemnitee as and when incurred, any Losses arising out of or relating to (i) any breach by Buyer of any of its representations or warranties contained herein and (ii) any breach by Buyer of any of its covenants or agreements contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to indemnify any Seller Indemnitee for Losses under _Section 9.2(e)(i)_ of this Agreement unless the cumulative aggregate amount of all Losses for which Buyer would, but for this proviso, be liable under _Section 9.2(e)(i)_, does not exceed the Indemnification Basket on a cumulative basis, and then Buyer will only be required to indemnify any Seller Indemnitee for Losses under _Section 9.2(e)(i)_ of this Agreement for the amount of such excess; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer shall not be liable in the aggregate under _Section 9.2(e)(i)_ for any Losses in excess of the Indemnification Cap (other than Losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of a breach of the representations and warranties in _Sections 5.1_, _5.2_ , _5.5_ , _5.6_ and _5.7_ ). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Seller Indemnitee against, or reimburse any Seller Indemnitee and shall not have any liability for, any Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2(e)(i)_ in a cumulative aggregate amount exceeding the Final Purchase Price. 

   

 Section 9.3. _Indemnification Procedures_. 

   

 (a) Upon any Person entitled to be indemnified under this _Article IX_ (the " _Indemnified Person_ ") becoming aware of a fact, condition or event for which indemnification is provided under this _Article IX_, the Indemnified Person will with reasonable promptness notify the Person from whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Person_ ") in writing of such fact, condition or event; _provided_ , that the failure to provide such notice will not limit the Indemnified Persons right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person is actually materially prejudiced thereby. If such fact, condition or event is the assertion of a claim by a third party, the Indemnifying Person will be entitled to assume the defense of such claim. Notwithstanding the Indemnifying Persons election to assume the defense or investigation of such claim, the Indemnified Person will have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense or investigation of such claim, action or proceeding at its own expense. An Indemnifying Person who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Persons with respect to such claim. 

   

 (b) No Indemnifying Person may settle any claim that would give rise to liability on the part of the Indemnifying Person under this _Article IX_ without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ that an Indemnified Person shall not be required to consent to any settlement involving the imposition of equitable remedies or involving the imposition of any material obligations on such Indemnified Person other than financial obligations for which such Indemnified Person will be indemnified hereunder. No Indemnifying Person shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the 

      ##### 

  

    

claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Person of a release from all
liability in respect to such claim or litigation. Whenever the Indemnified
Person or the Indemnifying Person receives a firm offer to settle a claim for
which indemnification is sought under this _Article IX_, it shall promptly
notify the other of such offer. 

   

 Section 9.4. _Certain Limitations_. 

   

 (a) For purposes of this _Article IX_, any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty (other than the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections_   _4.6_ and _4.9(c)_ shall be determined without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualification. 

   

 (b) The representations, warranties and covenants of Sellers and Buyer Indemnitees rights to indemnification with respect thereto will not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made or knowledge obtained by or on behalf of such Buyer Indemnitee (including by any of its advisers, consultants or representatives). 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to the contrary, nothing herein or therein will limit in any way any partys remedies in respect of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or omission or intentional misconduct by the other party in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. 

   

 (d) No party to this Agreement (or any of its Affiliates) will, in any event, be liable or otherwise responsible to any other party (or any of its Affiliates) for any punitive damages, other than punitive damages paid or payable to a third party. 

   

 (e) Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that (i) prior to the Closing, other than in the case of intentional breach or fraud by Sellers or their Affiliates, the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or any certificate or instrument delivered hereunder shall be, in the event that each of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ has not been satisfied or waived, refusal to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) following the Closing, other than Losses arising from fraud, (A) the indemnification provisions of this _Article IX_ and, with respect to Taxes for which an indemnity is provided under _Article VII_, _Article VII_ shall be (1) the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties hereto for any breach of the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement and (2) the sole and exclusive monetary remedies of the parties hereto for any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and (B) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of any party hereto to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (f) If any portion of Losses to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party may be covered, in whole or in part, by third party insurance coverage, the Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party (a " _Notice of Insurance_ "). If the Indemnifying Party so requests within sixty (60) days after receipt of a Notice of Insurance, the Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (which shall not include the 

      ##### 

  

    

obligation to institute or defend any action) to collect the maximum amount of
insurance proceeds thereunder, in which event all such proceeds actually
received (net of deductibles, co-payments or other costs incurred the
Indemnified Party (including increased premiums on such related Insurance
Policies) in seeking such collection) shall be considered " _Eligible
Insurance Proceeds_." 

   

 (g) Any amount payable by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be reduced by any Eligible Insurance Proceeds. In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from a third Person any Eligible Insurance Proceeds or any other amount in respect of any Loss for which an Indemnifying Party has actually reimbursed it pursuant to this _Article IX_, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Eligible Insurance Proceeds, but not in excess of the sum of any amount previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim. 

   

 (h) Any indemnity payment made by an Indemnifying Party under this Agreement shall be adjusted to account for any Taxes imposed upon the receipt of such payment and shall be reduced by the amount of any Tax Benefit realized by the Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof arising out of the Loss for which the indemnification payment is being made. For purposes of determining the amount of any Tax Benefit, the recipient of the Tax Benefit shall be deemed to pay Tax at the highest United States federal income tax corporate marginal rate in effect in the year such indemnifiable loss is incurred and shall be deemed to realize or utilize any Tax Benefit in the first taxable year that such Tax Benefit may be realized or utilized under applicable Law after taking into account all other Tax attributes of such indemnified party and the projected utilization of such Tax attributes as computed by the recipient of such Tax Benefit. If a Tax Benefit resulting from an indemnifiable loss is available in multiple Tax years, the amount of such Tax Benefit for purposes of this _Section 9.4(h)_ shall be the net present value of all of such available Tax Benefits, calculated by using a discount rate equal to the long-term applicable federal rate for the month in which such indemnifiable loss is incurred. 

   

 (i) The parties hereto shall treat any indemnification payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price. 

   

 Section 9.5. _Tax Indemnification_. Anything in this _Article IX_ to the contrary notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to indemnification relating to Tax matters (including indemnification for breach of the representations and warranties of  _Sections 4.9(a)(ii)(I)_ and _4.24_ ) will be governed exclusively by _Article VII_ and _Section 9.4(h)_. 

   

ARTICLE X

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) at the election of either Buyer or Sellers, if the Closing Date has not occurred on or before December 31, 2010; _provided_ that no party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(a)(ii)_ if such partys failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur; 

   

 (iii) by either Buyer or Sellers if a court of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_  that no party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(a)(iii)_ if such partys failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or resulted in, the entry of such order, decree or ruling; or 

   

 (iv) (A) by Buyer, if at any time there has been an inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Sellers contained in this Agreement that would cause the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.1_ and such inaccuracy or breach is (1) not capable of being cured prior to the Closing or (2) capable of being cured prior the Closing and is not so cured within 45 days after the Seller Representative shall have received notice of such inaccuracy or breach from Buyer, or (B) by Sellers, if, at any time there has been an inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Buyer contained in this Agreement that would cause the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.2_ and such inaccuracy or breach is (1) not capable of being cured prior to the Closing or (2) capable of being cured prior the Closing and is not so cured within 45 days after Buyer shall have received notice of such inaccuracy or breach from the Seller Representative. 

  

 (b) The termination of this Agreement shall be effectuated by the delivery of a written notice of such termination from the party terminating this Agreement to the other party. 

   

 Section 10.2. _Obligations upon Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1_, all obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement shall terminate and there shall be no liability of any party hereto to any other party except (i) as set forth in _Sections 6.3_, _6.5_ and _10.3(a) and (b)_ and  _Article XI_ and (ii) that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any intentional and material breach of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 10.3. _Termination Fee_. 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding _Section 10.2_, (i) if this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)(iv)(A)_, then Seller Parent shall pay to Buyer, within five Business Days after the date of such termination, as liquidated damages and not as penalty, a termination fee equal to $10,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by Wire Transfer and (ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Sellers pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)(iv)(B)_, then Buyer shall pay, as liquidated damages and not as penalty, the Termination Fee to the Seller Representative on behalf of all Sellers by Wire Transfer within five Business Days after the date of such termination. The payment of the Termination Fee by Buyer will be the exclusive remedy of Sellers for Losses arising as a result of any actions taken as set forth on _Schedule 6.1(B)_. Subject to the preceding 

      ##### 

  

    

sentence, the payment by any party of the Termination Fee shall not be an
exclusive remedy for purposes of this Agreement and shall in no way limit any
rights of the party receiving the Termination Fee from bringing any Claim
with respect to any matter described in _Section 10.2(i)_ or _Section
10.2(ii)_ and receiving an award of any remedy with respect thereto; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the amount of any damages award received by such
party shall be reduced by the amount received by such party in respect of the
Termination Fee (excluding any amount received pursuant to _Section
10.3(b)_). 

   

 (b) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section 10.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other parties would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if either party fails to pay the Termination Fee when due under this _Section 10.3_ and the other party successfully obtains a judgment against such party for the amount of such Termination Fee, such non-breaching party will also be entitled to all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisers, actuaries and accountants) incurred by such party in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such judgment from the date the Termination Fee was first required to be paid under this  _Section 10.3_ to the date of actual payment at a rate per annum equal to rate applicable to the prime rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date the Termination Fee was first required to be paid under this _Section 10.3_ _plus_ 4%, compounded quarterly.

hereof and thereof. 

   

 Section 11.4. _Interpretation_. 

   

 (a) The parties acknowledge and agree that they may pursue judicial remedies at law in the event of a dispute with respect to the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

 (b) The Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement that are specifically referred to herein are a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. When reference is made in this Agreement to any Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference is to a Section, Exhibit or Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. A disclosure by Seller Parent in any Seller Schedule contained herein shall be deemed to be disclosed in any other Seller Schedule as to which it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other Seller Schedule, notwithstanding the absence of a reference or cross-reference thereto. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

 Section 11.5. _Construction_. The parties intend for each representation, warranty, covenant, obligation, agreement and condition contained herein to have independent significance. If any party has breached or violated or not fulfilled, or if there is an inaccuracy in, 

      ##### 

   

    

any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation, agreement or condition
contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation, agreement or condition
relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels
of specificity) that the party has not breached or violated, has fulfilled or
in respect of which there is not an inaccuracy, will not detract from or
mitigate the fact that the party has breached or violated, not fulfilled or
there is an inaccuracy in, the other representation, warranty, covenant,
obligation, agreement or condition. 

   

 Section 11.6. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction.

Each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints, with full power of substitution, the Seller Representative as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority in such Sellers name, to take all actions required or permitted to be taken hereunder or under the Ancillary Agreements, and to otherwise act on behalf of, and to bind, each Seller for all purposes under this Agreement or under the Ancillary Agreements, including with respect to the receipt of proceeds or any other receivables hereunder, administering any indemnification matter on behalf of Sellers, including agreeing to the settlement of any indemnification matter and otherwise handling and negotiating indemnification matters.

Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five (5) Business Days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim. 

  

 (b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed 

      ##### 

  

    

by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or
prosecute any Third Party Claim, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in
the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the
Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have
no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims
effected without its written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); the Indemnifying Party shall not admit any liability
with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party
Claim without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (A) there is no finding
or admission of any violation of Applicable Law or any violation of the
rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be
made against the Indemnified Party, and (B) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and a full
and complete release is provided to the Indemnified Party. 

   

 (c) The provisions of this Article XVIII shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 18.3. _Procedures for Direct Claims_.

Such notice referred to in the preceding sentence shall state the relevant facts and include therewith relevant documents and a statement in reasonable detail as to the basis for the indemnification sought. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the Indemnifying Party in a timely manner shall not be deemed a waiver of the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification with respect to any claim made pursuant to this Section 18.3, other than to the extent that such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party.

 Section 4.1. _Administration_. Pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement, from and after the date hereof, Reinsurer shall administer the Insurance Contracts on behalf of Seller. 

   

 Section 4.2. _Contract Changes_. Except as directed by Reinsurer or as performed by Reinsurer acting on behalf of Seller in Reinsurers capacity as the Administrator under the Administrative Services Agreement, Seller, on its own initiative, shall not change the terms or conditions of any Insurance Contract. If the Insurance Liabilities under any of the Insurance Contracts are changed (A) because of changes made on or after the Effective Date in the terms and conditions of the Insurance Contracts effected by Reinsurer acting pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement or (B) by reason of the requirements of any Governmental Authority or otherwise required by Applicable Law, Reinsurer will share proportionately, on a 100% quota share basis, in such changes, and Seller and Reinsurer will make all appropriate adjustments to amounts due each other under this Agreement. With respect to any change required by reason of the requirement of any Governmental Authority or otherwise required by Applicable Law, Seller shall, to the extent practicable, prior to the effectiveness of any such change, promptly notify Reinsurer of such proposed change and afford Reinsurer (at the Reinsurers sole cost and expense) the opportunity, to the extent practicable, to object to such change under applicable administrative procedures (both formal and informal). 

   

 Section 4.3. _Follow the Fortunes_. Reinsurers liability shall attach simultaneously with that of Seller and shall be subject in all respects to the same risks, terms, conditions, interpretations, waivers, modifications, alterations, and cancellations as those of Seller under the Insurance Contract other than the Excluded Liabilities, the true intent of this Agreement being that Reinsurer shall, subject to the terms, conditions, and limits of this Agreement, follow the fortunes of Seller with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section shall not be construed to expand the liability of Reinsurer beyond what is specifically assumed under this Agreement.

 Section 5.1. _Consideration_. (a) As consideration for the reinsurance hereunder, on the Closing Date, Seller shall transfer to the Trustee for deposit to the Trust Account on behalf of Reinsurer cash equal to 100% of the Net Statutory Reserves as estimated by Seller as of the end of the last day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the Closing Date occurs (or, if the Closing Date occurs on or before the 15th day of a month, as of the end of the last day of the month that is second month immediately preceding the month in which the Closing Date occurs) (the " _Initial Reinsurance Premium_ "). The calculation of the Initial Reinsurance Premium shall be determined in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Estimated Statutory Balance Sheet (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). The Initial Reinsurance Premium will be subject to adjustment following the Closing Date as follows: 

   

 (i) Not later than 120 days after the Closing Date or such other time as is mutually agreed in writing by Reinsurer and Seller, Reinsurer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Seller a calculation of the Net Statutory Reserves as of the Effective Date (the " _Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation_ "). The Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation shall be determined in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Proposed Final Balance Sheets pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(ii) of the Purchase Agreement (the " _Proposed Final SAP Balance Sheet_ "). The parties shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation and the Proposed Final SAP Balance Sheet; 

  

 (ii) After delivery of the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation to Seller, Seller and a firm of independent public accountants and independent actuaries designated by Seller will be entitled to reasonable access during business hours to the relevant records and working papers of Reinsurer and its accountants and actuaries to aid in their review of the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation; 

  

 (iii) The Net Statutory Reserves determined by reference to the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation will be deemed to be accepted by and will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties except to the extent, if any, that Seller has delivered to Reinsurer within 45 days after the date on which the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation is delivered to Seller a written notice stating that Seller believes that either the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation contains mathematical errors or that the Net Statutory Reserves determined by reference to such calculation were not prepared in accordance with SAP applied in a manner consistent with its application in the preparation of the Reference SAP Balance Sheet. Seller may not challenge or object to the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation on any other basis. The written notice of objection must specify in reasonable detail (A) each and every item in the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation to which Seller objects, (B) the nature of any such objection, (C) the amount in question, (D) Sellers proposed change with respect to such items and (E) the reasons supporting Sellers positions; 

  

 (iv) If a proposed change by Seller is disputed by Reinsurer, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If parties reach agreement with respect to any disputed item, Reinsurer shall revise the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation to reflect 

   ##### 

  

 

such agreement, and such revised and agreed Proposed Statutory Reserves
Calculation will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties; 

   

 (v) If any such proposed change remains disputed after a period of 30 days following the date on which Seller gives Reinsurer the written notice of objection, then Reinsurer shall engage a nationally recognized independent registered public accounting firm or an independent actuary mutually acceptable to the parties (the " _Independent Consultant_ ") to resolve any remaining disputes; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a dispute is submitted to an independent accounting firm or independent actuarial firm pursuant to Section 2.3(b) of the Purchase Agreement, the Independent Consultant shall be the Independent Accountant or Independent Actuary, as applicable, as determined pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The Independent Consultant will act as an arbitrator to determine only those issues as to which Seller has disagreed in the notice of objection duly delivered pursuant to Section 5.05(a)(iii) that are disputed by Reinsurer. Reinsurer and Seller shall deliver written briefs in support of their positions to the Independent Consultant, and to one another within 20 Business Days after the matter is submitted to the Independent Consultant. Reasonable discovery will be permitted in any such arbitration proceeding, including the right to depose or obtain interrogatories from officers, employees or other representatives of the other party to the extent such Persons are knowledgeable about, or possess information regarding, matters relevant to any disputed item. In addition, during the review by the Independent Consultant, Reinsurer and Seller shall each make available to the Independent Consultant such individuals and such information, books, records and work papers, as may be required by the Independent Consultant to fulfill its obligations under this Section 5.1(a)(v);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the independent accountants and independent actuaries of Seller or Reinsurer shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to the Independent Consultant unless and until the Independent Consultant has signed a confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants or independent actuaries. The parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Consultant to issue its written determination regarding such disputed items within 30 days (and in any event such determination will be issued not later than 60 days) after such items are submitted for review. In no event may the Independent Consultants determination of disputed items be for an amount that is outside the range of Reinsurers and Sellers disagreement. The determination of the Independent Consultant will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties, and Reinsurer shall revise the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation to reflect such determination. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Consultant will be borne by Reinsurer and Seller in a proportion equal to the aggregate amount unsuccessfully disputed by such party over the total amount of items submitted to the Independent Consultant, as calculated by the Independent Consultant; 

  

 (vi) The Net Statutory Reserves determined by reference to the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation that becomes final, binding and conclusive on the parties pursuant to any of clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of this Section 5.01(a) are respectively referred to herein as the "Final Statutory Reserves." Within 5 Business Days following the date on which the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation is finalized in accordance with any of clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of this Section 5.01(a): 

   ##### 

  

  

 (A) if the Final Statutory Reserves are less than the Initial Reinsurance Premium, Reinsurer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such shortfall; and 

  

 (B) if the Final Statutory Reserves exceed the Initial Reinsurance Premium, Seller shall pay to Reinsurer an amount equal to such excess. 

  

 (b) As additional consideration for the reinsurance hereunder, Reinsurer shall be entitled to 100% of all premiums, refunds (other than refunds collected after the Effective Date with respect to commissions paid by Seller prior to the Effective Date with respect to an Insurance Contract, to which refund Seller shall be entitled) and other payments to the extent that such amounts are collected after the Effective Date by Seller or Reinsurer with respect to the Insurance Contracts. Seller hereby irrevocably and unconditionally assigns to Reinsurer forever all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to such premiums, refunds and other payments payable to Seller. Seller shall promptly remit to Reinsurer any such amounts received by Seller or its Affiliates. Seller hereby irrevocably appoints Reinsurer as its agent to collect all such amounts in Sellers name. If necessary for such collection, Seller shall reasonably cooperate, at Reinsurers expense (except as otherwise provided herein or in the Purchase Agreement), in any litigation or other matters relating to such collection. 

   

 (c) Reinsurer shall be entitled to all amounts actually collected under the Ceded Reinsurance Agreements, excluding (i) amounts collected under the Ceded Reinsurance Agreements to the extent that such amounts do not otherwise relate to the Insurance Liabilities and (ii) Excluded Profit Commissions. Seller hereby irrevocably and unconditionally assigns to Reinsurer forever all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to such reinsurance recoverables payable to Seller. Seller shall promptly remit to Reinsurer any such amounts received by Seller or its Affiliates. Reinsurer shall promptly remit to Seller any amounts with respect to the Ceded Reinsurance Agreements received by Reinsurer to the extent that such amounts do not otherwise relate to the Insurance Liabilities or are Excluded Profit Commissions.

 _COMMUTATION AND RELEASE_  

  

 Section 2.1 _Consideration_. 

  

 (a) As consideration for the commutation and release hereunder, on the Closing Date, Reinsurer shall transfer to Company cash equal to 100% of the Statutory Reserves as estimated by Reinsurer as of the end of the last day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the Closing Date occurs (or, if the Closing Date occurs on or before the 15th day of a month, as of the end of the last day of the month that is second month immediately preceding the month in which the Closing Date occurs) (the " _Initial Commutation Amount_ "). The calculation of the Initial Commutation Amount shall be determined in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Estimated Statutory Balance Sheet (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). The Initial Commutation Amount will be subject to adjustment following the Closing Date as follows: 

  

 (i) Not later than 120 days after the Closing Date or such other time as is mutually agreed in writing by Company and Reinsurer, Company shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Reinsurer a calculation of the Statutory Reserves as of the Effective Date (the " _Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation_ "). The Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation shall be determined in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Proposed Final Balance Sheet pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(ii)(B) of the Purchase Agreement (the " _Proposed Final SAP Balance Sheet_ "). The parties shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation and the Proposed Final SAP Balance Sheet; 

  

 (ii) After delivery of the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation to Reinsurer, Reinsurer and a firm of independent public accountants and independent actuaries designated by Reinsurer will be entitled to reasonable access during business hours to the relevant records and working papers of Company and its accountants and actuaries to aid in their review of the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation; 

  

 (iii) The Statutory Reserves determined by reference to the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation will be deemed to be accepted by and will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties except to the extent, if any, that Reinsurer has delivered to Company within 45 days after the date on which the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation is delivered to Reinsurer a written notice stating that Reinsurer believes that either the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation contains mathematical errors or that the Statutory Reserves determined by reference to such calculation were not prepared in accordance with SAP applied in a manner consistent with its application in the preparation of the Reference SAP Balance Sheet. Reinsurer may not challenge or object to the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation on any other basis. The written notice of objection must specify in reasonable detail (A) each and every item in the 

   ##### 

  

 

Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation to which Reinsurer objects, (B) the
nature of any such objection, (C) the amount in question, (D) Reinsurers
proposed change with respect to such items and (E) the reasons supporting
Reinsurers positions; 

   

 (iv) If a proposed change by Reinsurer is disputed by Company, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If parties reach agreement with respect to any disputed item, Company shall revise the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation to reflect such agreement, and such revised and agreed Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties; 

  

 (v) If any such proposed change remains disputed after a period of 30 days following the date on which Reinsurer gives Company the written notice of objection, then Company shall engage a nationally recognized independent registered public accounting firm or an independent actuary mutually acceptable to the parties (the " _Independent Consultant_ ") to resolve any remaining disputes; provided, however, that if a dispute is submitted to an independent accounting firm or independent actuarial firm pursuant to Section 2.3(b) of the Purchase Agreement, the Independent Consultant shall be the Independent Accountant or Independent Actuary, as applicable, as determined pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The Independent Consultant will act as an arbitrator to determine only those issues as to which Reinsurer has disagreed in the notice of objection duly delivered pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ that are disputed by Company. Company and Reinsurer shall deliver written briefs in support of their positions to the Independent Consultant, and to one another within 20 Business Days after the matter is submitted to the Independent Consultant. Reasonable discovery will be permitted in any such arbitration proceeding, including the right to depose or obtain interrogatories from officers, employees or other representatives of the other party to the extent such Persons are knowledgeable about, or possess information regarding, matters relevant to any disputed item. In addition, during the review by the Independent Consultant, Company and Reinsurer shall each make available to the Independent Consultant such individuals and such information, books, records and work papers, as may be required by the Independent Consultant to fulfill its obligations under this Section 5.1(a)(v);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the independent accountants and independent actuaries of Reinsurer or Company shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to the Independent Consultant unless and until the Independent Consultant has signed a confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants or independent actuaries. The parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Consultant to issue its written determination regarding such disputed items within 30 days (and in any event such determination will be issued not later than 60 days) after such items are submitted for review. In no event may the Independent Consultants determination of disputed items be for an amount that is outside the range of Reinsurers and Companys disagreement. The determination of the Independent Consultant will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties, and Company shall revise the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation to reflect such determination. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Consultant will be borne by Reinsurer and Company in a proportion equal to the aggregate amount unsuccessfully disputed by such party over the total amount of items submitted to the Independent Consultant, as calculated by the Independent Consultant; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (vi) The Statutory Reserves determined by reference to the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation that becomes final, binding and conclusive on the parties pursuant to any of clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of this _Section 2.1(a)_ are respectively referred to herein as the " _Final Statutory Reserves_." Within 5 Business Days following the date on which the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation is finalized in accordance with any of clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of this _Section 2.1(a)_. 

  

 (A) if the Final Statutory Reserves are less than the Initial Commutation Amount, Company shall pay to Reinsurer an amount equal to such shortfall; and 

  

 (B) if the Final Statutory Reserves exceed the Initial Commutation Amount, Reinsurer shall pay to Company an amount equal to such excess. 

  

 (b) Cash transferred pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ shall be by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by the party entitled thereto.

Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five (5) Business Days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim. 

  

 (b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); the Indemnifying Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Applicable Law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and a full and complete release is provided to the Indemnified Party. 

   

 (c) The provisions of this Article XVIII shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Such notice referred to in the preceding sentence shall state the relevant facts and include therewith relevant documents and a statement in reasonable detail as to the basis for the indemnification sought. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the Indemnifying Party in a timely manner shall not be deemed a waiver of the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification with respect to any claim made pursuant to this Section 18.3, other than to the extent that such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party.

  _CONSIDERATION; CEDED REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS_  

   

 Section 5.1. _Consideration_. (a) As consideration for the reinsurance hereunder, on the Closing Date, Company shall transfer to the Trustee for deposit to the Trust Account on behalf of Reinsurer cash equal to 100% of the Net Statutory Reserves as estimated by Company as of the end of the last day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the Closing Date occurs (or, if the Closing Date occurs on or before the 15th day of a month, as of the end of the last day of the month that is second month immediately preceding the month in which the Closing Date occurs) (the " _Initial Reinsurance Premium_ "). The calculation of the Initial Reinsurance Premium shall be determined in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Estimated Statutory Balance Sheet (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). The Initial Reinsurance Premium will be subject to adjustment following the Closing Date as follows: 

  

 (i) Not later than 120 days after the Closing Date or such other time as is mutually agreed in writing by Reinsurer and Company, Reinsurer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Company a calculation of the Net Statutory Reserves as of the Effective Date (the " _Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation_ "). The Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation shall be determined in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Proposed Final Balance Sheets pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(ii) of the Purchase Agreement (the " _Proposed Final SAP Balance Sheet_ "). The parties shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation and the Proposed Final SAP Balance Sheet; 

   

 (ii) After delivery of the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation to Company, Company and a firm of independent public accountants and independent actuaries designated by Company will be entitled to reasonable access during business hours to the relevant records and working papers of Reinsurer and its accountants and actuaries to aid in their review of the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation; 

   

 (iii) The Net Statutory Reserves determined by reference to the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation will be deemed to be accepted by and will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties except to the extent, if any, that Company has delivered to Reinsurer within 45 days after the date on which the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation is delivered to Company a written notice stating that Company believes that either the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation contains mathematical errors or that the Net Statutory Reserves determined by reference to such calculation were not prepared in accordance with SAP applied in a manner consistent with its application in the preparation of the Reference SAP Balance Sheet. Company may not challenge or object to the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation on any other basis. The written notice of objection must specify in reasonable detail (A) each and every item in the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation to which Company objects, (B) the nature of any such objection, (C) the amount in question, (D) Companys proposed change with respect to such items and (E) the reasons supporting Companys positions; 

       ##### 

  

     

 (iv) If a proposed change by Company is disputed by Reinsurer, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If parties reach agreement with respect to any disputed item, Reinsurer shall revise the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation to reflect such agreement, and such revised and agreed Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties; 

   

 (v) If any such proposed change remains disputed after a period of 30 days following the date on which Company gives Reinsurer the written notice of objection, then Reinsurer shall engage a nationally recognized independent registered public accounting firm or an independent actuary mutually acceptable to the parties (the " _Independent Consultant_ ") to resolve any remaining disputes; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a dispute is submitted to an independent accounting firm or independent actuarial firm pursuant to Section 2.3(b) of the Purchase Agreement, the Independent Consultant shall be the Independent Accountant or Independent Actuary, as applicable, as determined pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The Independent Consultant will act as an arbitrator to determine only those issues as to which Company has disagreed in the notice of objection duly delivered pursuant to Section 5.05(a)(iii) that are disputed by Reinsurer. Reinsurer and Company shall deliver written briefs in support of their positions to the Independent Consultant and to one another within 20 Business Days after the matter is submitted to the Independent Consultant. Reasonable discovery will be permitted in any such arbitration proceeding, including the right to depose or obtain interrogatories from officers, employees or other representatives of the other party to the extent such Persons are knowledgeable about, or possess information regarding, matters relevant to any disputed item. In addition, during the review by the Independent Consultant, Reinsurer and Company shall each make available to the Independent Consultant such individuals and such information, books, records and work papers, as may be required by the Independent Consultant to fulfill its obligations under this Section 5.1(a)(v); _provided_ , _however_ , that the independent accountants and independent actuaries of Company or Reinsurer shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to the Independent Consultant unless and until the Independent Consultant has signed a confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants or independent actuaries. The parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Consultant to issue its written determination regarding such disputed items within 30 days (and in any event such determination will be issued not later than 60 days) after such items are submitted for review. In no event may the Independent Consultants determination of disputed items be for an amount that is outside the range of Reinsurers and Companys disagreement. The determination of the Independent Consultant will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties, and Reinsurer shall revise the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation to reflect such determination. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Consultant will be borne by Reinsurer and Company in a proportion equal to the aggregate amount unsuccessfully disputed by such party over the total amount of items submitted to the Independent Consultant, as calculated by the Independent Consultant; 

   

 (vi) The Net Statutory Reserves determined by reference to the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation that becomes final, binding and conclusive on the parties pursuant to any of clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of this Section 5.01(a) are respectively referred to herein as the "Final Statutory Reserves." Within 5 Business Days following the date 

    ##### 

  

 

on which the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation is finalized in
accordance with any of clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of this Section 5.01(a): 

   

 (A) if the Final Statutory Reserves are less than the Initial Reinsurance Premium, Reinsurer shall pay to Company an amount equal to such shortfall; and 

   

 (B) if the Final Statutory Reserves exceed the Initial Reinsurance Premium, Company shall pay to Reinsurer an amount equal to such excess. 

   

 (b) As additional consideration for the reinsurance hereunder, Reinsurer shall be entitled to 100% of all premiums, refunds (other than refunds collected after the Effective Date with respect to commissions paid by Company prior to the Effective Date with respect to an Insurance Contract, to which refund Company shall be entitled) and other payments to the extent that such amounts are collected after the Effective Date by Company or Reinsurer with respect to the Insurance Contracts. Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally assigns to Reinsurer forever all of Companys right, title and interest in and to such premiums, refunds and other payments payable to Company. Company shall promptly remit to Reinsurer any such amounts received by Company or its Affiliates. Company hereby irrevocably appoints Reinsurer as its agent to collect all such amounts in Companys name. If necessary for such collection, Company shall reasonably cooperate, at Reinsurers expense (except as otherwise provided herein or in the Purchase Agreement), in any litigation or other matters relating to such collection. 

  

 (c) Reinsurer shall be entitled to all amounts actually collected under the Ceded Reinsurance Agreements, excluding amounts collected under the Ceded Reinsurance Agreements to the extent that such amounts do not otherwise relate to the Insurance Liabilities. Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally assigns to Reinsurer forever all of Companys right, title and interest in and to such reinsurance recoverables payable to Company. Company shall promptly remit to Reinsurer any such amounts received by Company or its Affiliates. Reinsurer shall promptly remit to Company any amounts with respect to the Ceded Reinsurance Agreements received by Reinsurer to the extent that such amounts do not otherwise relate to the Insurance Liabilities.

TRANSITION SERVICES 

  

 Section 2.1. _Transition Services_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, from and after the Closing and during the Term or, if applicable, for the periods of time set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto, Service Provider shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Service Recipient 

   ##### 

  

 

or, as directed by Service Recipient, the Acquired Companies or Service
Recipients other Affiliates, those services as set forth on _Exhibit A_
hereto (the " _Transition Services_ " and, together with any Omitted
Services, Knowledge Transfer or Additional Services (as defined below) that
may be added to the scope of the Services, the " _Services_ ") solely in
connection with the conduct of the Business, for substantially the same
purposes as provided to the Business as of the Closing Date. Service
Recipient will cause the Acquired Companies and any other Service Recipient
Affiliates receiving Services hereunder to comply with the provisions of this
Agreement, including all of the obligations of Service Recipient hereunder,
and Service Recipient shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of its
Affiliates. Service Recipient shall not, directly or indirectly, resell or
permit the use of any of the Services to or by any third Person (other than
an Acquired Company or an Affiliate of Buyer). In no event will any Service
Recipient, its Affiliates or their respective employees, third Person
technology consultants or other personnel be entitled to modify any of
Service Providers or its Affiliates systems or the Services. As a condition
to receiving the Services hereunder, Service Recipient shall cause each
Service Recipient Affiliate (including each Acquired Company) to agree to
execute and deliver to Service Provider on the Effective Date, or prior to
their receipt of Services hereunder, a written agreement to comply with and
abide by the provisions of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, none
of the Services shall include or require Service Provider to provide any
legal services or services of an attorney. 

   

 Section 2.2. _Omitted Services_. If, at any time within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days following the Effective Date, Service Recipient becomes aware of any other service that (a) had been provided by Service Provider or its Affiliates to the Acquired Companies or in connection with the Business prior to Closing but which was omitted from _Exhibit A_ other than by agreement of the Parties, (b) is reasonably necessary for the transition of the Business from Service Provider to Service Recipient or is reasonably necessary for the conduct of the Business as such Business was conducted in all material respects as of the Closing, and (c) Service Provider is able to perform using its commercially reasonable efforts and not prohibited from performing such service by Applicable Law or its agreements or licenses with any third party (an " _Omitted Service_ "), then upon providing a written notice to Service Provider within such 120-day period, the Parties shall meet as soon as practicable to work in good faith to determine the manner in which it is to be provided, any consents required to provide such service, and the fees and other terms and conditions applicable thereto, and upon mutual agreement to such terms and conditions such Omitted Service shall be deemed added to the scope of the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that any Omitted Services were performed by Continuing Business Employees prior to the Closing Date, then subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at Service Recipients cost and reasonable request, Service Provider shall provide the relevant Continuing Business Employees access to the relevant Service Provider systems to the extent reasonably necessary for such Continuing Business Employees to provide such Omitted Services to Service Recipient, but Service Provider shall not be required to provide such Omitted Services. 

  

 Section 2.3. _Knowledge Transfer_. Service Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, at all times during this Agreement, personnel with adequate knowledge to provide (a) the Services that Service Provider is required to provide hereunder, (b) information regarding the Services to assist the Buyer in the migration and integration of such Services and the related Business (" _Knowledge Transfer_ "). Service Provider shall make such 

   ##### 

  

 

personnel available at Buyers reasonable request (including reasonable
notice), at mutually agreeable times to provide such information to Service
Recipient, provided that such Knowledge Transfer does not unreasonably
interfere with Service Providers obligation to provide Services and perform
other obligations under this Agreement. 

   

 Section 2.4. _Additional Services_. 

   

 2.4.1 Service Recipient may request in writing that Service Provider provide additional services not otherwise provided as a Transition Service and not listed on _Exhibit A_ and which would not constitute an Omitted Service (each, a " _Requested Additional Service_ "), which request shall include a description of the service(s) requested to be performed and the associated business specifications. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Service Provider shall only be obligated to provide, or cause to be provided, a Requested Additional Service that (a) Service Recipient cannot obtain from a third party or provide to itself, in each case, on commercially reasonable terms; (b) Service Provider can provide using commercially reasonable efforts; and (c) is reasonably necessary for the transition of the Business to Service Recipient or is reasonably necessary for the conduct of the Business as such Business was conducted in all material respects as of the Closing and which was not omitted from _Exhibit A_ by agreement of the Parties (each, a " _Required Additional Service_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that any Required Additional Services were performed for the Business by Continuing Business Employees prior to the Closing Date, then subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at Service Recipients cost and reasonable request, Service Provider shall provide the relevant Continuing Business Employees with access to the relevant Service Provider systems to the extent reasonably necessary for such Continuing Business Employee to provide such Required Additional Service to Service Recipient, but Service Provider shall not be required to provide such Required Additional Services. 

   

 2.4.2 In the event Service Recipient gives Service Provider written notice that Service Recipient would like Service Provider to provide, or cause to be provided, a Required Additional Service, Service Provider shall have ten (10) Business Days after the date of receipt of Service Recipients request to notify Service Recipient as to whether Service Provider agrees that the Requested Additional Service is a Required Additional Service; provided that any change in Applicable Law that requires a change in an existing Service or the provision of an Additional Service shall be deemed a Required Additional Service, if such change or Additional Service meets the requirements of clauses (a) through (c) in Section 2.4.1. If there is a dispute as to whether the Requested Additional Service is a Required Additional Service, it shall be resolved in accordance with Section 6\. If Service Provider determines, or it is determined pursuant to the dispute resolution procedure set forth in Section 6, that a Requested Additional Service is a Required Additional Service, then within ten (10) Business Days after Service Providers notification or such determination pursuant to Section 6, Service Provider shall provide Service Recipient with a written proposal (" _Required Additional Service Proposal_ ") for such Required Additional Service. Each such Required Additional Service Proposal submitted by Service Provider shall refer to the service description provided by Service Recipient and shall include the estimated time and price of performing the Required 

   ##### 

  

    

Additional Service and any anticipated potential impact on the then-existing
Services and any fees related thereto. If the Parties agree on Service
Providers Required Additional Service Proposal or a written variation
thereof, such Required Additional Services shall be deemed added to the scope
of the Services and Service Provider shall perform or cause to be performed
such Required Additional Service in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and such agreed upon Required Additional Service Proposal or
such written variation thereof. 

   

 2.4.3 If the Requested Additional Service is not a Required Additional Service (such service being a " _Discretionary Additional Service_ " and, together with any Required Additional Services, the " _Additional Services_ "), and if the Parties agree on a written proposal from Service Provider to provide such requested Discretionary Additional Service (a " _Discretionary Additional Service Proposal_ ") or a written variation thereof, such Discretionary Additional Services shall be deemed added to the scope of the Services and Service Provider shall perform, or cause to be performed, such Discretionary Additional Service in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such agreed upon proposal. Each such Discretionary Additional Service Proposal submitted by Service Provider shall refer to the service description provided by Service Recipient and shall include the estimated time and price of performing the Discretionary Additional Service and any anticipated potential impact on the then-existing Services and any fees related thereto. 

   

 2.4.4 The costs of any third-Person consents for Additional Services or Change Requests (as set forth below), access to systems, data or materials of Service Recipient or its Affiliates, and the option in Section 4.4 shall be borne by the Service Recipient, which consents (for the avoidance of doubt) will not be subject to the TSA Consent Cost Cap. 

   

 2.4.5 Service Providers Change Request Proposals and proposals for Additional Services will include an estimate of (a) the lifecycle cost of providing and maintaining the change or Additional Service and (b) the costs required to enable Service Provider to recoup any up-front investment for such change or Additional Service during the Term. 

  

 Section 2.5. _Services; Change Requests_. Service Recipient may request in writing a change to any Service, which request shall include a description of the proposed change requested and the associated business specifications (each a " _Change Request_ "). Service Provider shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the date of receipt of the Change Request (unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Parties), provide Service Recipient with a written proposal for changing the applicable Service in accordance with the Change Request (" _Change Request Proposal_ "), provided that such a proposal can be provided by Service Provider personnel then-assigned to perform the Services without materially impairing their ability to perform their Service obligations in a timely manner, or Service Recipient consents to a reprioritization of the Services to allow such personnel to provide such proposal within such timeframe. Each such Change Request Proposal shall include the estimated time and price of implementing the Change Request and any anticipated potential impact of the Change Request on the Service being provided by Service Provider and any fees related thereto. The Parties shall act in good faith 

   ##### 

  

 

concerning Change Requests, and shall not unreasonably cause any material
delay implementing any such Change Request that is mutually agreed to by the
Parties. If the Parties agree upon a Change Request, this Agreement shall be
deemed amended to include the terms and conditions of such agreed-upon Change
Request. 

   

 Section 2.6. _Subcontractors; Third-Person Suppliers and Personnel_. 

   

 2.6.1 Service Provider reserves the right to subcontract the performance of any of the Services to another provider, including third Persons and Service Providers Affiliates, (each, a " _Subcontractor_ ") and to engage third-Person suppliers to provide components of the Services, such as printing and telecommunication vendors, _provided_ , that Service Provider shall always remain responsible for (a) the performance of all Services in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, including service levels, quality and costs set forth herein and (b) compliance by any Subcontractor and third-Person suppliers with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (c) any failures of such Subcontractor and third-Person suppliers to comply with Service Providers obligations under this Agreement (to the same extent as if such failures were caused by Service Provider); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the engagement of any third-Person Subcontractor or supplier shall be subject to Service Recipients prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, only if the engagement of such third-Person Subcontractor or supplier will result in a material increase in Service Recipients net total costs of receiving the Services unless the engagement of such third-Person Subcontractor is required to comply with Applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , such consent is deemed given for any third Person involved in providing services to the Business during the twelve (12) month period immediately prior to the Effective Date. 

   

 2.6.2 Service Provider, its Affiliates and their respective Subcontractors will have the right, in their sole discretion, to (a) designate which personnel they will assign to perform the Services and (b) remove and replace such personnel at any time. In performing their respective duties hereunder, all Service Provider personnel shall be under the direction, control and supervision of Service Provider, its Affiliates and their respective Subcontractors and the foregoing shall have the sole right to exercise all authority with respect to the employment (including termination of employment), assignment and compensation of such personnel. 

  

 Section 2.7. _Electronic and Other Access_. If and to the extent that the performance or receipt of Services hereunder requires that a Partys personnel have access to any of the other Partys or its Affiliates intranet or other computer software, networks, hardware, technology or computer-based resources (including third-Person services, e-mail and access to computer networks, database and equipment) or if such Partys personnel is otherwise provided access to any of the foregoing in connection with the Services, such access shall be for the limited purposes of this Agreement and subject to compliance by such Partys personnel with the security, use, virus protection, disaster recovery and confidentiality policies of the other Party (or, if applicable, its third-Person providers). In the event of non-compliance by a Party or its personnel with any of the foregoing policies of the other Party, the other Party shall have the right to terminate such access to the personnel who are not in compliance with such policies 

   ##### 

  

 

(and, if and to the extent provided in such policies of the other Party,
restore such access following reasonable assurances that such non-compliance
shall not recur). 

   

 Section 2.8. _Standard of Performance_. 

   

 2.8.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Service Provider shall provide the Services, or cause any Affiliates and Subcontractors to provide the Services, (a) in accordance with Applicable Law with respect to the provision of the Services; and (b) in a professional and workmanlike manner that is at a level generally consistent in all material respects with the level of service provided by Service Provider to the Acquired Companies immediately prior to execution of the Purchase Agreement or the level that Service Provider provides similar services for itself or its Affiliates. Exhibit B sets forth Service Provider target services levels as of the Effective Date with respect to services Service Provider provides to itself and its Affiliates. 

   

 2.8.2 Except as expressly set forth herein, and subject to _Article X_, Service Recipient (on behalf of it and its Affiliates) acknowledges and agrees that the Services are provided as-is, that Service Recipient (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) assumes all risks and liabilities arising from or relating to its use of and reliance upon the Services and that Service Provider (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) makes no representation or warranty with respect thereto. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, SERVICE PROVIDER (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS AFFILIATES) HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS REGARDING THE SERVICES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY IN REGARD TO QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, NONINFRINGEMENT, COMMERCIAL UTILITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OF THE SERVICES FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 

   

 2.8.3 Service Recipient and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for their own compliance with Applicable Law in the operation of their respective businesses and Service Provider shall be responsible for its and its Affiliates compliance with Applicable Law in the provisions of the Services. Service Recipient shall be responsible for its and its Affiliates compliance with Applicable Law in the receipt and use of the Services. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a representation or warranty by Service Provider that any Service or Work Product complies with or is sufficient to satisfy Service Recipients obligations under Applicable Law. 

  

 Section 2.9. _Exception to Obligation to Provide Services_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Service Provider shall not be obligated to provide any Services if the provision of such Services would violate any agreement or license or any Law to which Service Provider or any other provider are subject; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event the provision of such Services would violate any Law or any agreement or license to which Service Provider or any other providers are subject (e.g., where Service Provider is unable to obtain a third-Person consent for which it is responsible hereunder, to permit Service Provider to provide the Transition Services or Omitted Services hereunder), (i) at the election of Service Recipient, Service Provider shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (or with respect to the 

      ##### 

  

    

Transition Services and Omitted Services, its reasonable best efforts) to
provide (1) such Services in a manner that does not violate any agreement or
license or any Applicable Law to which Service Provider or any other
providers are subject or, if such efforts are unsuccessful, (2)
a commercially reasonable alternative to such Services and (ii) any costs and
expenses incurred by Service Provider in connection with arranging to provide
the Services in a manner that does not violate any agreement or license or
Law to which Service Provider or any other providers are subject shall be
borne by the Parties as set forth in Section 6.6 of the Purchase Agreement
with respect to the consents required for the Transition Services and Omitted
Services (consistent with Section 6.6 of the Purchase Agreement), and by
Service Recipient with respect to any Additional Services, Change Requests or
the exercise of the option in Section 4.4. For the avoidance of doubt,
Section 6.6 of the Purchase Agreement addresses the responsibilities of the
Parties with respect to consents, and alternative arrangements if consents
cannot be obtained, to provide the Transition Services and Omitted
Services. 

   

 Section 2.10. _Change in Services_. Service Recipient acknowledges that Service Provider, its Affiliates and Subcontractors also use or provide to third parties services and systems that involve the same software, hardware, circuits, personnel and other resources as those used to provide the Services. Service Provider may, from time to time, reasonably supplement, modify, substitute or otherwise alter the Services and such other resources from time to time based on Service Providers business needs, subject to Service Provider following its normal change notification and change management procedures. Consistent with Service Providers normal technology change procedures, Service Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid making or minimize the adverse impacts of changes to systems that are used primarily to provide the Services to Service Recipient, if such change is not required for compliance with Applicable Law and would (i) materially adversely affect the quality, functionality or permanently availability of such Services, or (ii) materially increase the cost of using such Services. 

   

 Section 2.11. _No Agency_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed in any way or for any purpose to constitute Service Provider acting as an agent of Service Recipient in the conduct of its business. Service Provider shall act as an independent contractor and not as the agent of Service Recipient or its Affiliates in performing such Service. 

   

 Section 2.12. _Excuse of Performance_. Service Providers failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement shall be excused (and any rights of Service Recipient arising as a consequence of such failure shall not be exercised by Service Recipient) if and to the extent such Service Provider non-performance is caused by (i) the breach of this Agreement or tortious actions of Service Recipient or a third Person acting for or on behalf of Service Recipient or its Affiliates or (ii) the failure of any Service Recipient or such third Person to perform Service Recipients obligations under this Agreement or otherwise comply with Service Providers work processes, policies and procedures (as applicable generally to Service Provider, with respect to services it provides to itself, and/or any other third-Persons to which Service Provider provides services similar to the Services) and any requirements under Service Provider third-Person contracts, in each case of which Service Recipient was given notice (which notice shall be in writing, through an intranet posting, through email or through another reasonable means), provided Service Provider gives Service Recipient prompt written notice of any such impediment to its performance of any Services. Service Provider will use its commercially reasonable efforts 

      ##### 

  

    

to mitigate the effect of any such impediment on its provision of the Services
notwithstanding such failure by Service Recipient, provided that Service
Recipient works with Service Providers governance team to remedy such
failure. In the case of actions or failure as described in clause (i) or (ii)
above, respectively, Service Recipient shall be responsible for any additional
costs incurred by Service Provider in connection with providing the Service
as a result of such actions or failure. 

   

ARTICLE III 

   

RECORDS AND ACCESS 

  

 Section 3.1. _Records_. During the Term and for one (1) year thereafter, Service Provider shall maintain, and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective Subcontractors (to the extent permitted by the applicable Subcontractor agreement) to maintain, true and correct records of all receipts, invoices, reports and other available documents relating to the Services and this Agreement to the extent that Service Provider maintains such information with respect to similar services that it provides to its own operations (or the Parties agree to the creation of additional documents regarding the Services as an Additional Service), in accordance with Service Providers standard accounting practices and procedures, consistently applied. 

  

 Section 3.2. _Audit and Inspection_. During the Term and for one (1) year thereafter, Service Provider shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective Subcontractors to (to the extent permitted by the applicable Subcontractor agreement), afford, at Service Recipients sole cost and expense, Service Recipient, its Affiliates and their respective representatives, reasonable access not more than two (2) times in any calendar year during normal business hours and without material disruption to the business operations of Service Provider, its Affiliates or their respective Subcontractors, as reasonably necessary for Service Recipient to inspect and verify Service Providers compliance with the terms of this Agreement, _provided_ that (i) Service Recipient gives Service Provider reasonable prior written notice of any such audit, (ii) in no event shall Service Recipient have any right to access (A) any confidential information of Service Provider or its Affiliates that does not pertain to the Services provided to Service Recipient or (B) any confidential information of any of Service Providers or its Affiliates respective consumers or customers, (iii) such audit shall be conducted in compliance with Service Providers then-current safety and security rules and procedures, and (iv) the individuals conducting such inspection shall execute a confidentiality agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_. In the event that any such inspection establishes a material failure of Service Provider to comply with the terms of this Agreement or an overcharge for any Service, Service Provider shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective Subcontractors, to use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly correct such material failure or, as the case may be, to credit or reimburse Service Recipient for any such overcharge. 

  

ARTICLE IV 
 TERM AND TERMINATION 

   

 Section 4.1. _Term_. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated in accordance with _Article IV_, expire on the earlier of (i) the thirty-sixth (36th)

 4.2.5 The Parties may mutually agree in writing to terminate this Agreement in its entirety or with respect to one or more Services at any time. 

  

 Section 4.3. _Effects of Expiration or Termination_. 

   

 4.3.1 In the event this Agreement expires or is terminated pursuant to Sections 4.2.2 or 4.2.5 or ARTICLE XI (with respect to a Force Majeure Event that impacts Service Provider, but does not impact any Service Recipient site or facility), Service Recipient shall not be liable for any early termination charge, including any third-Person charges to Service Provider such as "kill fees," wind-down costs, breakage fees, early termination fees or charges, minimum volume make-up charges, other start-up or wind-down costs incurred by Service Provider.

In the event that Service Provider enters into a contract with a third-Person supplier that provides for early 

   ##### 

  

    

termination fees in excess of $350,000 (a "New Contract"), Service Provider
will make Service Recipient aware of the New Contract and such early
termination fees, and Service Recipient shall be entitled to consent to being
responsible for such early termination fees under such New Contract, provided
that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by Service
Recipient, except that such consent shall not be required if such
New Contract is required for Service Provider to be able to provide the
Services. In the event this Agreement expires or is terminated for any
reason, Service Recipient shall pay Service Provider all amounts due to
Service Provider for Services provided or to be provided through the
effective date of such expiration or termination (including the early
termination fees and other amounts described above in this Section 4.3.1, as
applicable), within thirty (30) days after Service Recipients receipt of an
invoice for such amounts by Service Provider in accordance with _Section
9.2_. 

   

 4.3.2 Expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Service shall not act as a waiver of any breach of this Agreement and shall not act as a release of either Party for any liability or obligation incurred under this Agreement through the effective date of such expiration or termination, including with respect to any Fees or Out-of-Pocket Expenses that accrued on or before the effective date of such expiration or termination. 

   

 4.3.3 As promptly as practicable upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or, if applicable, upon earlier termination of any particular Service (a) each Party will deliver to the other Party all materials and property in its possession or control (or the possession or control of an Affiliate) which are owned by or licensed from a third Person by such other Party or its Affiliates (including, in the case of Service Provider, any Work Product in whatever state of completion, but excluding such materials and property that Service Provider requires to provide to Service Recipient any Services that are not so terminated), and (b) subject to Service Providers records retention policy and Applicable Law, Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to delete from Service Providers systems (and to delete or cause to be deleted from the systems of Service Providers Subcontractors, as the case may be) all Work Product and Confidential Information belonging to Service Recipient that are no longer needed for Service Provider to fulfill its obligations under, or obtain the benefits under, this Agreement, the Purchase Agreement or the other Ancillary Agreements. Subject to Service Recipients records retention policy and Applicable Law, Service Recipient shall use commercially reasonable efforts to delete from Service Recipients systems all Confidential Information belonging to Service Provider that is no longer needed for Service Recipient to fulfill its obligations under, or obtain the benefits under, this Agreement, the Purchase Agreement or the other Ancillary Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall require Service Provider to delete any such Work Product or Confidential Information that is commingled with data or information of Service Provider or its Affiliates or would require deletion from any back-up or disaster recovery media; _provided_ , that such Work Product and Confidential Information on such media is not accessed or used for any purpose other than restoration of information and data of such Party commingled with such Work Product and Confidential Information or as may be required by Applicable Law. 

  

 Section 4.4. _Option to Purchase Service Provider s Personal Lines Platform_. 

   ##### 

  

   

 4.4.1 4.4.1 For purposes of this Section 4.4, (a) "Personal Lines Software Platforms" means the computer applications that Service Provider uses to process personal lines insurance business, excluding all third-Person software and other third-Person Intellectual Property used therewith or incorporated therein, and (b) "Personal Lines Hardware" means the hardware used to operate the Personal Lines Software Platforms. Exhibit E hereto lists (i) the key components of the Personal Lines Software Platforms as of the Effective Date (the listed items include both third-Person software and Service Provider proprietary software), and (ii) the key components of the Personal Lines Hardware as of the Effective Date. The Parties will update Exhibit E from time to time to reflect the components of the Personal Lines Software Platforms and Personal Lines Hardware that are actually used in production to perform the Services. 

   

 4.4.2 Subject to Service Recipient obtaining all applicable consents, at Service Recipients expense, Service Recipient, or its designee(s), shall have the right (but not the obligation) to: 

  

       | (i)  |   | purchase, or assume the lease for,
any information technology hardware assets (other than software) that
are owned or leased by Service Provider, or its Affiliates and that are used
by Service Provider or its Affiliates solely to perform the Services,
including the Personal Lines Hardware owned or leased by Service Provider
that is set forth in Exhibit E hereto.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | obtain all of Service Providers rights in
the Personal Lines Software Platforms used solely to provide the
Services, but excluding any software licensed by Service Provider from any
third Person and excluding any software owned by Service Provider that is
not used solely to perform the Services ("Purchased Software"); and  
      
    | (iii)  |   | obtain a perpetual, irrevocable,
nonexclusive, transferable, sub-licenseable (through multiple tiers),
royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid up license to use, copy, perform,
display, edit, modify, adapt, translate, exhibit, publish, transmit,
distribute and prepare derivative works of any other software owned by
Service Provider that is used by Service Provider to perform the Services
(but is not solely used to perform the Services).  
   

   

If Service Recipient elects the option described in this Section 4.4, the
hardware and software provided as part of such option shall be transferred on
an "as-is" basis without any warranties, express or implied, as to the
condition of such equipment and software. To the extent Service Provider is
permitted to do so under its agreement with the applicable manufacturer,
Service Provider will pass-through to Service Recipient any
manufacturers warranty (if any) on the Personal Lines Hardware transferred
to Service Provider under this Section 4.4. Such hardware conveyance by
Service Provider to 

   ##### 

  

    

Service Recipient or its designee(s) shall be at fair market value (as
determined by a neutral appraiser to be agreed-upon by the Parties in good
faith). The conveyance and license provided for in Sections 4.4.2(ii) and
(iii), respectively, are provided at no additional cost, however, Service
Recipient will be responsible for the costs of shipping and implementing such
information technology assets it acquires pursuant to this Section 4.4, and
for Service Providers infrastructure environment and separation costs
associated with separating the assets purchased pursuant to this Section 4.4.
For the avoidance of doubt, Service Provider shall not be required to provide

Hardware transferred and the software conveyed and licensed above. 

   

 4.4.3 In the event Service Recipient exercises its rights pursuant to this Section 4.4, Service Recipient shall and hereby does grant to Service Provider and its Affiliates a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable (except as provided for in this Section 4.4.3 with respect to Divested Businesses), royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid up license to use, copy, perform, display, edit, modify, adapt, translate, exhibit, publish, transmit, distribute and prepare derivative works of the Purchased Software for the business purposes of Service Provider and its Affiliates. Service Provider and its Affiliates may grant sublicenses of the licenses granted under this Section 4.4.3 to Divested Businesses. As used herein, "Divested Business" means an Affiliate, business unit or other portion of the business of Service Provider and its Affiliates that Service Provider or any of its Affiliates divests (whether by stock or asset sale, merger, or otherwise). The Parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing license does not permit Service Provider, its Affiliates or any Divested Business to use the Purchased Software for or on behalf of itself or any third Person to provide services that are competitive with the Business (other than any arrangements with third-Persons that may be in place on the Effective Date). 

   

 4.4.4 Service Recipient may exercise its rights pursuant to this Section 4.4 at any time after December 31, 2011 during the Term of this Agreement, provided that Service Recipient gives Service Provider at least 120 calendar days written notice prior to such exercise or the expiration of the Term, whichever is earlier (the " _Option Deadline Date_ "). In the event Service Recipient has not given Service Provider written notice of its exercise of its rights under this Section 4.4 on or before the Option Deadline Date, Service Recipient shall be deemed to have waived its rights under this Section 4.4. In the event that Service Recipient exercises its rights pursuant to this Section 4.4, any Services provided using the information technology assets transferred to Service Recipient shall be deemed terminated upon the effective date of such transfer. The Parties will meet prior to such transfer to discuss which of the Services will be terminated as a result of such transfer. The effective date of such transfer shall not be prior to Service Provider separating the applicable hardware and software components from the other portions of Service Providers environments, and removing from all items to be transferred to Service Recipient all commercial lines and other data that is not specific to the Business. 

   

 4.4.5 In the event Service Recipient exercises its rights under Section 4.4 and Service Provider or its Affiliates reasonably concludes that they require the use of all or any part of the transferred assets, Service Recipient and Service Provider or its Affiliate 

   ##### 

  

    

shall enter into a transition services agreement (under which Service
Recipient would provide services to Service Provider) with a term not to
exceed one (1) year upon substantially the same terms as this Agreement.
Service Provider shall be excused from its obligations hereunder to the
extent Service Providers ability to perform such obligations is adversely
affected due to Service Recipients exercising its rights under this
Section 4.4. The Personal Lines Software Platform currently operates on a
mainframe computing platform. The Parties agree to discuss the feasibility of
a project to modify such software to operate on a new computing platform
(e.g., servers) for transfer to Service Recipient under the option provided
in this Section 4.4. If the Parties mutually determine that such project is
feasible (from both a technology and Service Provider resource perspective)
and would not violate Applicable Law or Service Providers agreements with
third Persons, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to agree on the terms
and conditions for such project to be performed as Discretionary Additional
Services.

The Services Managers will also discuss progress in the transition of the Services hereunder and may establish a set of procedures, including frequency of meetings and reporting, and other reasonable structures for their cooperation and the cooperation of the Parties in the execution of their obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, all communications relating to this Agreement and the Services shall be directed to the Services Managers.

substitute manager with comparable job scope, knowledge, expertise and
decision-making authority. 

   

 Section 6.2. _Dispute Resolution_. The Parties agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a "Dispute") shall be first submitted for resolution to the Services Managers. If the Services Managers fail to resolve a Dispute within a reasonable time following its submission to the Services Managers, but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days, then at the request of either Party, such Dispute shall be submitted to a senior officer of each of the Parties, and such senior officers shall attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute. If such senior officers cannot resolve the Dispute in such manner within a reasonable time, but in no event more than twenty (20) Business Days, then at the request of either Party, the Dispute shall be submitted to arbitration as described in Section 6.3. The Parties agree that all discussions, negotiations and other information exchanged between the Parties during the foregoing escalation proceedings shall be without prejudice to the legal position of a Party in any subsequent litigation or arbitration proceeding. 

  

 Section 6.3. _Arbitration_. In the event that a Dispute is not resolved by the Services Managers or senior offers of the Parties within the time periods specified in Section 6.2, then either Party may initiate arbitration proceedings to resolve the Dispute upon notice to the other Party, and as provided in this Section 6.3. The arbitration shall be conducted in New York, New York by a panel of three (3) arbitrators in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"), JAMS or another mutually agreeable nationally recognized arbitration organization. Each Party shall appoint one neutral (1) arbitrator and the two (2) arbitrators appointed by the Parties shall appoint a third neutral arbitrator within thirty (30) calendar days after the appointment of the second arbitrator. The third arbitrator shall act as chair of the tribunal. If any of the three (3) arbitrators is not appointed within the time prescribed above, then upon the request of any Party, the arbitration organization selected by the Parties, which, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary between the Parties, shall be the AAA, shall appoint that arbitrator. Judgment upon the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant Party or its assets. Service Recipient and Service Provider shall deliver written briefs in support of their positions to the arbitrators and to one another within twenty (20) Business Days after the Dispute is submitted to the arbitrators.

The Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the arbitrators to issue a written determination regarding the Dispute within thirty (30) calendar days (and in any event such determination will be issued not later than sixty (60) calendar days) after such items are submitted for review. In no event may the arbitrators determination of a Dispute be for an amount that is outside the range of the Parties disagreement. The determination of the arbitrator 

   ##### 

  

 

will be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties. The fees, costs and

 Section 6.4. _Specific Performance_.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Service Provider covenants that, with respect to any Personally Identifiable Information, Service Provider, its Affiliates and their respective Subcontractors shall (a) comply with all applicable Privacy Laws; (b) keep all Personally Identifiable Information confidential and not disclose or use any Personally Identifiable Information except only to the extent necessary to exercise its rights or perform its obligations hereunder; (c) when acting as a data processor, only process Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with the instructions of Service Recipient; (d) except with respect to the provision of Services hereunder or as otherwise agreed by the Parties, not disclose any Personally Identifiable Information to any other Person (including Service Providers third-Person Subcontractors) without the prior written consent of Service Recipient and an agreement in writing from such other Person to comply, among other things, with the terms of this _Section 8.1.2_ and (e) maintain (and shall cause all third Persons consented to by the other Party to receive Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with the foregoing subsection (d) to maintain) adequate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of all Personally Identifiable Information, provided that Subcontractors or other third-Person suppliers involved in the performance of Services as of the Effective Date shall not be required to comply with the foregoing requirements in this subsection (e) until March 1, 2012.

 9.1.1 the prices and compensation set forth on _Exhibit A_ for the Services (other than Additional Services and Omitted Services); 

   

 9.1.2 all charges of any Subcontractors, third-Person suppliers, and Affiliates of Service Provider (which, for the sake of clarity, shall be determined in accordance with the principal set forth in the last paragraph of this Section 9.1) for any Service it provides hereunder on a pass-through basis without markup by Service Provider; 

   

 9.1.3 compensation for any Omitted Services, Additional Services and services that are the subject of Change Requests (the amounts described in Sections 9.1.1, 9.1.2 and 9.1.3 are collectively, the " _Fees_ "); and 

   

 9.1.4 all of Service Providers actual, reasonable and documented out of pocket expenses in connection with the provision of Services by Service Provider or receipt of Services by Service Recipient ( _e.g.,_ travel expenses); _provided_ , that out-of-pocket expenses in excess of (A) fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) for a single expense or (B) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for aggregate expenses in a given month will not be incurred without the prior written approval of Service Recipient, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed (" _Out-of-Pocket Expenses_ "). Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the amount of Out-of-Pocket Expenses. 

 

For the avoidance of doubt, (i) Service Provider shall be entitled to invoice
Service Recipient for charges of Service Providers Affiliates in providing
any Services under this Agreement (which charges, for the sake of clarity,
shall be determined in accordance with the principle set forth in (ii)), and
(ii) the prevailing principle in the calculation of the consideration for the
Services is that neither Service Provider nor any Affiliates of Service
Provider, will sustain a loss, or earn a profit, as a result of the provision
of such Services. 

       ##### 

  

     

 Section 9.2. _Payment_. Commencing with the calendar month ending in the first month following the Effective Date, Service Provider shall provide Service Recipient with a single monthly invoice (a " _TSA Monthly Invoice_ ") by the fifteenth (15th) day of the month following the end of each calendar month for (i) all Fees for Services rendered by Service Provider or its Affiliates during such month and (ii) all Out-of-Pocket Expenses incurred by Service Provider or its Affiliates during such month. The Parties acknowledge that there may be a lag in the submission of charges from third-Persons or the invoicing of Fees that are based on the costs incurred in providing the Services (e.g., due to analysis of usage statistics) relating to the provision of the Services, that Service Provider shall be entitled to be compensated for such charges and Fees, and that Service Provider shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such third-Person invoices and determine the Fees, and to provide same to Service Recipient in a timely manner. Payment of all amounts in each TSA Monthly Invoice shall be due and payable by Service Recipient to Service Provider within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of such TSA Monthly Invoice by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Service Provider, subject to Fees or Out-of-Pocket Expenses disputed in accordance with Section 9.3. 

  

 Section 9.3. _Fee Dispute Resolution_. If Service Recipient disputes in good faith any particular Fees or Out-of-Pocket Expenses incurred during such month set forth in an invoice (each, a " _Disputed Amount_ "), Service Recipient shall promptly, but in no event later than thirty (30) calendar days after the receipt of such invoice, notify Service Provider of such dispute (along with a detailed description of the basis for such dispute), and the Parties shall escalate the matter for resolution through the escalation procedures set forth in _Section 6_ and shall promptly implement any remedy determined in accordance therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Service Recipient shall pay all amounts not in dispute on the applicable invoice in accordance with _Section 9.2_. 

  

 Section 9.4. _Sales Taxes_. _Sales Taxes_. All consideration under this Agreement is exclusive of any sales, transfer, value-added, goods, gross receipts, services or similar Tax (including any such Taxes that are required to be withheld, but excluding all other Taxes including Taxes based upon or calculated by reference to income or capital) imposed against or on services provided (" _Sales Taxes_ ") by Service Provider hereunder. Such Sales Taxes shall be separately stated on the relevant invoice to Service Recipient. All taxable goods and services for which Service Recipient is compensating, or reimbursing, Service Provider shall be set out separately from non-taxable goods and services, if practicable. Service Recipient shall be responsible for any such Sales Taxes and shall either (i) remit such Sales Taxes to Service Provider (and Service Provider shall remit the such amounts to the applicable taxing authority) or (ii) provide Service Provider with a certificate or other acceptable proof evidencing an exemption from liability for such Sales Taxes. If Service Recipient is required to make any deduction or withholding on account of Sales Taxes from any amount payable to Service Provider hereunder, Service Recipient shall pay to Service Provider such additional amounts (" _Additional Amounts_ ") as may be necessary so that Service Provider shall receive the full amount otherwise payable in respect of such payments had no such Sales Taxes (including any Sales Taxes payable in respect of Additional Amounts) been required to be deducted or withheld. In the event Service Provider fails timely to invoice Sales Taxes on taxable goods or services covered by this Agreement, Service Provider shall notify Service Recipient in a timely manner and Service Recipient shall remit such Sales Taxes to Service Provider; _provided_ , _however_ , that 

   ##### 

  

 

Service Recipient shall not be responsible for the payment of any additions to
such Sales Taxes, including penalties and interest imposed due to a failure
by Service Provider to remit or cause to be remitted such Sales Taxes in a
timely manner to the appropriate taxing authority, unless such failure
relates to the failure of Service Recipient to pay to Service Provider
the amount of the Sales Taxes properly invoice in accordance with the terms
herein. Service Recipient shall not be required to indemnify Service Provider
for any taxes other than Sales Taxes and, to the extent that any tax other
than a Sales Tax is required to be withheld or deducted by Service Recipient,
Service Recipient has the right to withhold or deduct the amount of such tax
from any consideration under this Agreement and such amount shall be treated
as paid for purposes of this Agreement.

Incremental Hardware Charges to Service Recipient in relation to Service
Recipients usage relative  
   

 

Exhibit A-5  #####

Business) (for example, system performance or system outage), Service
Provider is entitled, without notice to Service Recipient to take whatever
steps necessary to correct the problem and restore the system to normal
operation. Once the problem has been resolved, it will then be determined if
the corrective action has caused the system to exceed any Base Utilizations.

has been resolved, however, root cause analysis continues across BTS. Once
the root cause is determined, the incident ticket is updated and closed. The
owner of the outage is responsible to notify the Severity One Manager
and Enterprise Support Center.  
  



  |   |   
  

Severity -1X 

  |   | A problem that does not deny availability of a product or service;
however; the issue impacts premium, billing, commissions or is of a financial
nature which critically impedes the customers processing of business.  
  



  |   |   
  

Severity -2 

  |   | A problem which may deny the use of a critical product or
service threatening future productivity.  
   

   

Exhibit B-4   ##### 

  

  

       |   |

The Information includes (i) the provisions and existence of this agreement, (ii) any other information, data, materials or records that have been or will be furnished by or through OneBeacon that are marked as "proprietary" or "confidential" or which, under all of the circumstances, ought reasonably to be treated as proprietary and/or confidential (including, but not limited to, information, data, materials and records relating to business affairs, data, designs, manuals, training materials and documentation, formulas, ideas, inventions, knowledge of manufacturing processes, mask-works, methods, prices, financial and accounting data, products and product specifications, systems and technical information of OneBeacon), and (iii) all information, data, materials and records created or generated in connection with the Audit. 

  

 Recipient hereby agrees as follows: 

  

 1. Auditor wishes to have access to the Information for purposes of conducting an audit of OneBeacons services provided to Tower Group, Inc. ("Tower") under that certain Transition Services Agreement between OneBeacon Insurance Group LLC and Tower dated as of [Closing Date] (the "TSA") as provided in Section 3.2 of the TSA (the "Audit").
