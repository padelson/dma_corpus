commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Consultant to issue its written
determination regarding such disputed items within 30&nbsp;days (and in any event such determination

will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties, and Reinsurer shall revise the Proposed
Statutory Reserves Calculation to reflect such determination. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Independent Consultant will be borne by Reinsurer and Seller in a proportion equal to the aggregate
amount unsuccessfully disputed by such party over the total amount of items submitted to the
Independent Consultant, as calculated by the Independent Consultant;

Consultant. Reasonable discovery will be permitted in any such arbitration proceeding, including
the right to depose or obtain interrogatories from officers, employees or other representatives of
the other party to the extent such Persons are knowledgeable about, or possess information
regarding, matters relevant to any disputed item. In addition, during the review by the
Independent Consultant, Company and Reinsurer shall each make available to the Independent
Consultant such individuals and such information, books, records and work papers, as may be
required by the Independent Consultant to fulfill its obligations under this Section&nbsp;5.1(a)(v);
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the independent accountants and independent actuaries of
Reinsurer or Company shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to the Independent
Consultant unless and until the Independent Consultant has signed a confidentiality and hold
harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such independent accountants or independent actuaries. The parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Consultant to issue its written
determination regarding such disputed items within 30&nbsp;days (and in any event such determination
will be issued not later than 60&nbsp;days) after such items are submitted for review. In no event may
the Independent Consultant&#146;s determination of disputed items be for an amount that is outside the
range of Reinsurer&#146;s and Company&#146;s disagreement. The determination of the Independent Consultant
will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties, and Company shall revise the Proposed
Statutory Reserves Calculation to reflect such determination. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Independent Consultant will be borne by Reinsurer and Company in a proportion equal to the
aggregate amount unsuccessfully disputed by such party over the total amount of items submitted to
the Independent Consultant, as calculated by the Independent Consultant;

Policyholders or Claimants of the Insurance Contracts out of its own accounts or out of accounts
established by Administrator in the name of Company pursuant to Section&nbsp;17.2 hereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, any such direct payment to a Policyholder or a Claimant of an Insurance
Contract shall, to the extent of such payment, discharge any obligation of Administrator to make
such payment to Company under the Excluded Business Reinsurance Agreement in respect of such Claim.

Administrator to make direct payment of Claims to Policyholders or Claimants of the Insurance
Contracts, Administrator may establish and maintain separate accounts in the name of the Company
with banking institutions to provide the Administrative Services (the &#147;<U>Bank Accounts</U>&#148;).
Administrator shall have exclusive authority over the Bank Accounts including, without limitation,
the exclusive authority to (a)&nbsp;designate the authorized signatories on the Bank Accounts, (b)&nbsp;issue
drafts on and make deposits in the Bank Accounts in the name of Company and (c)&nbsp;make withdrawals
from the Bank Accounts. At Administrator&#146;s request, Company shall do all things reasonably
necessary to enable Administrator to open, maintain and access the Bank Accounts including, without
limitation, executing and delivering such depository resolutions and other documents as may be
requested from time to time by the banking institutions. The Company agrees that without
Administrator&#146;s prior written consent it shall not make any changes to the authorized signatories
on the Bank Accounts nor attempt to withdraw any funds therefrom. Administrator shall provide and
own all funds deposited in the Bank Accounts. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
Administrator may pay Claims directly to Policyholders or Claimants of the Insurance Contracts on
check stock of Administrator.

Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by, or an action,
proceeding or investigation instituted by, any Person not a party to this Agreement (a &#147;<U>Third

Days after such Indemnified Party learns of the Third Party Claim; <U>provided</U>,

provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced
as a result of such failure (except that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnified Party failed to give such notice).
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five (5)&nbsp;Business
Days after the Indemnified Party&#146;s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including
court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense
thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such
defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to
employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party.
If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, all of the parties
hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party&#146;s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability with
respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); the Indemnifying Party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnified Party&#146;s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) unless (A)&nbsp;there is no finding or admission of any violation of Applicable Law or any
violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against

the independent accountants and independent actuaries of Company or Reinsurer shall not be
obligated to make any working papers available to the Independent Consultant unless and until the

access to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent
accountants or independent actuaries. The parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Independent Consultant to issue its written determination regarding such disputed
items within 30&nbsp;days (and in any event such determination will be issued not later than 60&nbsp;days)
after such items are submitted for review. In no event may the Independent Consultant&#146;s
determination of disputed items be for an amount that is outside the range of Reinsurer&#146;s and
Company&#146;s disagreement. The determination of the Independent Consultant will be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties, and Reinsurer shall revise the Proposed Statutory Reserves Calculation
to reflect such determination. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Consultant will be
borne by Reinsurer and Company in a proportion equal to the aggregate amount unsuccessfully
disputed by such party over the total amount of items submitted to the Independent Consultant, as
calculated by the Independent Consultant;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Each Party will be excused for any failure or delay in performing any of its obligations under this
