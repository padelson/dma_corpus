-16-  2.6 _Non-Assignment of Assets_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement will not constitute an agreement to
assign or transfer and will not effect the assignment or transfer of any
Purchased Asset if (a) an attempted assignment thereof, without the approval,
authorization or consent of, or granting or issuance of any license or permit
by, any third party thereto (each such action, a " _Necessary Consent_ "),
would constitute a breach thereof or in any way adversely affect the rights of
Purchaser thereunder and (b) the Bankruptcy Court has not entered an Order
providing that such Necessary Consent is not required. In such event, Sellers
and Purchaser will use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Necessary Consents with respect to any such Purchased Asset or any claim or
right or any benefit arising thereunder for the assignment thereof to
Purchaser as Purchaser may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Sellers will not be obligated to pay any consideration therefor to any third
party from whom consent or approval is requested or to initiate any litigation
or legal proceedings to obtain any such consent or approval. If such Necessary
Consent is not obtained, or if an attempted assignment thereof would be
ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of any Seller thereunder so
that Purchaser would not in fact receive all such rights, such Seller and
Purchaser will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement, to the extent
feasible and at no expense to such Seller, under which Purchaser would obtain
the benefits and assume the obligations thereunder in accordance with this
Agreement, including subcontracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to
Purchaser, or under which such Seller would enforce for the benefit of
Purchaser with Purchaser assuming such Sellers obligations and any and all
rights of such Seller against a third party thereto.

2.7 _Depots_. At any time prior to the Closing, Purchaser may by written
notice to Sellers remove any Depots from _Schedule 1.1(a)_. If Purchaser
timely provides such notice, the Depots included in such notice, including
all facilities, improvements, fixtures and other appurtenances thereto, will
thereafter be deemed to be Excluded Assets for purposes of this Agreement.

 

2.8 _Further Conveyances and Assumptions_. From time to time following the
Closing, Sellers and Purchaser will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further conveyances,
notices, assumptions, assignments, releases and other instruments, and will
take such further actions, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to
assure fully to Purchaser and its respective successors or assigns, all of
the properties, rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and
privileges intended to be conveyed to Purchaser under this Agreement and to
assure fully to each Seller and its Affiliates and their successors and
assigns, the assumption of the liabilities and obligations intended to be
assumed by Purchaser under this Agreement, and to otherwise make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section
2.8_ will require Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to assume any Liabilities
other than the Assumed Liabilities.

Seller to make any payment under or to the increased, additional, accelerated

reasonably be expected to have, a Seller Material Adverse Effect. To the
Knowledge of Sellers, there are no physical defects in the buildings located
at any of the Owned Real Property which would interfere with the use

adjoining property for any purpose inconsistent with the use of the Owned Real

not, individually or in the aggregate, be material. To the Knowledge of
Sellers, no Person is violating any Intellectual Property exclusively
licensed to any Seller under an Intellectual Property License that is a

(c) the obligation to pay Assumed Cure Costs under _Section 2.5_. Except as
set forth on _Schedule 5.7_ , no event has occurred which, with the passage of
time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default under or a
violation of any such Purchased Contract or would cause the acceleration of
any obligation of any Seller or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, any other party
thereto or the creation of a Lien upon any Purchased Asset, except for such
events that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Sellers have delivered or

Contracts, together with all amendments, modifications or supplements

6.7 _Condition of the Business_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Sellers are
not making any representations or warranties whatsoever, express or implied,
beyond those expressly given by Sellers in Article V hereof (as modified by
the Schedules hereto), and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except for
the representations and warranties contained therein, the Purchased Assets and
the Business are being transferred on a "where is" and, as to condition, "as
is" basis. Each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges that it has conducted to
its satisfaction its own independent investigation of the Business and, in
making the determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, each of Parent and Purchaser has relied on the results of its
own independent investigation.

VII. BANKRUPTCY COURT MATTERS

7.1 _Competing Transaction_. This Agreement is subject to approval by the
Bankruptcy Court and the consideration by Sellers and the Bankruptcy Court of
higher or better competing bids. From and after the date hereof until the date
that the auction contemplated by the Bidding Procedures Order is declared
closed by Sellers (the " _Auction Date_ "), Sellers are permitted to cause
their respective representatives and Affiliates to initiate contact with, or
solicit or encourage submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers by, any
Person (in addition to Parent, Purchaser and their Affiliates, agents and
representatives) with respect to any transaction (or series of transactions)
involving the direct or indirect sale, transfer or other disposition of all,
or a material portion of, the Purchased Assets to a purchaser or purchasers
other than Purchaser or effecting any other transaction (including a Chapter
11 plan) the consummation of which would be substantially inconsistent with
the transactions herein contemplated (a

 



-29-   " _Competing Transaction_ ") to the extent, but only to the extent, that the
Company determines in good faith that so doing is permitted or required by the
Bidding Procedures Order. 

7.2 _Break-Up Fee_. In the event that (a) this Agreement terminates pursuant
to _Section 4.4(e)_ by Purchaser or pursuant to _Section 4.4(h)_, and (b) a
Competing Transaction is consummated, then Sellers will pay to Purchaser in
cash an amount (the " _Break-Up Fee_ ") equal to the Cash Amount multiplied by
the greater of (i) 3.5%; or (ii) the Alternative Sale Break-Up Fee Percentage
(as defined below). The Break-Up Fee shall be paid in cash concurrently with
the consummation (which, in the case of a plan of reorganization or
liquidation, shall be the effectiveness) of the first Competing Transaction
to occur simultaneously with or following the termination of this Agreement,
and shall be paid from the first proceeds of such Competing Transaction and
from each succeeding Competing Transaction prior to payment of any other
claims including claims secured by the assets that are the subject of the
Competing Transaction (other than claims arising under the Credit Agreement,
dated as of February 3, 2009, among Interstate Bakeries Corporation and
certain of its affiliates and General Electric Capital Corporation (as
amended, the " _ABL Agreement_ ")) until the Break-Up Fee is paid in full. The
Break-Up Fee will constitute, pursuant to sections 364 and 503 of
the Bankruptcy Code, a superpriority administrative expense claim in each of
Sellers bankruptcy estates with priority over any and all administrative
expense claims other than claims arising under the ABL Agreement. Any Break-Up
Fee payable pursuant to this Agreement will be allowed and paid, without any
further Bankruptcy Court approval or order. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, upon timely payment of the Break-Up Fee to
Purchaser in accordance with this  _Section 7.2_, Sellers and their
respective representatives and Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and
Purchaser and their respective representatives and Affiliates, on the other
hand, will be deemed to have fully released and discharged each other from
any Liability resulting from the termination of this Agreement and neither
Sellers and their respective representatives and Affiliates, on the one hand,
and Parent and Purchaser and their respective representatives and Affiliates,
on the other hand, nor any other Person will have any other remedy or cause of
action under or relating to this Agreement or any applicable Law, including
for reimbursement of expenses. The " _Alternative Sale Break-Up
Fee Percentage_ " shall equal the highest breakup fee percentage (which
breakup fee percentage shall include all breakup, expense reimbursement,
topping and similar fees) approved by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with
the sale by one or more of the Sellers of assets totaling at least $10
million. In the event such approval occurs after payment by the Sellers to
Purchaser hereunder of the Break-Up Fee, any additional amounts owed in
respect of the Break-Up Fee shall have the same protections in terms of
priority and method of payment as the payment of the original Break-Up Fee as
set forth above. Sellers will not qualify any bid to participate in the
auction contemplated by the Bidding Procedures Order that does not include at
a minimum a cash consideration sufficient to repay both any amounts
outstanding under the ABL Agreement and the Break-Up Fee.

7.3 _Bankruptcy Court Filings_. Sellers will file with the Bankruptcy Court a
motion seeking entry of the Bidding Procedures Order and the Sale Order.
Sellers will 

 



-30-   attach to such motion and propose the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order
and the Sale Order. Subject to _Section 7.1_, Sellers will thereafter pursue
diligently the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order and the Sale Order,
including in the case of the Sale Order in a form that satisfies in full the
Sale Order Condition. Purchaser agrees that it will promptly take such actions
as are reasonably requested by Sellers to assist in obtaining entry of the
Bidding Procedures Order and the Sale Order and a finding of adequate
assurance of future performance by Purchaser of the Purchased Contracts,
including furnishing affidavits or other documents or information for
filing with the Bankruptcy Court for the purposes, among others, of providing
necessary assurances of performance by Purchaser under this Agreement and
demonstrating that Purchaser is a "good faith" purchaser under section 363(m)
of the Bankruptcy Code. In the event that the entry of the Bidding Procedures
Order or the Sale Order is appealed or a stay pending appeal is sought,
Sellers will oppose the appeal or the stay pending appeal and seek the
dismissal of any appeal (including a petition for certiorari, motion for
rehearing, reargument, reconsideration or revocation). Sellers will provide
Purchaser at least 24 hours notice in advance of filing with the Bankruptcy
Court or any appellate court any motion, brief, notice, proposed order,
amendment, supplement or other pleading that Sellers propose to file in the
Bankruptcy Court relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Sellers will give Purchaser reasonable advance notice of any
hearings regarding the motions required to obtain the issuance of the Sale
Order and Purchaser will have the right to attend and seek to be heard at any
such hearings.

VIII. COVENANTS

8.1 _Access to Information_. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser will be
entitled, through its officers, employees, consultants and representatives
(including, without limitation, its legal advisors and accountants), to make
such investigation of the properties, businesses and operations of
the Business and such examination of the books and records of the Business,
the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as it reasonably requests and
to make extracts and copies of such books and records. Any such investigation
and examination will be conducted upon reasonable advance notice and under
reasonable circumstances and will be subject to restrictions under applicable
Law. Sellers will direct and use their best efforts to cause their respective
officers, employees, consultants, agents, accountants, attorneys and other
representatives to cooperate with Purchaser and Purchasers representatives in
connection with such investigation and examination, and Purchaser and its
representatives will cooperate with Sellers and their representatives.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such investigation or
examination will be permitted to the extent that it would require Sellers to
disclose information that is competitively sensitive or subject to attorney-
client privilege. No investigation by Purchaser prior to or after the date of
this Agreement will affect or be deemed to modify any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of Sellers contained in this Agreement.
Sellers will promptly deliver to Purchaser all pleadings, motions, notices,
statements, schedules, applications, reports and other papers filed in any
other judicial or administrative proceeding related to the Business, the
Purchased Assets and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
Purchaser may reasonably request.

 



-31-  8.2 _Actions Pending the Closing_. (a) Except (1) as required by
applicable Law or by order of the Bankruptcy Court, (2) as otherwise
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, or (3) with the prior written
consent of Purchaser, during the period from the date of this Agreement to and
through the Closing Date, Sellers will:

(i) maintain the Purchased Assets in their current condition, ordinary wear
and tear excepted; 

(ii) take reasonable actions to defend and protect the Purchased Assets from
infringement or usurpation; and 

(iii) comply with applicable Laws, including Environmental Laws, other than
with respect to the failure of such compliance as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) Except (1) as required by applicable Law or by order of the Bankruptcy
Court, (2) as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, or (3) with the prior
written consent of Purchaser, during the period from the date of this
Agreement to and through the Closing Date, Sellers will not in connection with
the Business:

(i) subject any of the Purchased Assets to any Lien (except for Permitted
Exceptions);

(ii) assign, license, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of any of
the Purchased Assets (except for the purpose of disposing of obsolete assets);

 

(iii) enter into any Contract for the sale of any Owned Real Property;

 

(iv) terminate, amend, restate, supplement or waive any rights under any
Purchased Contract; or

 

(v) agree to do anything prohibited by this _Section 8.2(b)_.

 

(c) Sellers will promptly notify Purchaser of: (i) any notice or other written
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) the commencement of any material
Legal Proceedings relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 8.2(c)_ will not (x) limit or otherwise affect any remedies
available to Purchaser, or (y) be deemed to amend or supplement any
Schedule or prevent or cure any misrepresentations or breach of warranty.

8.3 _Consents_. Sellers will use their commercially reasonable efforts, and
Purchaser will, and Parent will cause Purchaser to, cooperate with Sellers, to
obtain at the earliest practicable date all consents and approvals
contemplated by this

 



-32-   Agreement, including, without limitation, the consents and approvals
referred to in _Section 5.3(b)_ hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers
will not be obligated to pay any consideration therefor to any third party
from whom consent or approval is requested or to initiate any litigation or
proceedings to obtain any such consent or approval.

8.4 _Regulatory Approvals_. (a) Parent, Purchaser and Sellers will (i) make or
cause to be made all filings required of each of them or any of their
respective Affiliates under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and, in any
event, within 10 Business Days after the entry of the Bidding Procedure Order
in the case of all filings required under the HSR Act and within four weeks
in the case of all other filings required by other Antitrust Laws, (ii) comply
at the earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws for additional information, documents or other materials
received by each of them or any of their respective subsidiaries from Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") or any other
Governmental Body in respect of such filings or such transactions, and (iii)
cooperate with each other in connection with any such filing (including, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, providing copies of all such documents
to the non-filing parties prior to filing and considering all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and in
connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any of the
FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental Body under any Antitrust
Laws with respect to any such filing or any such transaction. Each such party
will use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each such party will promptly inform the other parties hereto of
any oral communication with, and provide copies of written
communications with, any Governmental Body regarding any such filings or any
such transaction. No party hereto will independently participate in any formal
meeting with any Governmental Body in respect of any such filings,
investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior
notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body,
the opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable law, the
parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto
relating to proceedings under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. Sellers
and Purchaser may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate
any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section
8.4_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained
therein will be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and
will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or
directors of the recipient, unless express written permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Sellers or Purchaser, as the
case may be).

(b) Each of Parent, Purchaser and Sellers will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by
any Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the

 



-33-   Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States
federal or state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative or judicial doctrines or other Laws that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the " _Antitrust Laws_ ").
In connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
is in violation of any Antitrust Law, each of Parent, Purchaser and Sellers
will cooperate and use its commercially reasonable efforts to contest and
resist any such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent (" _Antitrust Order_ "), that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative action,
unless, by mutual agreement, Parent, Purchaser and Sellers decide that
litigation is not in their respective best interests. Each of Parent,
Purchaser and Sellers will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take
such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods
under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as
promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement. In connection with
and without limiting the foregoing, but subject to _Section 8.4(d)_, each of
Parent, Purchaser and Sellers agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Antitrust Laws that may be asserted by any
Federal, state and local and non-United States antitrust or competition
authority, so as to enable the parties to close the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible.

 

(c) Subject to _Section 8.4(d)_, if required by the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or other Governmental Body in order to obtain clearance under or to
terminate any waiting period required by any Antitrust Law or to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Antitrust Order that would have
the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the Outside
Date, each of Parent and Purchaser will propose, negotiate, offer to commit
and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent
decree, hold separate Order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition
of Purchased Assets or aspects of the Business or otherwise offer to take or
offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking
(collectively, a " _Divestiture Action_ "), and if the offer is accepted, take
or commit to take, such action that limits its freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, any of the Purchased Assets or aspects of the
Business. Parent and Purchaser will promptly advise Sellers of any Divestiture
Action required by the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental Body
and any negotiations with respect thereto. For purposes of this _Section
8.4_, a Divestiture Action will be considered "required" by the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or other Governmental Body only if and to the extent that
Parent or Purchaser has been notified by the FTC, the Antitrust Division, or
such other Governmental Body that the failure or refusal to take such
Divestiture Action would result in the filing of Legal Proceedings seeking
an Antitrust Order that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



-34-  (d) Nothing in this Agreement will require, or be construed to require,
Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates, in order to obtain clearance
under, or to terminate any waiting period required by, Antitrust Law or to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Antitrust Order
(whether or not the foregoing would have the effect of preventing or delaying
the Closing beyond the Termination Date) to (the matters in (i), (ii) and
(iii) below, an " _Antitrust Condition_ "):

 

(i) agree to any restriction, condition or limitation (including any sale,
divestiture, disposition, change in business practice or other transaction or
any requirement to hold separate) with respect to any asset, business or
property of Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates (other than the
Purchased Assets or the Business) or with respect to any asset, business or
property which Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates acquires or
transfers or has or hereafter has an unconsummated contract to acquire or to
transfer (other than with respect to the Purchased Assets or the Business);
or 

(ii) take or refrain from taking any action with respect to the acquisition,
sale, divestiture, disposition, change in business practice or other
transaction involving directly or indirectly any asset, business or property
of any other Person (other than the Purchased Assets or the Business) or in
any market (other than markets in which the Business is conducted, but only
as to the conduct of such Business); or

(iii) take any Divestiture Action with respect to (A) any portion of the
Merita Assets (excluding Merita Plants) or of the Merita Business (excluding
Merita Plants) that generated or represented, in the aggregate, an amount
equal to or in excess of 25% of the Merita Sales, (B) more than 2 of the
Merita Plants, or (C) any portion (1) of the Purchased Assets, other than the
Merita Assets, or (2) of the Business, other than the Merita Business, that
generated or represented, in the aggregate, an amount equal to or in excess
of 10% of the aggregate net revenues of the Business, excluding the Merita
Sales, for the trailing 52 weeks ended October 20, 2012.

8.5 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,
each of Parent, Purchaser and each Seller will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) take all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) cause the fulfillment at
the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to their respective
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent, Purchaser and Sellers will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to defend any Legal Proceedings which
would prevent the condition to Closing described in  _Section 9.1(f)_ from
being satisfied, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Body with respect thereto
vacated or reversed, and shall cooperate with each other in connection with
the foregoing.

 



-35-  8.6 _Publicity_. The initial press release concerning this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby will be in substantially the form
previously agreed by the parties. Prior to the Closing, none of the parties
hereto will issue any press release concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval
of the other party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, unless, in the sole judgment of Parent or Sellers, disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law or by the Bankruptcy Court with respect
to filings to be made with the Bankruptcy Court in connection with this
Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that the party intending to make such
release uses its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such
applicable Law or Bankruptcy Court requirement to consult with the other party
with respect to the text thereof. After the Closing, the parties may issue
public announcements regarding the transactions contemplated hereby so long as
such announcements, in the case of announcements made by Sellers, do not
disclose the specific terms or conditions of this Agreement except where such
terms and conditions have already been disclosed as required by Law,
applicable stock exchange regulation or in filings that any Seller has made
in the Bankruptcy Court; provided, however, that the issuing party will use
its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such applicable Law or
Bankruptcy Court requirement to consult with the other party with respect to
the text thereof.

8.7 _Supplementation and Amendment of Schedules_. Sellers may, at
their option, include in the Schedules items that are not material in order
to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any references to dollar
amounts, will not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or representation that
such items are material, to establish any standard of materiality or to
define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement.
Information provided in one Schedule will suffice, without repetition or cross
reference, as a disclosure of such information in any other Schedule to which
its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face. From time to time prior to
the Closing, Sellers will have the right to supplement or amend the Schedules
with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered after the delivery
of the Schedules pursuant to this Agreement. No such supplement or amendment
will have any effect on the satisfaction of the condition to closing set forth
in _Section 9.1(a)_.

 

8.8 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent hereby guarantees the full and timely
performance of all of Purchasers agreements and covenants made in this
Agreement and each other document executed and delivered by or on behalf of
Parent or Purchaser to Sellers at Closing with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

8.9 _Names and Marks_. (a) Purchaser hereby acknowledges that all right, title
and interest in and to the Retained Trademarks are owned exclusively by
Sellers.

(b) Purchaser will, for a period of 60 days after the Closing Date, have a
non-exclusive license, solely in connection with the operation of the
Business, to use all of the existing stocks of signs, letterheads, invoice
stock, packaging, advertisements and promotional materials, inventory and
other tangible materials included in the Purchased Assets that contain
Retained Trademarks.

 



-36-  (c) Purchaser will ensure that all use of the Retained Trademarks as provided
in this  _Section 8.9_ shall be only with respect to goods and services of a
level of quality equal to or greater than the quality of goods and services
with respect to which the Retained Trademarks were used in the Business prior
to the Closing. Any and all goodwill generated by the use of the Retained
Trademarks under this _Section 8.9_ shall inure solely to the benefit of
Sellers. In no event shall Purchaser use the Retained Trademarks in any manner
that may damage or tarnish the reputation of Sellers or the goodwill
associated with the Retained Trademarks.

(d) Purchaser agrees that no Seller shall have any responsibility for claims
by third parties arising out of, or relating to, the use by Purchaser of any
Retained Trademarks after the Closing. Purchaser will indemnify and hold
harmless Sellers from any and all claims that may arise out of the use
thereof by Purchaser in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
_Section 8.9_, other than such claims that the Retained Trademarks infringe
the Intellectual Property rights of any third party. In addition to any and
all other available remedies, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless
Sellers from any and all claims that may arise out of the use of the Retained
Trademarks in violation of or outside the scope permitted by this _Section
8.9_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser
hereby acknowledges that Sellers, in addition to any other remedies available
to them for any breach or threatened breach of this _Section 8.9_, shall be
entitled to a preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order or other
equivalent relief restraining Purchaser and any of its Affiliates from any
such breach or threatened breach.

(e) Sellers will use their commercially reasonable efforts, and Purchaser
will, and Parent will cause Purchaser to, cooperate with Sellers, to obtain at
the earliest practicable date the consent and approval of Grupo Bimbo, S.A.
B. DE C.V. (as successor in interest to SB Royalty Company, Inc.) under that
certain License Agreement, dated as of April 19, 1989, by and between SB
Royalty Company, Inc. and Interstate Brands Company  Licensing Co. (the "
_SB License Agreement_ ") to allow Sellers to grant Purchaser a perpetual,
royalty free, non-exclusive, non-assignable, sublicense (without the right to
grant sublicenses) to use the Trademark "DItaliano" in connection with the
operation of the Business in the "Territory" (as defined in the SB License
Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers will not be obligated to pay
any consideration therefor or to initiate any litigation or legal proceedings
to obtain any such consent or approval. In the event that such consent and
approval is obtained, Sellers and Purchasers shall, for a period of no less
than 30 days, negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions of a written
agreement governing the sublicensing of the Trademark "DItaliano" to
Purchaser.

 

(f) Except as expressly set forth in this _Section 8.9_, no other right or
license is granted to Purchaser by implication or otherwise with respect to
any of the Retained Trademarks.

(g) The provisions of this _Section 8.9_ will survive the Closing.

 



-37-  8.10 _Recipes_. (a) Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, and subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Sellers, on behalf of themselves
and their Affiliates, hereby grant to Purchaser a non-exclusive, non-
transferrable (other than in connection with the sale of all or substantially
all of the Purchased Trademarks), fully paid-up, perpetual, license (without
the right to grant sublicenses) to use the Licensed Recipes solely in
connection with the operation of the Business. Purchaser may not use or
otherwise exploit any Licensed Recipes for any other business purposes. Upon
the written request of Purchaser within 3 months after the Closing Date,
Sellers will provide Purchaser with copies of the Licensed Recipes.

(b) Except as expressly set forth in this _Section 8.10_, no other right or
license is granted to Purchaser by implication or otherwise with respect to
any Retained Recipes, including, but not limited to, the right to use any
Retained Recipes other than the Licensed Recipes. Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that all right, title and interest in and to the Retained Recipes are
owned exclusively by the Sellers or their Affiliates and, except as
specifically set forth herein, nothing in this Agreement grants Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates, by implication or otherwise, any license or right to
use any Retained Recipes, whether in connection with the Business, the
products or services of the Business, or otherwise. Purchaser will promptly
destroy or purge any copies of any Retained Recipes (other than Licensed
Recipes) to which Purchaser may otherwise have access and which Purchaser
knows to be a Retained Recipe, whether in connection with the Purchased
Assets, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise.

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that the Retained Recipes are valuable and
proprietary to Sellers and their Affiliates. Purchaser agrees that, from and
after the Closing, it will not disclose any Retained Recipes to any Person
except (i) to those of its Affiliates and personnel as are necessary in
connection the use of the Licensed Recipes in accordance with _Section
8.10(a)_, strictly on a need-to-know basis, (ii) as required by Law (
_provided_ , _however_ , that if permitted Purchaser shall not make any such
disclosure without first notifying Sellers and allowing Sellers a reasonable
opportunity to seek injunctive relief with respect to such disclosure), (iii)
as the same may otherwise become available in the public domain or generally
available within the baking industry, or become known to Purchaser
independently without any obligation of confidentiality, other than through
any action by Purchaser in violation of its obligations under this  _Section
8.10_.

(d) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the remedies at law for any breach
of this  _Section 8.10_ are inadequate and that the damages resulting from
any such breach are not readily susceptible to being measured in monetary
terms. Accordingly, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that upon any breach by
it of the terms and conditions of this _Section 8.10_, Sellers and their
Affiliates will be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief and to seek
any order restraining any threatened or future breach from any court of
competent jurisdiction.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 8.10_ shall survive the Closing.

 



-38-  8.11 _Patents, Copyrights and Trade Secrets_. (a) Effective upon, and only
upon, the Closing, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Sellers, on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates, hereby grant to
Purchaser a non-exclusive, non transferable (other than in connection with the
sale of all or substantially all of the Purchased Trademarks), fully paid-up,
perpetual, license (without the right to grant sublicenses) to use the
Patents, Copyrights and Trade Secrets (other than Recipes) owned by Sellers
that, prior to the Closing, were used in connection with the Business and
that are not included in the Purchased Assets, in each case solely in
connection with the Business. Purchaser may not use or otherwise exploit any
such Patents, Copyrights or Trade Secrets for any other business purposes.

(b) Except as expressly set forth in this _Section 8.11_, no other right or
license is granted to Purchaser by implication or otherwise with respect to
any of Sellers Patents, Copyrights or Trade Secrets.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 8.11_ shall survive the Closing.

8.12 _Confidentiality_. Purchaser acknowledges that Confidential Information
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) has been, and in the future will
be, provided to it in connection with this Agreement, including under _Section
8.1_, and is subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement between
Parent and Purchaser, dated January 11, 2013 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Purchaser acknowledges and understands that this Agreement may be publicly
filed in the Bankruptcy Court and further made available by Sellers to
prospective bidders and that such disclosure will not be deemed to violate any
confidentiality obligations owing to Purchaser, whether pursuant to
this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise. Effective upon,
and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate.
Sellers acknowledge that from and after the Closing, all non-public
information relating to the Business, including the Purchased Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities, will be valuable and proprietary to Purchaser and its
Affiliates. Sellers agree that, from and after the Closing, no Seller will,
and Sellers will cause their Subsidiaries not to, disclose to any Person any
non-public information relating to Purchaser and its Affiliates, or the
Business, including the Purchased Assets, and the Assumed Liabilities, except
as required by Law or as otherwise becomes available in the public domain
other than through any action by any Seller in violation of its obligations
under this _Section 8.12_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the
remedies at law for any breach of this _Section 8.12_ are inadequate
and that the damages resulting from any such breach are not readily
susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, each party
acknowledges and agrees that upon any breach by it of the terms and conditions
of this _Section 8.12_, the other party will be entitled to seek immediate
injunctive relief and to seek an order restraining any threatened or future
breach from any court of competent jurisdiction. The provisions of this
_Section 8.12 _will survive the Closing. 

8.13 _Plant Closings_. Sellers have ceased production at the Plants and, prior
to the Closing Date, will clean and sanitize such Plants and the Purchased
Assets located there in accordance with accepted industry practices, will
ready such Plants and

 



-39-   Purchased Assets for ongoing maintenance and preservation without production
until the Closing. Sellers will keep and turn over to Purchaser updated
equipment maintenance records and other documentation of the cleaning and
other work performed customary for such activities.

8.14 _Employee Matters_. Sellers have terminated the employment of all
Employees of the Business located at the Plants and the Depots, other than any
such Employees necessary for purposes of providing the cleaning and other
Plant closing activities at such Plants provided for in  _Section 8.13_.
Sellers shall terminate the employment of such other Employees of the Business
prior to the Closing. Sellers will retain and be solely responsible for all
Liabilities that relate to any Employees employment with any Seller Entity
and, if applicable, their termination of employment from any Seller Entity,
including all such Liability arising under the WARN Act, any CBAs, the
Employee Benefit Plans or the Multiemployer Plans or otherwise and including
any such Liabilities to Employees arising from the effect of, or in any way
related to, the sale of the Purchased Assets on Employees. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser will have no Liability whatsoever
under the WARN Act based on actions taken at or before the Closing, any CBA,
the Employee Benefit Plans or the Multiemployer Plans (including for unpaid
contributions or withdrawal Liability in connection with any of the forgoing
whether such Liability arises before or after the Closing), nor will
Purchaser become a participating employer in, or make contributions to, any
such Employee Benefit Plans or the Multiemployer Plans. Purchaser will have no
obligation to employ or to consider employing any Employee on or after the
Closing. If any Employees are hired by Purchaser, Purchaser will not be
obligated to provide any particular level of compensation or benefits to such
Employees except as Purchaser may otherwise agree.

X. TAXES

10.1 _Transfer Taxes_. All documentary, stamp, transfer, motor vehicle
registration, sales, use, excise and other similar non-income Taxes and all
filing and recording fees (and any penalties and interest associated with
such Taxes and fees) arising from or relating to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_
") will be borne 50% by Purchaser and 50% by Sellers, regardless of the party
on whom liability is imposed under the provisions of the Laws relating to such
Transfer Taxes. Sellers and Purchaser will consult and cooperate in timely
preparing and making all filings, Tax Returns, reports and forms as may be
required to comply with the provisions of the Laws relating to such Transfer
Taxes and will cooperate and otherwise take commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any available refunds for or exemptions from such Transfer Taxes,
including preparing exemption certificates and other instruments as are
applicable to claim available exemptions from the payment of Transfer Taxes
under applicable Law and executing and delivering such affidavits and forms as
are reasonably requested by the other party. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, any Transfer Taxes arising from
Purchasers failure to provide to Sellers valid completed exemption
certificates and other instruments, to obtain any documentation or to
complete any registration necessary to qualify for any exemption from the
imposition of, or refund or reduction of, Transfer Taxes will be borne 100% by
Purchaser.

 



-42-  10.2 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, but no later than 90
days thereafter, Purchaser will prepare and deliver to Sellers, an allocation
schedule setting forth the amounts to be allocated among Sellers and among the
Purchased Assets of each Seller, pursuant to (and to the extent necessary to
comply with) Section 1060 of the Code and the applicable regulations
promulgated thereunder (or, if applicable, any similar provision under state,
local or foreign Law or regulation) (the " _Proposed Allocation Statement_ ").
Sellers will have 20 Business Days following delivery of the Proposed
Allocation Statement during which to notify Purchaser in writing (an "
_Allocation Notice of Objection_ ") of any objections to the Proposed
Allocation Statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of
their objections. If Sellers fail to deliver an Allocation Notice of
Objection in accordance with this _Section 10.2(a)_, the Proposed Allocation
Schedule will be conclusive and binding on all parties and will become the "
_Final Allocation Statement_ ". If Sellers submit an Allocation Notice of
Objection, then for 20 Business Days after the date Purchaser receives the
Allocation Notice of Objection, Purchaser and Sellers will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the allocations. Failing such
agreement within 20 Business Days of such notice, the unresolved allocations
will be submitted to an independent, internationally-recognized accounting
firm mutually agreeable to Purchaser and Sellers, which firm will be
instructed to determine its best estimate of the allocation schedule based on
its determination of the unresolved allocations and provide a written
description of the basis for its determination within 45 Business Days after
submission, such written determination to be final, binding and conclusive.
The fees and expenses of such accounting firm will be apportioned among
Sellers and Purchaser equally.

(b) Sellers and Purchaser and their respective Affiliates will report, act,
and file Tax Returns (including, but not limited to IRS Form 8594) in all
respects and for all purposes consistent with such allocation as determined
pursuant to this _Section 10.2_. Neither Sellers nor Purchaser will take any
position (whether in audits, tax returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent
with such allocation unless required to do so by applicable Law.

10.3 _Certain Periodic Non-Income Taxes_. (a) With respect to any real or
personal property or other periodic Taxes not based on income or receipts ("
_Periodic Non-Income Taxes_ ") that are assessed on, or in respect of, the
Purchased Assets and attributable to any period that begins after the Closing
Date, if any Seller pays such Periodic Non-Income Taxes, as promptly as
practicable after delivery to Purchaser of proof of such payment, Purchaser
will pay to such Seller the amount of such Periodic Non-Income Taxes paid by
Seller. With respect to any Periodic Non-Income Taxes that are assessed on,
or in respect of, the Purchased Assets and attributable to any period that
ends on or prior to the Closing Date, if Purchaser pays such Periodic Non-
Income Taxes, as promptly as practicable after delivery to the applicable
Seller of proof of such payment, such Seller will pay to Purchaser the amount
of such Periodic Non-Income

 



-43-   Taxes paid by Purchaser, but only to the extent such amount was not taken
into account to determine any amount otherwise payable to such Seller under
any other provision of this Agreement. 

(b) With respect to any Periodic Non-Income Taxes that are assessed on, or in
respect of, the Purchased Assets and attributable to any period which
includes but does not end on the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "): (i)
if any Seller pays such Periodic Non-Income Taxes, as promptly as practicable
after delivery to Purchaser of proof of such payment, Purchaser will pay to
such Seller the amount of such Periodic Non-Income Taxes paid by such Seller
that are attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after
the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing Straddle Period_ "); and (ii) if
Purchaser pays such Periodic Non-Income Taxes, as promptly as practicable
after delivery to the applicable Seller of proof of such payment, such Seller
will pay to Purchaser the amount of such Periodic Non-Income Taxes paid by
Purchaser that are attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period up to
and including the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_ "), but
only to the extent such amount was not taken into account to determine any
amount otherwise payable to such Seller under any other provision of this
Agreement. For purposes of this _Section 10.3(b)_, the amount of Periodic
Non-Income Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Straddle Period will be
based upon the ratio of the number of days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period
to the total number of days in the Straddle Period, and the amount of Periodic
Non-Income Taxes attributable to a Post-Closing Straddle Period will be based
upon the ratio of the number of days in the Post-Closing Straddle Period to
the total number of days in the Straddle Period.

(c) The party that has the primary obligation to do so under applicable Law
will timely pay to the applicable Governmental Body any Periodic Non-Income
taxes covered by this _Section 10.3_.

 

10.4 _Cooperation and Audits_. Purchaser, its Affiliates and Sellers will
cooperate fully with each other regarding Tax matters (including the
execution of appropriate powers of attorney) and will make available to the
other as reasonably requested all information, records and documents relating
to Taxes governed by this Agreement until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations or extension thereof or the conclusion of
all audits, appeals or litigation with respect to such Taxes.

 

XI. MISCELLANEOUS

11.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The parties hereto agree
that the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement will not
survive the Closing hereunder, and none of the parties will have any
liability to each other after the Closing for any breach thereof. The parties
hereto agree that the covenants contained in this Agreement to be performed at
or after the Closing will survive the Closing hereunder, and each party
hereto will be liable to the other after the Closing for any breach thereof.

 



-44-  11.2 _Expenses_. Each of Sellers, Parent and Purchaser will bear its own
expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument contemplated by
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Without limiting the foregoing, Parent will pay the filing fee required by
Law to be paid by Parent and Purchaser in connection with the HSR Act filing
contemplated by _Section 8.4(a)_.

11.3 _Injunctive Relief_. Damages at law may be an inadequate remedy for the
breach of any of the covenants, promises and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and, accordingly, any party hereto will be entitled to injunctive
relief with respect to any such breach, including without limitation specific
performance of such covenants, promises or agreements or an order enjoining a
party from any threatened, or from the continuation of any actual, breach of
the covenants, promises or agreements contained in this Agreement. The rights
set forth in this _Section 11.3_ will be in addition to any other rights
which a party hereto may have at law or in equity pursuant to this Agreement.

11.4 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_. (a) Without
limiting any partys right to appeal any order of the Bankruptcy Court, (i)
the Bankruptcy Court will retain exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the terms
of this Agreement and to decide any claims or disputes which may arise or
result from, or be connected with, this Agreement, any breach or default
hereunder, or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) any and all
proceedings related to the foregoing will be filed and maintained only in the
Bankruptcy Court, and the parties hereby consent to and submit to the
jurisdiction and venue of the Bankruptcy Court for such purposes and will
receive notices at such locations as indicated in _Section 11.8 _hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Bankruptcy Cases have been
closed pursuant to Section 350 of the Bankruptcy Code, the parties agree to
unconditionally and irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in
New York County or the Commercial Division, Civil Branch of the Supreme Court
of the State of New York sitting in New York County and any appellate court
from any thereof, for the resolution of any such claim or dispute. The parties
hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum
for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any
party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by delivery of a
copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of  _Section 11.8_; provided,
however, that such service will not be effective until the actual receipt
thereof by the party being served.

11.5 _Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury_. Each party to this Agreement waives
any right to trial by jury in any action, matter or proceeding regarding this
Agreement or any provision hereof. 

 



-45-  11.6 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement (including
the schedules and exhibits hereto) represent the entire understanding and
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior discussions and agreements between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by
written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the
party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement,
including without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party,
will be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action
of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
of this Agreement will not operate or be construed as a further or continuing
waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No
failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right, power or remedy hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will
any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.

 

11.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts
made and performed in such State.

unless the context otherwise requires. 

11.11 _Non-Recourse_. No past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner or equityholder of the parties to this
Agreement will have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of
