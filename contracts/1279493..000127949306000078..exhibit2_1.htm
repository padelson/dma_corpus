ARTICLE  4

 

Effect  of  the Merger on Capital Stock; Exchange of Certificates

 

 

 

_Section  4.01._ ___Effect  on Capital Stock._

 

 

__ At  the  Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action
on the part  of  the holder of any capital stock of the Company or Merger
Sub:

 

 

(a) _Merger  Consideration_.  Each  share of common stock of the Company,
par value $0.01 per share (each a " **Common  Share** " and  collectively,
the " **Common  Shares** "),  issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than  Common Shares owned by Acquiror or Merger Sub
that are not held on behalf of  third parties or by the Company (each, an "
**Excluded  Share** " and  collectively, the " **Excluded  Shares** ")) 
shall  be converted into the right to receive $14.10 per Common Share in cash
(the  " **Merger  Consideration** ").  At  the Effective Time, all of the
Common Shares shall cease to be outstanding,  shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each certificate (a " **Certificate** ")  formerly
representing any of such Common Shares shall thereafter represent  only  the
right to the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof.

 

 

(b) _Cancellation  of Shares_.  Each  Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the  part  of the holder thereof, cease
to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without  payment of any consideration
therefor and shall cease to exist.

 

 

(c) _Merger  Sub_.  At the  Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger  Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be  converted into one share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the  Surviving Corporation and each
certificate formerly representing one share  of  common stock of Merger Sub
shall thereafter represent one share of common stock  of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

 

_Section  4.02._ ___Exchange  of Certificates._

 

 

(a) _Paying  Agent_.  As of  the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited,  with  an exchange agent selected by Acquiror
(and reasonably acceptable to the  Company) (the " **Paying  Agent** "), 
as  and when needed for the benefit of the holders of Common Shares, cash
amounts  in  immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to
make all required  payments under Section  4.01(a)  (such  cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " **Exchange  Fund** ").  The  Paying Agent
shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Acquiror,  _provided_   that 
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States  of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by  Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's
Corporation,  respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or  banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1 billion. Any  interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part  of  the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under Section  4.01(a)  shall be  promptly
returned to Acquiror.

 

 

(b) _Payment  Procedures_.  Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three business days),  the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder  of  record of Common Shares (other than
the Excluded Shares) a notice advising  such  holders of the effectiveness
of the Merger, including the appropriate  transmittal materials

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifying  that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates  shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in  lieu thereof, as provided in Section  4.02(e)) 
and  instructions for surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu  thereof) to the Paying Agent, such materials to be in a form
reasonably  acceptable to Acquiror and the Company. Upon the surrender of a
Certificate  (or  affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section  4.02(e))  to the  Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of
such transmittal materials, the  holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor  a  cash amount in immediately available
funds (after giving effect to any required  tax withholdings as provided in
Section  4.02(f))  equal  to (x) the number of Common Shares represented by
such Certificate (or affidavit  of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section  4.02(e))  multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and the
Certificate so surrendered  shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount  payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates. In the event of a transfer  of  ownership of Common Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of  the  Company, any cash to
be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued  and/or paid to
such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such  Common Shares
is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents  required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any  applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid or are not  applicable.

 

 

(c) _Transfers_.  From  and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer  books of the Company of any Common Shares
that were outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

(d) _Termination  of Exchange Fund_.  Any  portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof)  that remains unclaimed
by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after  the  Effective Time
shall be delivered to Acquiror. Any holder of Common Shares  (other than
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article  4 
shall  thereafter look only to Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation for
payment  of  the Merger Consideration payable for the Common Shares of that
holder upon  due  surrender of the Certificate (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof as provided  in Section  4.02(e))  for  such Common Shares,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  none of
Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other  Person
shall be liable to any former holder of Common Shares for any amount 
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned 
property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by any
holder  of Common Shares immediately prior to such time when the amounts
would otherwise  escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity
shall become, to the  extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of
Acquiror, free and clear  of  any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. For the  purposes of this Agreement, the term "
**Person** " shall  mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit), general or limited  partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust,  association, organization, Governmental Entity (as
defined in Section  5.01(e)(i))  or  other entity of any kind or nature.

 

 

(e) _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_.  In the  event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making  of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be  lost, 
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Acquiror, the posting by 
such  Person of a bond in customary and reasonable amount and upon such terms
as  may  reasonably be required by Acquiror as indemnity against any claim
that may  be  made against it

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange
for such  lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate cash in the amount that would
be payable  or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had
such lost,  stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

 

 

(f) _Withholding  Rights_.  Each of  Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold  from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any  holder of Common Shares such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold  with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code  of  1986, as amended, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the  " **Code** ") 
and/or  any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in
Section 5.01(n))  law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation  or  Acquiror, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (i)  shall be  remitted by Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to the  applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii)  shall be 
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder 
of  Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by  the  Surviving Corporation or Acquiror, as the case may be. 

 

 

_Section  4.03._ ___Appraisal  Rights._

 

 

__ In  accordance with Section 3-202(c)(1) of the MGCL, no appraisal rights
shall  be  available to holders of Common Shares in connection with the 
Merger.

 

 

_Section  4.04._ ___Adjustments._

 

 

__ Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between
the date of this  Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and
outstanding Common Shares  or  securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for Common Shares  shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class  by reason of any reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock  split), stock dividend or stock
distribution, recapitalization, redenomination,  merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, then  the  Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted and as so adjusted shall,  from 
and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration.

 

 

_Section  4.05._ ___Company  Awards._

 

 

(a) At  the  Effective Time, each Company Option (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall  not include any option to purchase Common Shares under the
ESPP), whether vested  or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall  be canceled as of the Effective Time (each such
Company Option that is so  canceled, a " **Cash-Out  Option** ",  and  the
Surviving Corporation shall pay each holder of such Cash-Out Option at  or 
promptly after the Effective Time for each such Cash-Out Option an amount in 
cash (less any applicable withholding or deductions) equal to the product of 
(i)  the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable
exercise  price per Common Share of such Cash-Out Option multiplied by (ii)
the number  of  Common Shares such holder could have purchased (assuming
full vesting of such  Cash-Out Option) had such holder exercised such Cash-
Out Option in full  immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

(b) At  the  Effective Time, each restricted Common Share and any restricted
unit  representing a Common Share (such restricted Common Shares and
restricted units  representing Common Shares, " **Restricted  Shares** ")

**Cash-Out  Share** "),  the  Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding or  deductions).

 

 

(c) As  soon  as reasonably practicable following the date hereof and, in
any event, at least  3 weeks prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
prepare and deliver  to  Acquiror an initial list of (i) each outstanding
Company Option (which, for  the  avoidance of doubt, shall not include any
option to purchase Common Shares  under  the ESPP), including the holder,
date of grant, exercise price, vesting schedule  and number of Common Shares
subject thereto and (ii) each outstanding grant  of  Restricted Shares
granted under a Stock Plan, including the holder, date of  grant, vesting

revised from time to time prior to the Effective Time. Upon the  reasonable
request of Acquiror, the Company shall provide Acquiror with all  information
as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to verify such list  and, 
should Acquiror question any portion of such list, the parties agree to 
cooperate in good faith to resolve any such question. Acquiror shall verify 
to  the Company such list no later than the business day immediately
preceding  the  Closing Date. The parties agree that such list, as may be
revised from time  to  time and as so verified by Acquiror, shall be binding
upon all Persons  (including the affected participants in the applicable
Stock Plans) as to the  treatment of all Company Options and restricted or
performance-based Common  Shares granted under a Stock Plan outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective  Time.

4.05.

 

 

(b) Prior  to  the Closing Date the Company will, to the extent reasonably
necessary to  effectuate Section  4.05,  obtain  the consent of all
holders of Cash-Out Options and Cash-Out Shares.

Second Quarter 10-Q** "),  a  copy of which is attached to the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company hereby  represents and warrants to Acquiror
and Merger Sub as follows:

 

 

(a) _Organization,  Good Standing and Qualification_.  Each of  the Company
and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly  existing and
in good standing under the Laws (as defined in Section  5.01(k))  of its 
respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or 
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets  and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified,
licensed  or admitted to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation  in  each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation
of its assets or  properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, license  or  admission, except where the failure to be so
qualified, licensed or admitted,  or  to have such power or authority, would
not, individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined  below). Subject to Section 
2.01,  the  Company has made available to Acquiror complete and correct
copies of the  Company Charter and the Company Bylaws, each as amended to the
date hereof,  and  each as so delivered is in full force and effect. As used
in this Agreement,  the  term (i) " **Subsidiary** " means,  with respect
to any Person, any other Person of which at least a majority of  the 
securities or ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting
power  to  elect a majority of the board of directors or other persons
performing similar  functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled
by such Person or by  one  or more of its Subsidiaries and (ii) "
**Company  Material Adverse Effect** " means  a  material adverse effect
on (x) the assets, condition (financial or otherwise),  business or results
of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken  as  a whole or (y)
the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions  contemplated by,
or to perform its obligations under, this Agreement prior  to  the
Termination Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  none of the following,
in and of itself or themselves, shall be considered  in  determining whether
a Company Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred under  clause (x) of
this definition:

 

 

(i) changes  in the economy or financial markets, including, without
limitation, prevailing  interest rates and market conditions, generally in
the United States or that  are  the result of acts of war or terrorism,
except to the extent any of the same  materially  disproportionately 
affects the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as compared to other
companies  in  the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate;

 

 

(ii) changes  that are proximately caused by factors generally affecting the
industry in  which  the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, except to the
extent any of the same  materially disproportionately affects the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; 

 

 

(iii) any  loss  of, or adverse change in, the relationship of the Company
with its customers,  employees or suppliers proximately caused by the
announcement of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

materially  disproportionately affects the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
as compared  to  other companies in the industry in which the Company and
its Subsidiaries  operate;

 

 

(vi)  any  failure by the Company to meet any estimates of revenues or
earnings for any  period ending on or after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Closing;  _provided_   that the  exception in this clause
shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination  that any change,
effect, circumstance or development underlying such failure  or  that such
reduced revenues or earnings constitutes, has resulted in, or  contributed
to, a Company Material Adverse Effect; and

 

 

(vii) a  decline  in the stock price of the Company Common Stock on the
NYSE; _provided_   that the  exception in this clause shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination  that any change, effect, circumstance or
development underlying such decline  constitutes, has resulted in, or
contributed to, a Company Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

(b) _Charter. _ The  Company has adopted resolutions necessary to exempt, as
of the Effective Time,  Acquiror, Merger Sub and each of their respective
affiliates from the Ownership  Limit (as defined in the Company Charter) set
forth in Article XI of the Company  Charter, and such resolutions are in full
force and effect on the date of this  Agreement.

other securities of each of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly authorized, 
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by 
a  direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear
of  any  mortgage, lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim, or
encumbrance (a  " **Lien** ").  No  Company Subsidiary owns any Shares.

 

 

(ii) The  Company has no Shares reserved for issuance, except that, as of

(other than under the ESPP) as well  as  each Restricted Share, including

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Common  Shares and Restricted Shares in accordance with the terms of the 2001
Plan,  the  ESPP or the Company Options, such Common Shares will be duly
authorized, validly  issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

 

 

(iii) Except  as  set forth in clause (i)  above,  (A) there are no
preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants,  conversion
rights, stock appreciation rights, phantom equity rights, redemption  rights,
repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or  other 
securities rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other
securities  of  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or
obligations  convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving
any Person a  right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the
Company or any of  its  Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights are  authorized, issued or outstanding and (B) the
Company does not have outstanding  any bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have  the  right to vote (or convertible
into or exercisable for securities having the  right to vote) with the
stockholders of the Company on any matter.

 

 

(iv) Section  5.01(c)(iv) of  the  Company Disclosure Letter sets forth as
of August 8, 2006, (x) each of the  Company's Subsidiaries and the ownership
interest of the Company in each such  Subsidiary, as well as the ownership
interest of any other Person or Persons  in  each such Subsidiary and (y)
the Company's or its Subsidiaries' capital stock,  equity interest or other
direct or indirect ownership interest in any other  Person, other than
securities in a publicly traded company held for investment  consisting of
less than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of such Person.  The  Company
does not own, directly or indirectly, any voting interest in any Person 
that, to the Knowledge of the Company, requires an additional filing by
Acquiror  under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended,  and  the rules and regulations promulgated thereby (the " **HSR 
Act** ").

 

 

(d) _Corporate  Authority; Approval and Fairness_. 

 

 

(i) The  Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has
taken all  corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and
perform its  obligations under this Agreement subject only to approval of the
Merger and  the  Charter Amendment by the affirmative vote of the holders of
two-thirds of the  outstanding Common Shares entitled to vote on such matters
at a stockholders' meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the "
**Requisite  Company Vote** "),  and  to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. This  Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes  a  valid and binding
agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company  in  accordance
with its terms, subject, in the case of enforceability, to  bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and  similar laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights  and to
general equity principles (the " **Bankruptcy  and Equity Exception** ").

 

 

(ii) The  board  of directors of the Company has (A) unanimously  approved
and declared advisable the Merger, the Charter Amendment and the other

2004 (the " **Applicable  Date** ")  (the  Exchange Act Reports and the

the Registration  Statements at the time such Registration Statement became
effective as  determined under Rule 159 under the Securities Act (in each
case, the " **Relevant  Time** "),  complied, or if not yet filed or
furnished, will comply at the Relevant Time,  in  all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act,  the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " **Sarbanes-Oxley  Act** "),  as  the case
may be, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable  to
the Company Reports. As of the Relevant Time, the Company Reports did not, 
and any Company Reports filed or furnished with the SEC subsequent to the
date  hereof and prior to the Closing Date will not, contain any untrue
statement  of a  material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein  or  necessary to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances  in  which they were made, not misleading. 

 

 

(ii) The  Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable listing  and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
NYSE. Except as permitted  by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2)

the Company and there are no outstanding  loans or other extensions of credit
to any executive officers or directors  of  the Company or any of its

(iii) The  Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15  or  15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are  designed to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be  disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange  Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods  specified in the SEC's rules and forms and to
provide reasonable assurance that  such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management,  including the Company's chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, as  appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company  maintains
internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15  or 
15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act. Such internal control over 
financial reporting

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of  financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external  purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles  (" **GAAP** ")  and  includes policies and procedures that (A)
pertain  to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly  reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company, (B) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit  preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, and that receipts  and expenditures of the Company are being made only
in accordance with  authorizations of management and directors of the
Company, and (C) provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized  acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's
assets that could have a  material effect on its financial statements. The
Company has disclosed, based  on  the most recent evaluation performed by or
under the management of its chief  executive officer and its chief financial
officer prior to the date hereof,  to  the Company's auditors and the audit
committee of the Company's board of  directors (A) any significant
deficiencies known to the Company in the design  or  operation of its
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably  likely to
adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize  and
report financial information and has identified for the Company's auditors 
and audit committee of the Company's board of directors any material
weaknesses  in internal control over financial reporting known to the Company
and (B) any  fraud known to the Company, whether or not material, that
involves management  or  other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal control  over financial reporting. Since the Applicable
Date, no material complaints  from  any source regarding accounting,
internal accounting controls or auditing  matters, and no concerns from
Company employees regarding questionable  accounting or auditing matters,
have been received by the Company. No attorney  representing the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed  by  the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation  of  securities laws,
breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company  or  any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Company's chief legal 
officer, audit committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) of 
the  board of directors or the board of directors pursuant to the rules
adopted  pursuant to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Company
policy  contemplating such reporting, including in instances not required by
those  rules. 

 

 

(iv) Each  of  the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated
by reference into  the Company Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents,  or, in the case of Company Reports filed after
the date hereof and prior to  the  Closing Date, will fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated  financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of its  date and each of the consolidated
statements of operations, changes in  shareholders' equity (deficit) and cash
flows included in or incorporated by  reference into the Company Reports
(including any related notes and schedules)  fairly presents, or in the case
of Company Reports filed after the date hereof  and prior to the Closing
Date, will fairly present in all material respects  the  results of
operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial  position, as
the case may be, of such companies for the periods set forth  therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal  year-end
audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect),  in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

each  case  in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except  as may be noted therein.

the date hereof, the Company and its Subsidiaries  have conducted their

former officer, director  or  employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who has made a claim, or  has  notified the Company in writing

reasonably expected to result in material  liability to the Company or any
Subsidiary, or (B) that would be reasonably  expected to have a material
adverse effect on the ability of the Company to  consummate the transactions
contemplated by, or to perform its obligations  under, this Agreement prior
to the Termination Date. Neither the Company nor  any  of its Subsidiaries
is a party to or subject to the provisions of any judgment,  order, writ,
injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Entity which would, 
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company

(i) _No  Undisclosed Material Liabilities._ There  are  no liabilities or
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of  any  kind

circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in such a

disclosed and provided  for  in the Company Reports filed prior to the date
hereof or in the Draft Second  Quarter 10-Q or in the financial statements of
the Company and its Subsidiaries  contained or incorporated by reference
therein, and (ii) working capital  liabilities or obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business  consistent with past practices since the Company
Balance Sheet Date and (iii)  any other liabilities that would not reasonably
be expected to have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(j) _Employee  Matters_. 

 

 

(i) All  material benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or
arrangements  covering current or former employees of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and its  predecessors (to the extent any obligations thereunder
have been assumed by  the  Company and the Company continues to have
liability thereunder), current or  former directors of the Company,
including, but not limited to, "employee  benefit plans" within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement  Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" **ERISA** ")  (whether or not subject thereto), deferred
compensation, severance, termination  pay, retirement, stock option, stock
purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock  based, incentive and bonus
agreement or arrangement, and any employment,  retention or consultancy
agreement or arrangement with any officer or other  key  employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " **Company  Benefit Plans**
")  as of  August 8, 2006 are listed on Section  5.01(j)(i)  of the 
Company Disclosure Letter. True and complete copies of the Company Benefit 
Plans  (together with any amendment thereto, any related trust or other
funding  document relating thereto, any summary plan description or
prospectus prepared  in connection therewith and, if applicable, the most
recent annual report (Form  5500 including, if applicable Schedule B thereto)
and tax return (Form 990)  prepared in connection therewith) have been made
available to Acquiror. Neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or
has ever been party to any  collective bargaining agreement or similar labor
agreement, any "multiemployer  plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA or any defined benefit  pension plan (including any benefit plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA, Part  3 of  Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code). Neither the Company  nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any joint, several or contingent liability  related to or arising under
any benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA  (including any multiemployer
plan).

 

 

(ii) As  applicable, all Company Benefit Plans are in compliance with ERISA,
the Code  and  other applicable Laws, except for such failures to comply as
would  not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Company  Material Adverse Effect.  No  Company Benefit Plan is reasonably
expected to cause any participant therein  to  incur material additional
taxes or interest under Section 409A of the Code  or  any regulations or
Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder. Each Company  Benefit Plan which is
subject to ERISA (a " **Company  ERISA Plan** ")  that  is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received  a  favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the " **IRS** "), 
and  the Company is not aware of any circumstances that exist that would
reasonably  be expected to result in the loss of the qualification of such
Company ERISA  Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code that could not be
remedied in a manner  that would not result in material liability to the
Company. True and complete  copies of the most recent determination letter
relating to each such Company  ERISA Plan have been made available to
Acquiror. Neither the Company nor any  of  its Subsidiaries has, with
respect to any Company ERISA Plan, engaged in a  transaction prohibited under
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA  that would reasonably be
expected to subject the Company or any Subsidiary  to a  liability, tax or
penalty under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of  ERISA, except for
such liabilities, taxes or penalties as would not,  individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company  Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) All  contributions required to be made under each Company Benefit Plan,
as of the  date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in respect
of each  Company Benefit Plan have been accrued in accordance with GAAP and
reflected  in  the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or
incorporated by reference  in  the Company Reports prior to the date hereof,
except as would not reasonably  be  expected to result in a material
liability to the Company.

 

 

(iv) As  of the  date hereof, there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company,  threatened, litigation relating to the Company Benefit Plans,
except for any  litigation that, individually or in the aggregate, if decided
adversely to  the  Company or any Subsidiary, would not be reasonably
expected to result in  material liability to the Company or any Subsidiary.
Neither the Company nor  any  of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health, life or other  welfare benefits. The Company or its
Subsidiaries may merge, amend, suspend  or  terminate any Company Benefit
Plan at any time without incurring any material  liability thereunder other
than in respect of benefits accrued prior to such  merger, amendment,
suspension or termination.

 

 

(v) Except  as  expressly contemplated by this Agreement, none of the
execution of this  Agreement by the Company, approval of the Merger by the
stockholders of the  Company or the consummation by the Company of the other
transactions  contemplated hereby (whether alone or in combination with other
events) will  (w)  entitle any current or former employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries,  to  severance or termination pay or any increase in
severance or termination pay  upon any termination of employment after the
date hereof in excess of $25,000  per individual or $150,000 in the
aggregate, (x) accelerate the time of payment  or vesting or result in any
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or  otherwise) of compensation or
benefits under, increase the amount payable or  result in any other material
obligation pursuant to, any of the Company Benefit  Plans, (y) limit or
restrict the right of the Company to merge, amend, suspend  or terminate any
of the Company Benefit Plans or (z) result in payments under  any of the
Company Benefit Plans which would not be deductible under Section  280G of
the Code.

 

 

(vi) All  current employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries ("
**Employees** ")are  employed in the United States. To the Knowledge of the
Company, no key employee  or independent contractor of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has indicated  to  the Company or its Subsidiaries that he or
she intends to resign or retire  as a  result of the transactions
contemplated hereby as of the date hereof or  otherwise within one year after
the Closing Date. The Company and its  Subsidiaries have complied in the past
three (3) years, in all material respects  with all material Laws relating to
labor and employment, including those  relating to wages, hours, overtime,
collective bargaining, unemployment  compensation, worker's compensation,
equal employment opportunity, age and  disability discrimination, immigration
control, employee classification,  information privacy and security, payment
and withholding of taxes and  continuation coverage with respect to group
health plans. Neither the Company  nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a
party to or subject to, or is currently  negotiating in connection with
entering into, any collective bargaining  agreement or other labor agreement
with any union or labor organization, and,  to  the Company's Knowledge,
there has not been any activity or proceeding of any  labor organization or
employee group to organize any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees  in the past two (2) years. Since March 31, 2006, neither the
Company nor  any of its Subsidiaries has effectuated (A) a  "plant closing"
(as defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification  Act ("
**WARN  Act** "))  affecting any site of employment or one or more
facilities or operating units  within any site of employment or facility of
the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries; (B) a  "mass layoff" (as defined in
the WARN Act); or (C) such  other transaction, layoff, reduction in force or
employment terminations  sufficient in number to trigger application of any
similar Law in each case  that  would reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

(k) _Compliance  with Laws_.  The  businesses of each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries have been in the past  three (3) years, and are being,
conducted in compliance in all material respects  with all material federal,
state, local or foreign laws, statutes or ordinances,  common law and all
rules, regulations, judgments, orders, writs, injunctions,  and decrees of
any Governmental Entity applicable to the businesses of the  Company and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, " **Laws** "),  except with respect to Laws
pertaining to the origination, mortgage lending  and  servicing activities
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that relate to an  immaterial portion of
the Company's assets on a consolidated basis. To the  Knowledge of the
Company, and except for ordinary regulatory examinations  relating to the
origination, mortgage lending and servicing activities of the  Company and
its Subsidiaries, no investigation by any Governmental Entity with  respect
to the Company and its Subsidiaries is pending or threatened. The  Company
and its Subsidiaries each has obtained and is in compliance, in all  material
respects, with all material licenses, permits, certifications,  approvals,
registrations, consents, authorizations, franchises, variances,  exemptions
and orders issued or granted by a Governmental Entity (" **Licenses** ") 
necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted. None of the assets 
of  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries constitute "plan assets" within
the  meaning of Labor Regulations § 2510.3-101.  Neither  the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries, and none of their directors, officers,  employees or
independent contractors, has, in connection with the performance  of  its
duties and obligations to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), been  a

857(b), 860(c)  or  4981 of the Code or Treasury Regulation Sections

by the Company  and its Subsidiaries in their business as presently conducted
conforms with  applicable building, subdivision and zoning laws, regulations
and permits,  except where the failure to conform would not, individually or

that in  no event shall the Company or any Subsidiary take any of the
foregoing actions  for the benefit of any participant in the Company\'s 2005

Subsidiaries, whether pursuant to an employment agreement, a change in 
control plan, or otherwise, to the extent that such payment or vesting
occurs  as  a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
amount of  any  such dividend or dividends shall be initially proposed by
the Company, but  shall  be subject to the mutual agreement of the Company
and Acquiror, _provided_   that the  Company and Acquiror (and their
authorized representatives) agree to consult  in  good faith with respect to
the determination of the amount of such dividend  or  dividends, and shall
use their commercially reasonable best efforts to agree  on  such amount as
quickly as is practicable. Any dividends declared pursuant to  this Section

minimum  distribution requirement of Section 857(a) with respect to such
taxable year  (the **" 2005  Throwback Amount"**),  _provided_   that
the  Company and Acquiror (and their authorized representatives) shall
consult in  good faith with respect to the determination of the 2005
Throwback Amount,  and  the Company\'s determination of the 2005 Throwback
Amount shall be subject to  the  written approval of Acquiror (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld  or delayed).

 

 

(c) Acquiror  covenants and agrees that, after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective  Time  or earlier termination of this Agreement (unless the
Company shall otherwise  approve in writing (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or  delayed), and except as otherwise expressly
contemplated by this Agreement  or as  required by applicable Law), it will
not and will not permit any of its  Subsidiaries to take any action or omit
to take any action that would reasonably  be expected to result in any of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article  7  not  being satisfied.

 

 

(d) Nothing  in this Section  6.01  shall be  construed to limit the
ability of Acquiror or its Affiliates from causing the  Company to seek a
"closing agreement" within the meaning of Section 7121 of the  Code if it is
reasonably determined that the Company or a Subsidiary of the  Company
engaged in any action or failed to take any action that was likely  to 
adversely affect the status of the Company as a REIT prior to the Effective 
Time.

 

 

_Section  6.02._ ___Acquisition  Proposals._

 

 

(a) _No  Solicitation or Negotiation_.  The  Company agrees that, except as
expressly permitted by this Section  6.02,  neither  it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers and  directors shall, and
that it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees,  investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives  (such
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants 
and other advisors or representatives, collectively, " **Representatives**
")  not  to, directly or indirectly:

 

 

(i) initiate,  solicit or encourage any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer that  constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition  Proposal (as defined below);

 

 

(ii) engage  in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations  regarding, or provide any non-public information or data of the

or attempt to make  an Acquisition Proposal; or

to in Section  7.01(a), (A) provide

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

information  in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an
unsolicited  _bona  fide_   written  Acquisition Proposal if the Company
receives from the Person so requesting  such  information an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms not materially less  restrictive to the
other party than those contained in the Confidentiality  Agreement (as
defined in Section  9.07)  and  reasonably promptly discloses any such
information to Acquiror to the extent  not  previously provided to Acquiror;
or (B) engage  or participate in discussions or negotiations with any Person
who has made  such  an unsolicited _bona  fide_   written  Acquisition
Proposal, in each case if and only to the extent that, (x) prior  to  taking
any action described in clause (A) or (B) above, the board of directors  of
the Company determines in good faith after consultation with outside counsel 
that the failure to take such action would likely be inconsistent with the 
directors' fiduciary duties to the Company or its stockholders under
applicable  Law, and (y) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B)
above, the  board  of directors of the Company has determined in good faith
based on the  information then available and after consultation with its
financial advisor  that such Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be
expected to result in or  lead  to a Superior Proposal.

 

 

(b) _Definitions_.  For  purposes of this Agreement:

 

 

" **Acquisition  Proposal** " means  (i) any inquiry, proposal, offer or
indication of interest with respect to  a  merger, joint venture,
partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,  tender offer,
recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business  combination,
acquisition or similar transaction involving the Company or any  of  its
Significant Subsidiaries and (ii) any acquisition in any manner, directly 
or  indirectly, of 20% or more of the total voting power or of any class of
equity  securities of the Company, or those of any of its Significant
Subsidiaries,  or  20% or more of the consolidated total assets (including
equity securities of  its  Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other
than the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, " **Significant  Subsidiary** " is  as  defined in Rule 1.02(w)
of Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to the Exchange  Act.

 

 

" **Superior  Proposal** " means  an unsolicited, _bona  fide_  
written  Acquisition Proposal involving more than 50% of the assets (on a
consolidated  basis) or total voting power of the equity securities of the
Company that its  board of directors has determined in its good faith
judgment would reasonably  be  expected to be consummated and, if
consummated, would result in a transaction  more favorable to the Company's
stockholders from a financial point of view than  the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account (i)  any revisions
to the terms of the transaction contemplated by Section  6.02(c)  of this 
Agreement, (ii) all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, 
including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to 
consummation, and likelihood of consummation (iii) the advice of its counsel 
and  its investment banker of nationally recognized reputation and (iv) if
a  cash transaction, the likelihood of obtaining any required financing). 

 

 

(c) _No  Change in Recommendation_.  The  board of directors of the Company
and each committee thereof shall not take  any  of the following actions
(each of the matters referred to in clause (i) or  (ii)  below, a "
**Change  of Recommendation** "):

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) withhold,  withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold,  withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Acquiror, the
Company  Recommendation with respect to the Merger;

 

 

(ii) approve,  recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to
approve, recommend  or  declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) an
Acquisition Proposal;  or

 

 

(iii) except  as  permitted by, and after compliance with, Section 8.03(b)
hereof, cause or permit  the Company to enter into a definitive agreement
(other than a confidentiality  agreement referred to in Section  6.02(a)) 
relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an " **Alternative  Acquisition
Agreement** ").

 

 

Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement the
board of directors  of  the Company may, prior to, but not after, the
approval of the Company's  stockholders referred to in Section 7.01(a),
effect a Change of Recommendation  or enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement if (A)  it has  received a Superior Proposal, (B)  the  board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation  with
counsel, that taking such action is required by its fiduciary duties to 
the  Company or its stockholders under applicable Law, and (C) the  Company
notifies Acquiror, in writing at least five (5) Business Days before  taking
that action, of its intention to do so in response to a Superior Proposal 
and attaching the most current version of any proposed agreement or a
reasonably  detailed summary of all material terms of any such proposal and
the identity  of  the offeror, and (D) Acquiror  does not make, within five
(5) Business Days after its receipt of that written  notification, an offer
that that the board of directors of the Company  determines, in good faith
after consultation with its financial advisors, is  at  least as favorable
to the stockholders of the Company as the Superior Proposal.  In determining
whether to make a Change of Recommendation or enter into an  Alternative
Acquisition Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal or  otherwise, the
Company's board of directors shall take into account any changes  to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Acquiror. Any material amendment  to 
any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for 
purposes of this Section  6.02.  In the  event that the Company complies
with its obligations in the preceding sentence,  the Company may enter into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, but not prior  to such time as the
Company has provided Acquiror with written notice that  the  Company has
elected to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections  8.03(b)  and 
otherwise complies with the Company's obligations under this Section  6.02, 
Section  8.03(b)  and  Section 8.05(b).

 

 

(d) _Certain  Permitted Disclosure_.  Nothing  contained herein shall
prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from  complying with its
disclosure obligations under applicable Law, provided that  if  such
disclosure includes or constitutes a Change of Recommendation, the Company 
shall be required to comply with Section 6.02(c) before making any such 
disclosure.

 

 

(e) _Existing  Discussions_.  The  Company agrees that it will (i)
immediately  cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or  negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any  Acquisition Proposal and (ii) request  any such party (or
its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential  information about the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished  by  or on behalf of
the Company or its Subsidiaries to return or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

destroy  all such information (and all analyses, reports and other documents
or  communications that analyze or incorporate such information) (and certify
such  return or destruction).

 

 

(f) _Notice_.  The  Company agrees that it will as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and, in  any  event, within 24 hours ) notify Acquiror (which
notification may be by telephone  or email to a principal of Acquiror,
provided that such notice is followed  up  within 24 hours thereafter by
notice in the manner set forth in Section 9.06)  if  any Acquisition
Proposal is received by it or any of its Representatives  indicating, in
connection with such notice, the material terms and conditions  of  any
proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written 
requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter 
shall keep Acquiror informed as promptly as reasonably practicable of the
status  and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments
thereto)  and  the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including
any change in  the  Company's intentions as previously notified.

 

 

_Section  6.03._ ___Proxy  Statement._

 

 

__ The  Company shall prepare and file with the SEC as promptly as
reasonably  practicable a proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the
Company  Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section  6.04)  (such  proxy
statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the " **Proxy 
Statement** ").  The  Company agrees, as to it and its Subsidiaries, that
the Proxy Statement will  comply in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Exchange  Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Each of the Company and Acquiror  agrees, as to itself and its respective
Subsidiaries and affiliates, that none  of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries  or affiliates for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement  will, on the date the
Proxy Statement is first mailed to holders of the Shares  or at the time of
the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement  of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated  therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Acquiror and
Merger  Sub shall, and shall cause their affiliates to, cooperate with and
provide  reasonable assistance to the Company in connection with the
preparation, filing  and mailing of the Proxy Statement. Subject to
Acquiror's and Merger Sub's  compliance with the preceding sentence and
Section  6.05,  the  Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to have cleared by the  SEC  and thereafter mail to its stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable  the Proxy Statement and all other proxy
materials for such meeting.

 

 

_Section  6.04._ ___Stockholders  Meeting._

 

 

__ Unless  this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with the terms
hereof, and  subject to Section 6.02 of this Agreement, the Company will
take, in accordance  with applicable Law and the Company Charter and the
Company Bylaws, all action  necessary to convene a meeting of holders of
Shares (the " **Company  Stockholders Meeting** ")  as  promptly as
reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement and  the 
filing of the definitive Proxy Statement to consider and vote upon the
approval  of the Merger and to cause such vote to be taken. Subject to
Section  6.02  hereof,  the Company's board of directors shall recommend
such approval and shall use all  commercially reasonable efforts to solicit
such approval.

  (a) The  Company and Acquiror each shall, upon request by the other,
furnish the other  with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers  and stockholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or  advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or
any other statement, filing,  notice or application made by or on behalf of
Acquiror, the Company or any  of  their respective Subsidiaries to any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity  in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

(b) Subject  to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Company and  Acquiror shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall
cause their  respective Subsidiaries to use) all of their respective
commercially reasonable  efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions,
and do or cause to be done  all  things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under this  Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective the Merger and  the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as soon as reasonably  practicable, including preparing and
filing as promptly as reasonably  practicable all documentation to effect all
necessary notices, reports and  other  filings and to obtain as promptly as
reasonably practicable all consents,  registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations necessary or advisable  to  be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to  consummate the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this  Agreement; _provided_   that
the  parties hereto understand and agree that all commercially reasonable
efforts  of  any party hereto shall not be deemed to include (i) entering
into any  settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement
with any  Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby  or  (ii) divesting or otherwise holding separate
(including by establishing a  trust or otherwise), or taking any other action
(or otherwise agreeing to do  any  of the foregoing) with respect to any of
its or the Surviving Corporation's  Subsidiaries or any of their respective
affiliates' businesses, assets or  properties. The Company and Acquiror will
each request early termination of  the  waiting period with respect to the
Merger under the HSR Act. Subject to  applicable Law relating to the exchange
of information, Acquiror and the Company  shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each  will consult with the other on
and consider in good faith the views of the  other  in connection with, all
of the information relating to Acquiror or the Company,  as the case may be,
and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears  in  any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or  any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Proxy Statement). In
exercising  the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Acquiror shall act
reasonably  and  as promptly as practicable.

 

 

(c) Subject  to applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, the Company  and Acquiror each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters  relating to completion of the transactions contemplated,
including as promptly  as reasonably practicable furnishing the other with
copies of notices or other  communications received by Acquiror or the
Company, as the case may be, or  any  of its Subsidiaries, from any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity with  respect to such transactions. The
Company and Acquiror each shall give  reasonably prompt notice to the other
of any change that would reasonably be  expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or have a material adverse  effect on the ability of Acquiror
or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions  contemplated by, or to perform
its obligations under, this Agreement prior  to  the Termination Date or of
any failure to the other party's conditions to effect  the Merger.

_Section   6.06._ _Access._

 

 

__ Subject  to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and
shall cause  its Subsidiaries to) afford Acquiror's Representatives
reasonable access, during  normal business hours throughout the period prior
to the Effective Time, to  its  employees, properties, books, contracts and
records and, during such period,  the  Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) furnish reasonably promptly  to Acquiror all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel,  and access to all
personnel, advisers, accountants and accountants' work papers,  as may
reasonably be requested, provided that no investigation pursuant to 
this Section  6.06  shall  affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company  herein provided, further,
that the foregoing shall not require the Company  (i)  to permit any
inspection or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable  judgment
of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets  of 
third parties or (ii) to disclose any privileged information of the Company 
or  any of its Subsidiaries. All such information shall be governed by the
terms  of  the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 

_Section  6.07._ ___Publicity._

 

 

(a) The  initial press releases regarding the Merger of Acquiror's parent and
of the  Company are acceptable to the other such party. On and after the date
hereof,  the Company and Acquiror each shall consult with each other prior to
issuing  any  press releases or otherwise making public announcements with
respect to the  Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and prior  to  making any filings with any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity  (including any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service)  with respect thereto, except as may be
required by Law or by obligations  pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities  exchange or interdealer quotation service
or by the request of any Governmental  Entity.

 

 

(b) Acquiror  and the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to establish  a  mutually acceptable process intended to ensure that before
any Merger  Communication of Acquiror, the Company or any of their respective
"participants" (as defined in Item 4 of Schedule 14A of the Exchange Act) is
(i) disseminated  to any investor, analyst, member of the media, employee,
client, customer or  other third party or otherwise made accessible on the
website of Acquiror,  the  Company or any such participant, as applicable
(whether in written, video or  oral form via webcast, hyperlink or
otherwise), or (ii) utilized by any officer,  senior manager, key employee or
advisor of Acquiror, the Company or any such  participant, as applicable, as
a script in discussions or meetings with any  such  third parties, the other
party and its counsel have a reasonable opportunity  to  review any such
Merger Communication for purposes of, among other things,  determining
whether that communication constitutes "soliciting material" that is 
required to be filed by Rule 14a-6(b) or Rule 14a-12(b) of the Exchange Act, 
as  applicable. As part of any such process, Acquiror and Merger Subsidiary
or  the  Company, as applicable, shall (or shall use commercially reasonable
efforts  to  cause any such participant to) give reasonable and good faith
consideration  to  any comments made by the other such party or parties and
their counsel on any  such Merger Communication. For purposes of the
foregoing, the term " **Merger  Communication** " shall  mean, with respect
to any Person, any document or other written communication  prepared by or on
behalf of that Person, or any document or other material  or  information
posted or made accessible on the website of that Person (whether  in 
written, video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise), that is 
related to any of the transactions

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemplated  by this Agreement and, if reviewed by a holder of the Company
Stock, would  reasonably be deemed to constitute a "solicitation" of
"proxies" (in each case,  as defined in Rule 14a-1 of the Exchange Act) in
favor of the  Merger.

 

 

_Section  6.08._ _Employee  Matters._

 

 

(a) To  the  extent that the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
are covered under  an employee benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation or 
Acquiror immediately following the Effective Time, such employees shall be 
credited with their years of service for eligibility and vesting purposes
(but  not for benefit accrual, eligibility for retiree medical benefits,
eligibility  or vesting for any equity compensation plan or other purposes)
credited  under any corresponding type of plan immediately prior to the
Effective  Time, except to the extent that any such crediting of service
would result  in a  duplication of benefits. For the year in which the
Effective Time  occurs, if employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
covered under  Acquiror's group health plan, (i) Acquiror shall cause all
pre-existing  condition exclusions of such Acquiror plan to be waived for
such employees  and  their covered dependents to the extent such pre-
existing condition exclusions  were inapplicable to or had been satisfied by
such employees and their covered  dependents immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the  corresponding plan of the Company or a Subsidiary;
and (ii) Acquiror shall  give full credit for deductibles satisfied under
the  corresponding plan of the Company or a Subsidiary toward any 
deductibles under such Acquiror plan in which such employees participate for 
the  remainder of the plan year during which the Closing occurs. Nothing in 
this Section 6.08(a) shall (x) require that Acquiror cover the employees of 
the  Company and its Subsidiaries under Acquiror\'s employee benefit plans or
that  any  particular employee benefit plans be provided to such employees
or (y) limit  the  Surviving Corporation\'s ability to amend or terminate
any benefit plan or  arrangement at any time.

 

 

(b) Without  limiting the generality of Section  9.08,  nothing  in this
Section  6.08,  express  or implied, is intended to confer any rights or
remedies under this Agreement  upon any Person, including any Employee, other
than the parties hereto, and  no  Person shall be entitled to enforce or
seek to enforce all or any portion of  this Section  6.08  other  than the
parties hereto.

 

 

_Section  6.09._ ___Expenses._ __ The  Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of  the  Paying Agent, in connection
with the transactions contemplated in Article  4,  and  Acquiror shall
reimburse the Surviving Corporation for such charges and  expenses. Except as

indemnify  and  hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law (and the  Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest  extent permitted under applicable Law and without
requiring a preliminary  determination as to the ultimate entitlement to

an undertaking to repay such  advances if it is ultimately determined that
such Person is not entitled to  indemnification), each present and former
director and officer of the Company  or  any of its

Subsidiaries  (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (the "
**Indemnified  Parties** "),  against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments,  fines, settlements, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (collectively, " **Costs** ")  incurred in connection
with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit  or  proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising  out of
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether 
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Prior  to  the Effective Time, subject to the proviso at the end of the
penultimate  sentence of this Section  6.10(b),  the  Company shall and if
the Company is unable to, Acquiror shall cause the  Surviving Corporation as
of the Effective Time to obtain and fully pay for  non-cancellable "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least six  years from and after
the Effective Time from one or more insurance carriers  with  the same or
better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carriers  with
respect to (1) directors' and officers' liability insurance and  fiduciary
liability insurance, with benefits and levels of coverage at least  as 
favorable as the Company's existing policies (collectively, " **D andO 
Insurance**"),  and  (2) Side A insurance with respect to the current
independent directors of  the Company at least as favorable as that described
in Schedule 6.10(b) of  the  Company Disclosure Letter (" **Side  A
Insurance** "),  in  each case, to the maximum extent commercially
obtainable and with respect to  matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including  in  connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated  hereby). If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to  obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving  Corporation shall, and
Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,  continue to maintain in
effect for a period of at least six years from and  after  the Effective
Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof and Side  A Insurance
with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as  provided in
the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof or described  in
Schedule 6.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, or 
the  Surviving Corporation shall, and Acquiror shall cause the Surviving
Corporation  to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO
Insurance and the  Side A Insurance for such six-year period with benefits
and levels of coverage  at least as favorable as provided in the Company's
existing policies as of the  date hereof or described in Schedule 6.10(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter,  as the case may be, (to the maximum extent
commercially obtainable) with respect  to matters occurring at or before the
Effective Time, provided, however, that  in  no event shall Acquiror or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend  for  such DandO Insurance and
Side A Insurance policies in any one year an amount  in excess of the
percentage set forth in Schedule 6.10(b) of the Company  Disclosure Letter of
the annual premium currently paid by the Company for the  DandO Insurance; and
if the annual cost of any such insurance coverage exceeds  such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with respect to  the  applicable
insurance coverage with the greatest coverage available for a cost  not
exceeding such amount. In addition, Acquiror shall cause the Surviving 
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to include and maintain in the Surviving 
Corporation Charter and the Surviving Corporation Bylaws and the comparable 
governing instruments of each such Subsidiary for a period of six (6) years 
after the Effective Date provisions regarding the elimination of liability 
for,  and indemnification of, officers and directors and the advancement of
expenses  that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries thereof
than the  corresponding provisions contained in the Company Charter and the
Company Bylaws  and the comparable governing instruments of the Company's 
Subsidiaries.

Acquiror shall assume such obligations.  If  Acquiror or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors  or  assigns (i) shall 
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not 
be  the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or  merger or (ii) shall  transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any  individual, corporation or other entity, then,
and in each such case,  (A) provisions shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Acquiror  or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth  in  this Section  6.10  and (B)  prompt notice
thereof shall be provided to the Indemnified Parties. 

 

 

(d) The  provisions of this Section  6.10  are  intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the  Indemnified Parties.

 

 

(e) The  rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section  6.10  shall
be  in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
Company  Charter or the Company Bylaws or the comparable governing
instruments of any  of  the Company's Subsidiaries, or under any applicable
Contracts or Laws, which  rights shall survive the Effective Time and shall
continue in full force and  effect.

foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, the board of  directors of the
Company shall adopt resolutions that specify (A) the name  of  each
individual whose disposition of Shares (including Common Shares issuable 
with respect to Company Awards) is to be exempted, (B) the number of Shares

(d) The  parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to
enforce  any  provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with,  this  Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be brought in any  federal court located in the State of Delaware or
any Delaware state court,  and  each of the parties hereby irrevocably
consents to the jurisdiction of such  courts (and of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,  action or proceeding and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted  by  law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue  of any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,  action
or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an  inconvenient
forum. Each party agrees to appoint The Corporation Trust Company,  or such
other registered agent as the parties may agree upon, as agent for  service
of process in the State of Delaware. Process in any such suit, action  or 
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within 
or  without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the
foregoing,  each  party agrees that service of process on such party as
provided in Section  9.06  shall be  deemed effective service of process on
such party.

Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be  deemed representations and
warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary  as of the date of such

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

(or  covenant(s), as applicable) of the Company that is contained in this

(or covenants, as  applicable) would be readily apparent to a reasonable
person who has read that  reference and such representation(s) and
warranty(ies) (or covenant(s), as  applicable); and

 

 

(b) in  no  event shall any information whatsoever contained in any section
of any Company  Report or of the Draft Second Quarter 10-Q entitled "Risk

for purposes of) any  representation(s) and warranty(ies) of the Company that
is contained in this  Agreement; and

 

 

(c) in  no  event shall the information contained in any section of any

Re:

_Status  as a Real Estate Investment  Trust_

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

Ladies  and Gentlemen:

 

 

In  connection with the merger of [Merger Sub] with and into Angle Capital,
Inc.,  a  Maryland corporation (the "Company") pursuant to the Agreement and
Plan of  Merger dated August __, 2006 (the "Merger Agreement"), you have
requested our  opinion concerning the qualification and taxation of the
Company as a Real  Estate Investment Trust (a "REIT") under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as  amended (the "Code") pursuant to Section 7.02(c) of
the Merger  Agreement.

 

 

In  formulating our opinions, we have examined originals or copies of the
Articles  of Amendment and Restatement of the Company\'s charter dated June
2, 2004, the  Company\'s Form 1120-REIT for its taxable years 2004 [and
2005]1 ,  the  Company\'s annual and quarterly REIT testing schedules
prepared by the Company  and reviewed by Ernst and Young, L.L.P. for each
quarter beginning with the  quarter ending December 31, 2004 and ending with
the quarter ending [most recent  quarter-end date prior to the date of the
opinion for which the testing schedule  is available], the Prospectus dated
September 20, 2004 issued in connection  with  the Company\'s initial
offering of 17,000,000 shares of its Common Stock and  such  other documents
as we deemed necessary or appropriate (the "Applicable  Documents"). In
addition, we have made such other factual and legal inquiries as  we have
considered necessary or appropriate, but we have not independently  verified
any of the facts set forth in any of the Applicable Documents. All 
capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to
them  in  the Merger Agreement.

   

1 To  be  added if the 2005 tax return has been filed on or before the date
of the  opinion.

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

The  Company has provided us with, and we are relying upon, a certificate
dated  [____], 200_ setting forth certain factual representations relating to
the  organization, actual operation and proposed operation of the Company
(the "Officer\'s Certificate"). These representations relate, in some cases,
to  transactions and investments for which we did not act as the Company\'s
primary  counsel and we have not independently verified any of the
representations  contained therein, although we are not aware of any facts
inconsistent with  such  representations.

 

 

Our  opinions set forth below assume (i) the accuracy of all facts set forth
in  the  Applicable Documents, including the fact that the Company has been
operated  in  the manner set forth in the Applicable Documents; (ii) that
all representations  contained in the Officer\'s Certificate are accurate and
complete without regard  to any qualification as to knowledge or belief; and
(iii) the genuineness of  all  signatures, the legal capacity of natural
persons, the authenticity of all  documents submitted to us as originals, and
the conformity to original documents  of all documents submitted to us as
reproductions, whether electronic or  otherwise.

 

 

Based  upon the foregoing and in reliance thereon, and subject to the
qualifications,  exceptions, assumptions and limitations herein contained, we
are of the opinion  that:

 

 

1. The  Company has made a valid election under Section 856(c)(1) of the Code to be  treated as a REIT and, together with those of its subsidiaries that are "qualified REIT subsidiaries" ("QRSs"), has been organized and operated in  conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under  the Code for all taxable years commencing with the Company\'s taxable year ended  December 31, 2004, through the taxable year ending prior to the date hereof[,  provided that we express no opinion with respect to the Company\'s compliance  with the annual distribution requirement of Section 857 of the Code for the  Company\'s taxable year ended December 31, 2006]2.  

 

 

2.   The  Company, together with those of its subsidiaries that are QRSs, (i) has been  organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation  as  a REIT for the current taxable year prior to the date hereof, (ii) has satisfied  all quarterly operational requirements for qualification and taxation as a  REIT  for each quarter of the current taxable year that has ended prior to the date  hereof, and (iii) has not been organized and operated prior to the date hereof  in such a manner that would prevent the Company from satisfying any other  requirement for qualification and taxation as a REIT for the current taxable  year (other than the annual distribution requirement under Section 857 of the  Code).  

**[To  ensure compliance with Treasury Department Circular 230, you are
hereby notified  that (a) any discussion of federal tax issues in this
opinion is not intended  or  written to be relied upon, and cannot be relied
upon, by the Acquiror for the  purpose of avoiding penalties that may be
imposed on such holder under the  Internal Revenue Code and (b) promoting,
marketing or recommending to another  party any matters addressed**

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

**herein.  ] [To be included to the extent and in the form determined by
Gibson, Dunn  and  Crutcher to be required.]**

 

 

The  Company\'s qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon its ability
to meet,  through actual operating results, certain requirements relating to
the sources  of its income, the nature of its assets, distribution levels and
diversity  of  stock ownership, recordkeeping, and other various
qualification tests imposed  under the Code, which results are not reviewed
by us. Accordingly, no assurance  can be given that the actual results of the
Company\'s operation for any given  taxable year will satisfy the
requirements for taxation as a REIT under the  Code.

 

 

Our  opinion is based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986,  as  amended, Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, published
pronouncements  of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), and case law,
any of which may be  changed at any time with retroactive effect. You should
be aware that opinions  of counsel are not binding on the Internal Revenue
Service and no assurance  can  be given that the IRS will not challenge the
conclusions set forth herein.  Any  change in applicable law, or any
inaccuracy in the statements, facts,  assumptions, and representations on
which we relied, may affect the continuing  validity of the opinion set forth
herein. We assume no responsibility to inform  you of any such changes or
inaccuracy that may occur or come to our  attention.

 

 

This  opinion is furnished to you in connection with the transactions
contemplated  by  the Merger Agreement and is not to be used, circulated,
quoted or otherwise  referred to (other than to be provided to the Company's
auditors or to a  relevant taxing authority) for any other purpose without
our prior written  consent.

 

 

Very  truly yours,

_REIT  Federal Income Tax Opinion_

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

Ladies  and Gentlemen:

 

 

Angle  Capital, Inc. (the "Company") has requested your opinion with respect
to the  status of the Company as a real estate investment trust (a "REIT")
under  Sections 856 et. seq. of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the  "Code")  pursuant  to Section 7.02(c) of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger dated August __,  2006.  In  connection with your opinion, I, Robert
B. Eastep of the Company, make the  following representations to you in my
capacity as Executive Vice President  and  Chief Financial Officer of the
Company. I understand that you will be relying  on  the representations of
fact contained in this letter (this "Certificate") as the  basis for your
opinion. As an executive officer, it is my responsibility to  have 
knowledge of the matters described in these representations. The
representations  of fact contained in this Certificate are, to the best of my
knowledge, true,  complete and correct. I have reviewed this Certificate with
you and acknowledge  that I understand the defined terms and statutory
references contained herein. 

 

 

(1) The  Company was validly formed under the name "Angle REIT, Inc."
pursuant to the  General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland on February
5, 2004 (the "Incorporation Date"). The Company changed its name to "Angle
Capital, Inc." on  September 24, 2004.

 

 

(2) The  Company has operated in accordance with Maryland law, its
certificate of  incorporation, as supplemented or amended (the "Charter"),
and its  by-laws. 

 

 

(3) The  Company does not own any interest in any entity classified as a
partnership  for  U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Angle  Capital
Holdings, Inc. (and the Company's former subsidiary, Saxon Merger 
Corporation, Inc.) has made a valid and timely joint election with the
Company  to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") of the Company
under Section  856(l) of the Code, effective as of the date of formation of
such  subsidiary.

 

 

(4) The  Company timely made the election specified in Section 856(c) of the
Code to  be  taxed as a REIT commencing  with  its  taxable  year ending
December 31, 2004.

 

 

(5) Since  the  election of the Company\'s initial directors, the Company
has been managed by  directors, and the Company\'s directors have ratified
and confirmed all actions  taken by the Company\'s sole incorporator on the
Company\'s behalf from the date  of the Company\'s

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

incorporation  until the Company\'s initial directors were elected. Since the
Incorporation  Date, the Company has issued shares of a single class of
common stock which  represent all the beneficial ownership interests in the
Company and all such  interests are evidenced by transferable shares. With
the exception of the  restrictions imposed on the transfer of common stock
under the charter of the  Company, under the federal or state securities
laws, or under the Company's  stock incentive plans, there are no
restrictions on the transfer of common  stock.

 

 

(6) Since  the  Incorporation Date, no more than 50 percent in value of the
Company\'s  outstanding stock has been owned, directly or indirectly, by or
for five or  fewer individuals (including certain entities as defined in
Section 542(a)(2)  of  the Code) as determined by applying Section 856(h) of
the Code and determined  without regard to the shares-in-trust provisions
contained in the Company\'s  Charter.

 

 

(7) Since  the  Incorporation Date, no person has beneficially owned stock
of the Company in  violation of the restrictions regarding the ownership and
transfer of the  Company\'s stock set forth in the Charter (the "Ownership
Limit"). The Board of  Directors of the Company has waived the Ownership
Limit with respect to any  individual or entity only if, in the opinion of
the Board of Directors,  sufficient evidence was presented that the proposed
changes in ownership would  not then or in the future jeopardize the
Company\'s status as a REIT and the  Board of Directors otherwise decided
that such action was in the best interest  of the Company. Since the
Incorporation Date, the Board of Directors has granted  waivers of the
Ownership Limit to Wasatch Advisors, Inc. ("Wasatch") and  Franklin Mutual
Advisors, LLC ("Franklin"). Neither Wasatch nor Franklin has  at  any time
owned an interest in the Company in an amount sufficient to jeopardize  the
Company\'s status as a REIT.

 

 

(8) At  all times  during each taxable  year  of the  Company beginning
after its first taxable year  (and  including its current taxable year prior
to the date hereof),  the  beneficial ownership of the Company has been held
by 100 or more persons. 

 

 

(9) For  each  taxable year ending prior to the date hereof commencing with
the Company\'s  initial taxable year, the Company has satisfied  the annual
income tests, the Assets Tests (as defined in paragraph 20 below)  and  the
annual distribution requirements that must be satisfied in order for the 
Company to qualify as a REIT under the Code. The Company has not been
organized  or operated prior to the date hereof in such a manner that would
prevent the  Company from satisfying the annual income tests or the Assets
Tests for the  current taxable year or for any quarter thereof.

 

 

(10) The  Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any Interests in Real
Property  (other than Foreclosure Property, or commercial office space or
other property  intended for use in the Company\'s business rather than for
rental real estate  investment). The Company has satisfied the Assets Tests
by  acquiring and holding mortgages and mortgage-related assets. The
Company's  ownership of assets prior to the date hereof will not prevent the
Company from  satisfying the Assets Tests for the current taxable year or for
any quarter  thereof.

 

 

(11) Since  the  Incorporation Date and for each of the Company's taxable
years ending prior to  the date hereof, at least 95% of the gross income of
the Company (excluding  gross

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

income  from Prohibited Transactions) has been derived from (i) dividends,
(ii)  interest ~~,~~   (excluding interest the amount of which depends on
the income or profits of  any  person, is based on the value of any property
or is contingent upon the sale  or  refinancing of the property securing the
obligations), (iii) rents from real  property (excluding any rents which
depend upon the income or profits of any  person or which are received from
persons of whom the Company owns an interest  of 10% or more), (iv) gain from
the sale or other disposition of stock,  securities and real property
(including Interests in Real Property and interests  in mortgages on real
property), but excluding gain on real property which is  Section 1221(a)(1)
Property, (v) abatements and refunds of taxes on real  property, (vi) income
and gain derived from Foreclosure Property, (vii) amounts  (other than
amounts ~~,~~   the  determination of which depends in whole or in part on
income or profits of  any  Person) received or accrued as consideration for
entering into agreements (A)  to  make loans secured by mortgages on real
property or on Interests in Real  Property, or (B) to purchase or lease real
property (including Interests in  Real  Property and interests in mortgages
on real property), and (viii) gain from  the  sale or other disposition of
Real Estate Assets which is not a Prohibited  Transaction, in each case,
within the meaning of Section 856(c)(2) of the Code  (the "95% gross income
test"). The  Company has not been operated prior to the date hereof in such a
manner that  would prevent the Company from satisfying the 95% gross income
test for the  current taxable year.

 

 

(12) Since  the  Incorporation Date and for each of the Company's taxable
years ending prior to  the date hereof, at least 75% of the gross income of
the Company (excluding  gross income from Prohibited Transactions) has been
derived from (i) rents  from  real property (excluding any rents which
depend upon the income or profits  of  any person or which are received from
persons of whom the Company owns an  interest of 10% or more), (ii) interest
on obligations secured by mortgages  on  real property or on Interests in
Real Property (excluding interest the amount  of  which depends on the
income or profits of any person, is based on the value  of  any property or
is contingent upon the sale or refinancing of the property  securing the
obligations), and only to the extent such interest is apportioned  to real
property based on the value of any property securing such obligations  in 
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.856-5(c), (iii) interest on
loans  described in Revenue Procedure 2003-65, (iv) gain from the sale or
disposition  of real property (including Interests in Real Property and
interests in  mortgages on real property), but excluding gain from real
property which is  Section 1221(a)(1) Property, (v) dividends or other
distributions on, and gain  (other than gain from Prohibited Transactions)
from the sale or other  disposition of, transferable shares or certificates
of beneficial interest  in  other REITs, (vi) abatements and refunds of
taxes on real property, (vii) income  and gain derived from Foreclosure
Property; (viii) amounts (other than amounts,  the determination of which
depends in whole or in part on the income or profits  of any Person) received
or accrued as consideration for entering into agreements  (A) to make loans
secured by mortgages on real property or on Interests in  Real  Property, or
(B) to purchase or lease real property (including Interests in  Real 
Property and interests in mortgages on real property), (ix) gain from the
sale  or other disposition of Real Estate Assets which is not a Prohibited 
Transaction; and (x) Qualified Temporary Investment Income, in each case,
within  the meaning of Section 856(c)(3) of the Code (the "75% gross income
test"). The  Company has not been operated prior to the date hereof in such a
manner that  would prevent the Company from satisfying the 75% gross income
test for the  current taxable year.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

(13)   The Company has compiled an analysis regarding its compliance with the
95%  and  75% gross income tests described in paragraphs 11 and 12 above for
all taxable  years ending prior to the date hereof beginning with its first
taxable  year.

 

 

(14) The  Company understands that for purposes of the 95% and 75% gross
income tests  described in paragraphs 11 and 12 above, income derived from
payments to the  Company under any hedging instruments that are not Qualified
Hedges, as well  as  any gains from the disposition of such instruments,
does not qualify for either  the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross
income test. The Company has treated  all hedging income, other than payments
derived from Qualified Hedges, as not  qualifying for either the 75% gross
income test or the 95% gross income test.  The Company has treated ~~,~~  
all  payments derived from Qualified Hedges as excluded from the 95% gross
income  test, but not the 75% gross income test,  for all  taxable years
beginning January 1, 2005 or thereafter. For the Company's taxable  year
ending December 31, 2004, the Company has treated payments under a interest 
rate swap or cap agreement, option, futures contract, forward rate agreement 
or  any similar financial instrument entered into in a transaction to reduce
the  interest rate risks with respect to any indebtedness incurred or to be
incurred  to acquire or carry Real Estate Assets, and gain from the sale or
other  disposition of such an instrument, as income qualifying for purposes
of the  95%  gross income test _._

 

 

(15) The  Company, either directly or indirectly, other than (i) in
connection with Angle  Funding Management, Inc.\'s master servicing function,
or (ii) through a TRS,  has  not actively conducted a business from which it
earns fees (or other income),  including, without limitation, mortgage loan
origination fees or loan servicing  fees, for services it performs, whether
or not through a manager. The fees  earned by Angle Funding Management, Inc.
in connection with its master servicing  function have not been sufficient in
amount to prevent the Company from  qualifying for either the 75% gross
income test or the 95% gross income test  for  any taxable year including
the current taxable year.

 

 

(16) Since  the  Incorporation Date, (a) at least 75 percent of the value of
the total assets  of  the Company (held directly, through any partnership or
through any limited  liability company or other entity that is either treated
as a partnership or  ignored for federal income tax purposes) has consisted
of Real  Estate Assets,  cash  and cash items and government securities
(the "75% assets test"), (b) not more  than 25 percent of the value of its
total assets has been represented by  securities (other than government
securities) as determined in accordance with  Section 856(c)(4)(B) of the
Code and Section 1.856-2(d)(2) of the Treasury  Regulations (the "25% assets
test") and (c) not more than 20 percent of the  value of its total assets has
been represented by securities of one or more  TRSs  of the Company (the
"20% securities test"). The Company has met each of the  three preceding
tests at the end of each calendar quarter since the  Incorporation Date, and
the Company\'s knowledge that it has met these tests  at  the end of each
calendar quarter is based on accurate and complete information  compiled as
part of its accounting books and records. The Company has not been  operated
prior to the date hereof in such a manner that would prevent the  Company
from satisfying any of the three preceding tests for the current  calendar
quarter.

 

 

(17) The  Company has never owned (directly, through any partnership or
through any  limited liability company or other entity that is either treated
as a  partnership or ignored for

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

federal  income tax purposes) securities of any one issuer (including mutual
funds),  other than a TRS or a qualified REIT subsidiary of the Company or a
REIT, having  an aggregate value in excess of 5 percent of the value of the
total assets  of  the Company, as determined in accordance with Section
856(c)(4)(B) of the Code  and Section 1.856-2(d)(2) of the Treasury
Regulations (the "5% securities  test").

 

 

(18) The  Company has never owned (directly, through any partnership or
through any  limited liability company or other entity that is either treated
as a  partnership or ignored for federal income tax purposes) securities of
any one  issuer (including mutual funds), other than a TRS or a qualified
REIT subsidiary  of the Company or a REIT, that either (a) possess more than
10 percent of the  total voting power of the outstanding securities of such
issuer or (b) have  a  value of more than 10 percent of the total value of
the outstanding securities  of such issuer, provided that the foregoing does
not take into account any  securities that are not treated as securities
pursuant to Section 856(m) of  the  Code (the "10% securities test").

 

 

(19) The  Company and any qualified REIT subsidiary of the Company have held
all of their  assets for investment purposes and not as (a) stock in trade or
other property  of a kind which would properly be includible in inventory if
on hand at the  close of the taxable year, or (b) property held primarily for
sale to customers  in the ordinary course of their respective trades or
businesses.

 

 

(20) The  Company has monitored the value of its assets to maintain
compliance with each  of the 75% assets test, the 25% assets test, the 20%
securities test, the 10%  securities test and the 5% securities test, as set
forth in paragraphs 16  through 18 above (collectively, the "Assets Tests")
on a quarterly basis.  Additionally, as required by Section 1.856-2(d)(3) of
the Treasury Regulations,  for each calendar quarter the Company has prepared
schedules setting forth  the  fair market values of the Company's assets as
of the end of each calendar  quarter.

 

 

(21) With  respect to each loan held by the Company, the amount of the loan
on the date  of  its origination did not exceed the fair market value of the
real property secured  by such loan,  except  by amounts which would not
cause the Company to fail to meet the 75% gross  income test, the 95% gross
income test, or the Assets Tests.

 

 

(22) The  Company has made with respect to each taxable year since the
Incorporation  Date  (excluding the taxable year ending December 31, 2006
[and the current taxable  year, if different from the taxable year ending
December 31, 2006]3 )  timely  distributions sufficient to satisfy the
annual distribution requirements of  Section 857 of the Code. From time to
time, the Company may have been required  to pay a distribution to
shareholders that is considered under Section 858  of  the Code to have been
paid during the Company\'s prior taxable year (a "Section  858 Dividend"). To
the extent that a Section 858 Dividend has been required, the  Company has
(i) declared the Section 858 Dividend before the due date of the  Company\'s
tax return (including extensions) for the taxable year to which the  Section
858 Dividend applies, (ii) distributed such dividend not later than  the 
date of the Company\'s first regular dividend payment made after the

 

   

3 To  be  added only if the current taxable year is not the 2006 tax year.

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

declaration,  and (iii) elected on its timely filed tax return for the
taxable year to which  the Section 858 Dividend applies to consider such
dividend as having been paid  only during that taxable year and specified the
dollar amount of such election.  The Company has ensured that it had earnings
and profits in such taxable year  equal to or greater than the amount of the
Section 858 Dividend plus all  distributions made by the Company applicable
to that respective taxable year.  The Company has made any required notices
of capital gain dividends with respect  to the Section 858 dividend to its
shareholders as required by the  Code.

 

 

(23) The  Company has not made any distributions to its stockholders with
respect to  its  capital stock unless such distribution was pro rata, with
no preference to  any  shares of a particular class as compared with other
shares of the same class,  and it has not made any distributions that give a
preference to one class of  shares as compared with another class except to
the extent that the former  was  entitled (without reference to waivers of
any rights by the stockholders) to  such preferences.

 

 

(24) The  Company has complied with the recordkeeping and shareholder polling
requirements  applicable to REITs in accordance with Section 1.857-8 of the
Treasury  Regulations.

 

 

(25) The  Company\'s taxable year is the calendar year.

 

 

(26) The  Company does not have, and has never had, any earnings and
profits  of any  corporation  accumulated in any non-REIT year.

 

 

(27)  To  the  extent the Company securitizes mortgage loans and sells the
securities, the  Company has done so through one or more TRSs, and the
Company has made the  necessary TRS election for each of these subsidiaries
and has monitored the  value of its investments and the amount of dividends
received from such  subsidiaries to ensure compliance with the applicable
income and asset tests.  For this purpose, a "securitization" includes any
borrowing by the Company which  for federal income tax purposes would be
treated as a sale of all or a portion  of the mortgage loans that are subject
to the borrowing, including without  limitation by means of a REMIC.

 

 

(28)  Neither  the Company nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates is a
former REIT, or  a  successor to assets of a REIT or a former REIT, whose
REIT election was  disallowed or otherwise terminated (taking into account
the effect of the REIT  transaction occurring on September 24, 2004 that
resulted in the Company's  former captive REIT subsidiary, Saxon Securities
and Certificates, Inc.,  becoming a QRS).

 

 

(29)  The  Company has not disposed of any interest with respect to any
entity that is  intended to be a "taxable mortgage pool" within the meaning
of Section 7701(i)  of the Code, other than any interest with respect to
which the issuer of such  interest has obtained an opinion that such interest
constitutes indebtedness  for  U.S. federal income tax purposes.

 

 

(30) The  Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances contrary to or
inconsistent  with the foregoing representations.

 

 

You  may rely on the representations of fact contained in  this Certificate.
The representations of fact set forth in this Certificate  are  solely for
your use in rendering your tax opinion.
