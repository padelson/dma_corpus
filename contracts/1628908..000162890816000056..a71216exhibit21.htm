(a)At or immediately prior to the Closing, Evolent or Merger Sub shall pay (on

2.6 Treatment of Equity Awards and Warrants.

(a)Treatment of Company Options. As of the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding and unexercised option to acquire Shares (a "Company Option")
shall vest in full (to the extent not previously vested), and shall be
canceled by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder of such Company Option, in consideration for the right to receive a
cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (x) the number of
Shares subject to such Company Option and (y) the excess (if any) of (A) an
amount equal to the sum of the per share consideration payable with respect to
the shares of capital stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the holder's pro rata share (if any)
of the adjustments made under Section 2.11 and Section 2.12, when and if paid,
and with the cash value of any portion of the Total Merger Consideration
payable in shares of Evolent Common Stock determined based on calculation
methodology set forth in the Charter), over (B) the exercise price per Share
subject to such Company Option (the "Option Payment"). The Surviving Entity
shall cause the Option Payment to be paid, without interest and less any
required withholding Taxes, as promptly as practicable following the time that
any corresponding portion of the Total Merger



8



Consideration is paid to Valence Parent stockholders generally, in accordance
with the payroll procedures of the Surviving Entity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing regarding payment of the Option Payment in cash, each holder of a
Company Option that is an Accredited Investor, may irrevocably elect within 20
Business Days of the date hereof to receive the Merger Consideration payable
to a holder of the Shares issuable upon exercise of a Company Option in the
form of Evolent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.2 hereof; provided,
however, that such election shall be to Evolent and Valence Parent and be in a
written form reasonably acceptable to Evolent and contain an agreement to be
bound by and subject to the indemnification provisions of an Equityholder set
forth in Article IX of this Agreement.



(b)Treatment of Company Restricted Shares. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each then-outstanding Share subject to vesting, repurchase or other
lapse conditions shall vest in full and become free of such restrictions, and
any repurchase right shall lapse, and each such Share shall be subject to this
Article II (including, without limitation, Section 2.2 hereof).



(c)Treatment of Company Warrants. As of the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding and unexercised warrant to acquire Shares (a "Company Warrant")
shall vest in full (to the extent not previously vested), and shall be
canceled by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder of such Company Warrant, in consideration for the right to receive the
product of (x) the number of Shares subject to such Company Warrant and (y the
excess (if any) of (A) an amount equal to the sum of the per share
consideration payable with respect to the share of capital stock issuable upon
exercise of such Company Option (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
holder's pro rata share (if any) of the adjustments made under Section 2.11
and Section 2.12, when and if paid, and with the cash value of any portion of
the Total Merger Consideration payable in shares of Evolent Common Stock
determined based on calculation methodology set forth in the Charter), over
(B) the exercise price per Share subject to such Company Warrant (the "Warrant
Closing Payment").



2.7 Payment Mechanics.

(a)Designation of Paying Agent. Promptly following the date hereof, Valence
Parent shall engage U.S. Bank National Association to act as the Paying Agent
in the Merger (the "Paying Agent"). All payments and distributions to be made
by the Paying Agent to the Equityholders shall be made in a manner consistent
with the payment calculation delivered by the Secueritholders' Representative
to the Paying Agent (the "Waterfall").



(b)Deposit With Paying Agent. At or immediately prior to the Closing, Evolent
shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Paying Agent
cash and provide the Paying Agent with evidence of book-entry shares of
Evolent Common Stock representing the Closing Consideration. At or immediately
prior to the Closing, Evolent shall remit to the Securityholders'
Representative, for the benefit of the Securityholders, cash in an amount
equal to $500,000 (the "Securityholders' Representative Expense Fund").



(c)Payment of Escrow Consideration. At or immediately prior to the Closing,
Evolent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Escrow Agent and deposit shares of Evolent Common Stock, on behalf of the
Securityholders, for deposit into a separate escrow account (the "Escrow
Fund"), shares of Evolent Common Stock valued on the Closing Date (based on
the Valuation Methodology) in an amount necessary to pay the Escrow
Consideration, which shall be held, invested and disbursed by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Tax
treatment of the Escrow Consideration and the Escrow Fund shall be described
in, and otherwise governed by, the terms of the Escrow Agreement.





9



(d)Withholding. Each of Evolent and its Affiliates (without duplication) shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable to any
Person under the terms of this Agreement such amounts as it may reasonably
believe are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of federal, state, local, or foreign Tax law.
Other than with respect to payments of the Total Merger Consideration being
made to holders of Company Options, Evolent and its Affiliates shall provide
any party on behalf of which such deduction or withholding is proposed to be
made with written notice of its intention to make such deduction or
withholding (such notice to be provided at least a commercially reasonable
period of time before such deduction or withholding is required), which notice
shall include the authority, basis and method of calculation for the proposed
deduction or withholding, and Evolent and its Affiliates will cooperate with
any reasonable request from such party to obtain reduction of or relief from
such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Evolent or any of its Affiliates and paid over to the appropriate Tax
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the relevant Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.



(e)Mailing of Letters of Transmittal; Exchange. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Paying
Agent shall mail or otherwise deliver, or cause to be mailed or otherwise
delivered, to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the
"Certificates") that represent outstanding Shares, a Letter of Transmittal
(together with an Investor Questionnaire in a form reasonably acceptable to
Evolent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for payment of the applicable portion of the Total
Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying
Agent, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive, subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, in exchange therefor, payment of the applicable portion of the Total
Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.2, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled,
such payment to be payable on the later of the Closing Date and a date
promptly after the Paying Agent's receipt of the Letter of Transmittal (if
received after the Closing Date). Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.7(e), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
applicable portion of the Total Merger Consideration. Except as expressly
provided herein, no interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable
upon surrender of any Certificate.



(f)Non-Registered Holders. If any portion of the Total Merger Consideration is
to be paid or issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate for the related Shares is registered, then it will be a condition
to such payment that (i) the Certificate so surrendered will be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person
requesting such exchange will have paid any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of such payment in a name other than the registered holder or will
have established to the satisfaction of Evolent (or any agent designated by
Evolent) that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.



(g)Unclaimed Amounts. At any time following twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, all consideration deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to
Section 2.7(b) that remains undistributed to the Securityholders shall be
delivered to Evolent upon demand, and thereafter the affected Securityholders
shall be entitled to look only to Evolent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Legal Requirements and Section 9.2). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Paying Agent, Evolent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity or the Securityholders' Representative shall
be liable to any Securityholder for any amount delivered to a Governmental
Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
applicable Legal Requirement.





10



(h)Notice. No later than ten (10) days following the date hereof, the Valence
Entities shall provide a written statement (the "Notice of Appraisal Rights")
to each of the Securityholders who has not then signed the Stockholder Action
by Written Consent contemplated by Section 5.2 notifying each such
Securityholder of (i) such Stockholder Action by Written Consent, which notice
will be in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL, and (ii) such
Securityholder's appraisal rights under the DGCL, which notice will be in
accordance with Section 262(b) of the DGCL. The Valence Entities shall provide
a draft of such written statement to Evolent prior to delivery thereof, and
such written statement shall be in form mutually acceptable to the
Securityholders' Representative and Evolent.



(i)Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, if any Securityholder makes a demand for appraisal of such
Securityholder's Shares in accordance with the DGCL (any such Shares being
referred to as "Dissenting Shares" until such time that such Securityholder
fails to perfect or otherwise loses such Securityholder's appraisal rights
under the DGCL with respect to such Shares), the Dissenting Shares held by
such Securityholder shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive Total Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II (and
Evolent shall, pending resolution of such demand, retain any amounts that
would otherwise be paid to such holder of Dissenting Shares pursuant to this
Article II), but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the
DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares. Subject to Section 9.2(e), following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall be responsible to the holders
of Dissenting Shares in accordance with the DGCL. If any Dissenting Shares
shall lose their status as such (through failure to perfect or otherwise),
then, as of the date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically
be deemed to have been converted into as of the Effective Time and shall
represent only the right to receive a portion of the Total Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article II, without interest thereon,
upon delivery of (i) a Letter of Transmittal, executed and delivered by such
Securityholder, together with any Certificates formerly representing the
Shares held by such Securityholder (and, in the case of any lost or damaged
Certificates formerly representing the Shares held by such Securityholder, an
affidavit of lost or damaged certificate in respect thereof), and (ii) a
Release, executed and delivered by such Securityholder. Evolent shall give the
Securityholders' Representative prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
received by the Surviving Entity, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
similar instruments or notices served upon the Surviving Entity pursuant to
the DGCL, and the Securityholders' Representative shall be entitled to assume
the negotiations, settlement and defense of any claims related to any
Dissenting Shares.



11





2.8 Reallocation of Evolent Common Stock and Alternative Closing Payment. In
connection with soliciting Letters of Transmittal pursuant to Section 2.7(e),
the Company shall deliver to each of the Securityholders an "Investor
Questionnaire" (the "Investor Questionnaires") which shall solicit certain
information from such Securityholder relative to such person's qualification
as an "accredited investor" as defined in Regulation D under the Securities
Act (an "Accredited Investor"). With respect to (a) each Accredited Investor,
such Accredited Investor shall receive the consideration to which such
Securityholder is entitled to receive pursuant to the Charter with respect to
the Merger or (b) each Unaccredited Investor (as defined in the Charter) or
other Securityholder who fails to provide a fully executed Investor
Questionnaire on or prior to the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the
Closing Date such that Evolent may reasonably determine that such
Securityholder is an Accredited Investor (such person, an "Unaccredited
Stockholder"), then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, such Accredited Investor shall receive the consideration to which
such Unaccredited Stockholder is entitled to receive pursuant to the Charter
with respect to the Merger.



2.9 Further Ownership Rights. The Total Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares (including any
rights to receive accumulated but undeclared dividends on such Shares). At the
Effective Time, the equity transfer books of Valence Parent shall be closed,
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares
on the records of the Surviving Entity, and from and after the Effective Time
the Securityholders shall cease to have any rights (including any rights to
receive accumulated but undeclared dividends on any Shares) with respect
thereto except as otherwise provided for herein. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall
be cancelled as provided in this Article II.



2.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates
representing Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
Agent shall pay the applicable Total Merger Consideration in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the holder thereof in a form reasonably satisfactory to Evolent and
the Surviving Entity agreeing to indemnify Evolent and the Surviving Entity
against any claim that may be made against Evolent or the Surviving Entity
with respect to such Certificate.



2.11 Post-Closing Adjustment.



(a)As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but not later
than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Evolent shall prepare and
deliver to the Securityholders' Representative an unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of the Business as of the Adjustment Time (the "Final Closing
Date Balance Sheet") and a calculation in the same format as the Example
Calculation (the "Final Calculation" and, together with the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet, the "Adjustment Statements") setting forth Evolent's
calculations of (i) the Closing Date Net Working Capital (the "Final Closing
Date Net Working Capital"), (ii) the Indebtedness Payoff Amount as of the
Closing Date, (iii) the Liability Coverage Amount as of the Adjustment Time,
and (iv) the Valence Transaction Expenses as of the Closing Date. The Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP as
modified by the Specified Accounting Principles.



(b)Within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Adjustment Statements, the
Securityholders' Representative may deliver written notice (the "Protest
Notice") to Evolent of any objections that the Securityholders' Representative
may have to the Adjustment Statements based solely on manifest error, the
failure of the Adjustment Statements to follow GAAP as modified by the
Specified Accounting Principles or the application of GAAP as modified by the
Specified Accounting Principles.



12



Such Protest Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis of such
objection together with the amount(s) in dispute. Upon receipt of the
Adjustment Statements, the Securityholders' Representative and its
representatives shall be given reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to all of the Surviving Entity's books and records (including working
papers, schedules and calculations) reasonably relating to the preparation of
the Adjustment Statements. The Securityholders' Representative and its
representatives may make inquiries of Evolent, the Surviving Entity and their
respective representatives regarding questions concerning or disagreements
with the Adjustment Statements arising in the course of their review thereof,
and Evolent shall use its, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to use its,
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and respond to such
inquiries. If the Securityholders' Representative does not deliver a Protest
Notice within such thirty (30) day period after delivery of the Adjustment
Statements to Evolent, the Adjustment Statements shall become final and
binding on the parties.



(c)For the thirty (30) day period following Evolent's receipt of a Protest
Notice, Evolent and the Securityholders' Representative shall attempt in good
faith to resolve any dispute regarding the Adjustment Statements (and all such
discussions related thereto shall, unless otherwise agreed by Evolent and the
Securityholders' Representative, be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules
of Evidence (and any applicable similar state rule)). If the Securityholders'
Representative and Evolent reach agreement with respect to any such disputes
within the thirty (30) day period, Evolent shall revise the Adjustment
Statements to reflect such agreement in a manner that is mutually acceptable
to the Securityholders' Representative and Evolent. If Evolent and the
Securityholders' Representative are unable to resolve any disagreement with
respect to the Adjustment Statements within thirty (30) days following
Evolent's receipt of the Protest Notice, then such dispute shall be submitted
to a mutually agreeable accountant to be identified by the parties hereto
within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof (the "Arbitrating
Accountant"). The Arbitrating Accountant will be instructed to send to Evolent
and the Securityholders' Representative, within thirty (30) days of the date
on which such dispute is referred to such Arbitrating Accountant, its
determination on the specific matters in dispute. Evolent and the
Securityholders' Representative will each bear fifty percent (50%) of the fees
and costs of the Arbitrating Accountant for such determination. The
Arbitrating Accountant shall determine, based solely on the submissions by the
Securityholders' Representative and Evolent, and not by independent review,
only those issues set forth in the Protest Notice that remain in dispute and
shall determine a value for any such disputed item which is equal to or
between the final values proposed by Evolent and the Securityholders'
Representative in their respective submissions. The final determination with
respect to all dispute items shall be set forth in a written statement by the
Arbitrating Accountant delivered to Evolent and the Securityholders'
Representative and shall be final, conclusive and binding on Evolent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Entity and the Securityholders. Evolent and the
Securityholders' Representative shall promptly execute any reasonable
engagement letter requested by the Arbitrating Accountant and shall each
cooperate fully with the Arbitrating Accountant, including by providing the
information, data and work papers used by each party to prepare and/or
calculate the Adjustment Statements, making its personnel and accountants
available to explain any such information, data or work papers, so as to
enable the Arbitrating Accountant to make such determination as quickly and as
accurately as practicable.

Evolent, on the other hand, is referred to as the "Final Adjustment Amount";
it being understood and agreed that if the net effect pursuant to this Section
2.11(d)(v) is an increase in the Closing Consideration, then Evolent shall pay
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Securityholders'
Representative, in trust for the Securityholders, an amount in cash equal to
the Final Adjustment Amount, and if the net effect pursuant to this Section
2.11(d)(v) is a decrease in the Closing Consideration, then Evolent shall be
entitled to claim the amount of such Final Adjustment Amount due to it from

requested by Evolent for purposes of verifying the Qualified Eligible
Bookings, 2017 Contracted Revenue and the calculation of the Earnout Amount.
Following the Closing, Evolent shall permit the Securityholders'
Representative and its representatives to have reasonable access to the
Surviving Entity's personnel, books and records and any other documents or
information reasonably requested by the Securityholders' Representative for
purposes of verifying the Qualified Eligible Bookings, 2017 Contracted Revenue
and Evolent's calculation of the Earnout Amount.



(iv)In the event of any dispute between Evolent, Valence Parent and/or the
Securityholders' Representative with respect to this Section 2.12, the parties
agree to negotiate to resolve such dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that the parties have not been able to resolve such dispute within
thirty (30) days' notice of such dispute, the Securityholders' Representative
and Evolent shall submit the issues remaining in dispute to the Arbitrating
Accountant, for resolution in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.12.
If issues are submitted to the Arbitrating Accountant for resolution, (A) the
Securityholders' Representative and Evolent shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to the Arbitrating Accountant such work papers and other documents

may request and are available to that party or its agents and shall be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Arbitrating Accountant any material
relating to the disputed issues and to discuss issues with the Arbitrating
Accountant; (B) the determination by the Arbitrating Accountant, as set forth
in a notice to be delivered to both Evolent and the Securityholders'
Representative within thirty (30) days of the submission to the Arbitrating
Accountant of the issues remaining in dispute, shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties and shall be used in the calculation of the Earnout



16



Amount; (C) the Arbitrating Accountant shall make a final determination of
such Earnout Amount based solely on the items that are in dispute and, in
resolving such items in dispute, the Arbitrating Accountant shall not assign
to any item in dispute a value that is, as applicable (i) greater than the
greatest value for such item assigned by Evolent, on the one hand, or the
Securityholders' Representative, on the other hand, or (ii) less than the
smallest value for such item assigned by Evolent, on the one hand, or the
Securityholders' Representative, on the other hand; and (D) Evolent and the
Securityholders' Representative shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of the
fees and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountant for such determination. No
party shall be deemed to be in breach of any covenant set forth in Sections
2.12(b)(i) or 2.12(b)(ii) with respect to the timing of the issuance of the
Earnout Amount if such party is disputing the Earnout Amount in good faith.



(v)The issuance of any Earnout Amount shall be treated by Evolent and the
Securityholders as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all income
Tax purposes, unless a final determination (which shall include the execution
of a Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to such payment causes any
such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration
for Tax purposes and may be eligible for reporting as income from an
"installment sale" within the meaning of Section 453 of the Code.



(vi)Any issuance of shares of Evolent Common Stock in satisfaction of the
Earnout Amount shall be made by Evolent through the Paying Agent in a manner
consistent with Section 2.7.



(c)Certain Events. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as a
restriction or limitation on Evolent's or its Affiliates' right or ability (i)
to merge or consolidate the Surviving Entity or its business into, or
otherwise transfer or assign the Surviving Entity or its business to, Evolent
or any of its Affiliates (an "Affiliate Business"), (ii) to acquire by
purchase, exchange, merger, asset sale, or otherwise, any other Person,
whether or not engaged in a business similar or related to the business of the
Surviving Entity (an "Acquired Business"), or (iii) to sell or transfer the
Surviving Entity or its business to any Person that is not an Affiliate of
Evolent, whether via a sale of all of the equity, exchange, merger, asset sale
or otherwise (a "Sale"). The Securityholders shall not have any rights or
interests in or relating to any such Affiliate Business or Acquired Business.
In the event of the completion of any such transaction with any Affiliate
Business or Acquired Business on or prior to the end of the Earnout Period,
for purposes of the calculation of any Earnout Amount payable hereunder,
Evolent shall account for any Affiliate Business or Acquired Business such
that the calculation of any Earnout Amount payable hereunder (A) shall not be
affected by such transaction or event involving an Affiliate Business or
Acquired Business, and (B) will continue to be reasonably determinable
pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.12. In addition, in the event that
Evolent completes any Sale on or prior to the end of the Earnout Period,
Evolent shall cause the purchaser in the Sale to assume Evolent's obligations
under this Section 2.12 at the closing of such transaction.



(d)Acknowledgements. It is acknowledged and agreed that (i) following the
Closing, Evolent will have the authority and freedom to operate the business
of the Surviving Entity, free from any restrictions or obligations, express or
implied; (ii) neither Evolent nor its Affiliates is making, and the
Securityholders are not relying upon, any representations or warranties with
respect to the results of operations of the Surviving Entity following the
Closing or with respect to any estimates or projections prepared by Evolent or
its Affiliates with respect to such results of operations; and (iii) the
parties' relationship and obligations in respect of the subject matter of this
Section 2.12 and Evolent's obligation to pay any Earnout Amount will be solely
governed by the express provisions of this Agreement. Each of the
Securityholders hereby acknowledges and agrees (A) that Evolent's and its
Affiliates' boards of directors, managers and members owe their fiduciary
duties to their members and stockholders; (B) that



17



Evolent is a publicly traded corporation which conducts its business primarily
through direct and indirect Subsidiaries; and (C) that the boards of managers,
boards of directors and members of Evolent and its Affiliates, in their
exercise of their fiduciary duties to their stockholders and members, may
determine to undertake a range of actions to further accomplish the business
objectives of Evolent as the owner of a group of Subsidiaries engaged in its
business, none of which actions will be undertaken for the sole purpose of
having an adverse effect on amounts payable under this Section 2.12 or to
intentionally frustrate the ability of the Securityholders to receive payment
of any Earnout Amount. Toward that end, Evolent and its Affiliates (including
the Surviving Entity) shall be entitled to take any act (or refrain therefrom)
in the conduct of the Business if the action (or determination not to act) has
been determined by Evolent or its Affiliates in good faith to be reasonably
necessary to accomplish their business objectives.



(e)Earnout Not a Security. The Securityholders' Representative, on behalf of
the Securityholders, hereby agrees and acknowledges that the right to receive
the Earnout Amount, if any, pursuant to this Section 2.12 (i) is an integral
part of the total consideration of the acquisition of Valence Parent and not
an investment; (ii) does not represent an ownership interest in Evolent, the
Surviving Entity, or their respective Affiliates; (iii) does not carry voting,
dividend or liquidation rights; (iv) is not represented by any form of
certificate or instrument; and (v) shall not be assignable or transferable
(other than by testamentary disposition or the laws of intestacy).

in this Agreement, in no event will the maximum Earnout Amount issuable and
payable by Evolent hereunder exceed $50,000,000.

and contractor to execute proprietary information and confidentiality
agreements, and all current and former employees and contractors of Valence

the documents and instruments to be executed and delivered by it on the date
hereof or at the Closing pursuant to Sections 1.6(b) and 1.7 (collectively,
the "Evolent Closing Documents"), each of the Evolent Closing Documents will

to cause all of the conditions precedent to the Evolent Entities' and Valence
Parent's obligations set forth in Article VII to be satisfied, to the extent
that such party's action or inaction can control or influence the satisfaction
of such conditions. The obligations in this Section 5.9 shall apply between
the date hereof and the Closing Date.



44





5.10 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, the parties shall cooperate
reasonably with each other and with their respective representatives and
agents in connection with any steps required to be taken as part of their
respective obligations under this Agreement, and the parties agree (a) to
furnish upon request to the other parties such further information, (b) to
execute and deliver to each other such other documents, and (c) to do such
other acts and things, all as the other parties may reasonably request, for
the purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.



5.11 Certain Stockholder Approvals. Between the date hereof and the Closing
Date, Valence Parent shall seek and use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain waivers and will solicit stockholder or member approval in writing for
any payments that may, separately or in the aggregate, constitute "excess
parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) that may
be made to individuals who are "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning
of Section 280G(c) of the Code) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, such that such payments would not be deemed to
constitute "excess parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code.
At least five (5) days prior to taking any of the actions described in the
immediately preceding sentence, Valence Parent shall deliver to Evolent for
review and comment copies of the form of waiver to be executed by the
disqualified individuals, the stockholder disclosure statement and other
materials submitted to Valence Parent stockholders in connection with the
solicitation of stockholder approval of excess parachute payments, and Valence
Parent shall consider in good faith all comments timely received from Evolent
on such documents. Prior to the Closing Date, Valence Parent shall deliver to
Evolent notification and evidence reasonably satisfactory to Evolent that (a)
a vote was solicited in conformance with Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and
the requisite stockholder or member approval was obtained with respect to any
waived payments or benefits that were subject to the stockholder or member
vote, or (b) that such stockholder or member approval was not obtained and, as
a consequence, that such waived payments or benefits shall not be made or
provided to the extent they would cause any amounts to constitute "excess
parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code.

5.12 Reorganization. Prior to the Closing, Valence Parent shall effect the
Reorganization pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Reorganization
Agreement and deliver evidence reasonably satisfactory to Evolent that the
Reorganization has been completed.



5.13 Indemnification and Insurance.



(a)For a period of six (6) years following the Closing, Evolent will, or will
cause the Surviving Entity to, defend and hold harmless all current and former
directors and officers of Valence Parent (in their capacities as such) (each,
individually, a "Covered Person" and, collectively, the "Covered Persons")
from and against any Damages incurred by such Covered Person by reason of: (i)
any act or omission or alleged act or omission performed or omitted to be
performed on behalf of Valence Parent occurring on or prior to the Closing
Date; or (ii) the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of
Valence Parent, whether asserted or claimed prior to, on or following the
Closing Date, to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL (it being
understood that the DGCL requires that a Covered Person must have acted in
good faith and in a manner such Person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of Valence Parent, and with respect to any
criminal action or Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct
was unlawful), or the Organizational Documents of Valence Parent in effect on
the date hereof. Evolent or the Surviving Entity shall ensure that the
provisions in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity allowing
for the indemnification of the Covered Persons shall not be amended in a
manner that would limit the scope of such indemnification, except as required
by applicable Legal Requirements.





45



(b)Prior to the Adjustment Time, Valence Parent shall purchase a "tail"
insurance policy comparable to Valence Parent's current policy of directors'
and officers' liability insurance coverage for the Covered Persons and,
following the Closing, Evolent or the Surviving Entity shall maintain in
effect such "tail" policy for a period of six (6) years after the Closing
Date. Such "tail" policy shall (i) have a claim period of at least six (6)
years following the Closing Date, (ii) insure each Covered Person for acts and
omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) contain terms
and conditions which are not materially less favorable to the Covered Persons
than the directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage presently
maintained by Valence Parent with respect to claims arising from or related to
facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing Date.



(c)The provisions of this Section 5.13 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Covered Person and his or her heirs and
legal representatives.



(d)In the event that Evolent or the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges with or into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Evolent or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall succeed
to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.13.



5.14 Employee Matters.



(a)Effective as of the Effective Time until December 31, 2016, Evolent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Entity to continue the Company Benefit Plans
(excluding any equity or equity-based plan, program or arrangement) as in
effect on the date hereof.



(b)Effective as of the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Evolent shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Entity to
provide to employees of Valence Parent who continue to be employed by Evolent
or an Evolent Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time (the "Continuing Company Employees"), compensation and benefits
(excluding any equity or equity-based plan, program or arrangement), that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits
(excluding any equity or equity-based plan, program or arrangement and
severance, except to the extent provided for in Section 5.14(e)) paid and
provided to such Continuing Company Employee immediately prior to the date
hereof. No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Valence Parent shall deliver an update to Section 3.8(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule to reflect terminations in the normal course of business and any
other changes to the extent agreed to by Evolent.



(c)Following the Closing Date, Evolent shall, or shall cause an Evolent Entity
to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Evolent or its
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Company Employees are eligible to
participate following the Closing Date (collectively, the "Post-Closing
Plans") to recognize the service of each Continuing Company Employee with
Valence Parent prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting
and levels of benefits under such Post-Closing Plans, in each case, to the
same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective
Time under a comparable Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Company
Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided that such recognition of service shall not (i) apply for purposes of
any plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii) apply for purposes of
benefit accruals or participation eligibility under any defined benefit
pension plan or plan providing post-retirement pension plan benefits, (iii)
operate to duplicate any benefits of a Continuing Company Employee with
respect to the same period of service, or (iv) apply for purposes of any plan,
program or



46



arrangement (A) under which similarly situated employees of Evolent and its
Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (B) that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation.



(d)From and after the Closing Date, each Continuing Company Employee may use
and shall be credited with no less than the number of unused vacation days of
such Continuing Company Employee that accrued prior to the Closing Date.



(e)From the Closing Date until December 31, 2016, Evolent agrees to provide
each Continuing Company Employee whose employment is terminated "without
cause" (as defined in Section 5.14(e) of the Disclosure Schedule) by any
Evolent Entity with severance benefits (taking into account for such purpose
such Continuing Company Employee's service and compensation with Valence
Parent prior to the Closing Date and any additional service and compensation
with the Evolent Entities from and after the Closing Date) that are no less
favorable than those provided to such Continuing Company Employees under
Valence Parent's severance plans, policies and/or guidelines in effect as of
the date hereof, to the extent set forth on Section 5.14(e) of the Disclosure
Schedule.



(f)Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Valence Parent employee or
other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of any
Valence Entity, any Evolent Entity, or any Affiliate thereof, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Evolent Entities or
any of their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Employee Benefit
Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or
any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or
sponsored by Evolent, a Valence Entity or any of their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Evolent Entities,
Valence Parent or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any Employee Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this Section 5.14 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any
Valence Parent employee or current or former service provider of Valence
Parent or their Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).



(g)Valence Parent shall cooperate with Evolent and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to deliver to Evolent, within five (5) Business Days following
the date hereof, employment letters in the form provided by Evolent, duly
executed by Key Employees other than those previsouly delivered pursuant to
Section 1.7(c).



47





ARTICLE VI

TAX MATTERS



6.1 Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns.



(a)Valence Parent shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared
and timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of Valence Parent that are
required to be filed (taking into account any extensions) on or before the
Closing Date, and shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of Valence Parent
due on or before the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by
treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past
practices of Valence Parent, as applicable, with respect to such items, except
as required by applicable Legal Requirements.



(b)Evolent shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of Valence Parent that relate to any
Taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date or that relate to any
Straddle Periods, but that are required to be filed after the Closing Date.
Evolent shall deliver at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the due date
(taking into account any extension) for the filing of such Tax Returns to the
Securityholders' Representative for Securityholders' Representative's review a
draft of such Tax Returns. The Securityholders' Representative shall provide
Evolent with any comments to such Tax Returns no less than fifteen (15)
Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns (the "Tax Comments").
Not later than two (2) days prior to the filing of any such Tax Returns, the
Securityholders' Representative shall cause to be paid to Evolent any Taxes
payable pursuant to Section 9.2(c) of this Agreement. The Securityholders'
Representative and Evolent shall consult with each other and attempt in good
faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of any Tax Returns described
in this Section 6.1(b). Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant Tax
Return shall be timely filed on that basis. If the parties cannot resolve any
disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved by the Arbitrating
Accountant. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not resolved prior
to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the
manner in which Evolent deems correct, pending determination by the
Arbitrating Accountant.



6.2 Straddle Periods. For purposes of this Agreement, the pre-Closing portion
of any Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period will be (i)
in the case of Property Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, determined as though
the taxable year of Valence Parent terminated at the close of business on the
Closing Date.



6.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters.



(a)Evolent and the Securityholders' Representative shall cooperate fully, as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article VI and any Tax Contest.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's
request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to any such Tax Contest and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.



(b)Evolent and the Securityholders' Representative further agree, upon
request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Governmental



48



Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.



6.4 Transfer Taxes. Any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
("Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne 50% by
Evolent and 50% by the Securityholders (which fees the Securityholders'
Representative will cause to be paid to Evolent); provided, however, that any
Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the Reorganization (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any Transfer Taxes for which Valence Parent is liable
under the Reorganization Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A) or the
transfer of the equity interests of CHS Parent as part of the Merger
Consideration shall be borne by the Securityholders.



6.5 Tax Contests. Evolent, on the one hand, and the Securityholders'
Representative, on the other hand, shall notify each other within ten (10)
days of receipt by such party (or any Affiliate of such party) of written
notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with
respect to Taxes of Valence Parent relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period ("Tax
Contests"). Any failure to so notify the other party of any Tax Contest shall
not limit any of the indemnification obligations under Article IX (except to
the extent such failure materially prejudices the defense of such Tax
Contest). Such notice shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any
correspondence received from the relevant Taxing Authority and shall describe
in reasonable detail the nature of such Tax Contest to the extent known by
such party. Evolent and the Securityholders' Representative shall cooperate
with each other in the conduct of any Tax Contest. The Securityholders'
Representative shall have the right to control the conduct of all Tax
Contests, other than those that relate to a Straddle Period (a "Straddle
Period Tax Contest"); provided, the Securityholders' Representative shall keep
Evolent reasonably informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of
any such Tax Contest. Evolent shall have the right to control the conduct of
all Straddle Period Tax Contests; provided, Evolent shall keep the
Securityholders' Representative reasonably informed regarding the progress and
substantive aspects of any such Straddle Period Tax Contest. In each case, the
non-controlling party shall be entitled (at its own expense) to participate in
any such Tax Contest and the controlling party shall not compromise or settle
any such Tax Contest in a manner that would reasonably be expected to have an
adverse impact on any indemnification obligations under Article IX without the
non-controlling party's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Securityholders' Representative does
not elect to control the conduct of any Tax Contest, then Evolent shall keep
the Securityholders' Representative reasonably informed regarding the progress
and substantive aspects of such Tax Contest, and the Securityholders'
Representative shall be entitled to participate (at its own expense) in such
Tax Contest and Evolent shall not compromise or settle any such Tax Contest
without the Securityholders' Representative's written consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



6.6 Tax Refunds. Any Tax refund, credit or similar benefit (including any
interest paid or credited by a Taxing Authority with respect thereto) relating
to Valence Parent, net of applicable Taxes for any Tax period and any out-of-
pocket costs incurred by Evolent or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
such Tax refund or obtaining such Tax refund, relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (a "Tax Refund") shall be for the benefit of the Securityholders.
Evolent shall pay or cause to be paid the net amount of such Tax Refund in
cash to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Securityholders, within 15
days of receipt of such Tax Refund or the filing of any Tax Return utilizing
such Tax Refund (in the form of a credit or offset to Taxes otherwise
payable), as the case may be; provided that the cash shall be distributed to
the Securityholders at the direction of the Securityholders' Representative
(including, in its sole discretion, being held until the next scheduled
payment to the Securityholders under the terms of this Agreement). The parties
hereto agree that Tax Refunds for the portion of a Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date shall be determined using the methodologies set forth in
Section 6.2. Upon the request of the



49



Securityholders' Representative, Evolent shall promptly take (or cause to be
taken) all actions reasonably requested by the Securityholders' Representative
to file for and obtain any Tax Refund, to the extent the filing for such Tax
Refund does not increase any Taxes owed in a Post-Closing Tax Period or the
post-Closing portion of any Straddle Period.



6.7 Certain Actions. Except as set forth in Section 6.1(b) Without the written
consent of the Securityholders' Representative, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, neither Evolent nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall (i) file or amend (or cause to be filed or amended) any Tax
Return with respect to Valence Parent for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii)
make (or cause to be made) any Tax election with respect to Valence Parent for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (iii) initiate any communication with any
Governmental Authority regarding Taxes of Valence Parent with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period.



6.8 Reorganization Tax Treatment; Continuity of Business Enterprise.



(a)The Merger is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code, and this Agreement is intended to constitute a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3. Prior to the Closing, Valence Parent and Evolent shall
use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, and shall not take any action
independent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are
reasonably likely to cause the Merger to not so qualify. Neither Evolent nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall take any action after the Closing that would
reasonably be expected to cause the Merger not to qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Code unless otherwise required by a Taxing
Authority. None of the parties hereto will take any position on any Tax Return
that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization for
income Tax purposes. Evolent and its Subsidiaries shall comply with the record
keeping and information reporting requirements of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and notwithstanding any statement or
inference to the contrary in any other provision of this Agreement or any
other agreement contemplated by this Agreement, it is agreed that no party
shall be considered to have made any representation or warranty to any other
party as to the qualification of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.



(b)Evolent will continue at least one significant historic business line of
Valence Parent, or use at least a significant portion of the Valence Parent's
historic business assets in a business, in each case within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d), except that Evolent may transfer the
historic business assets of Valence Parent (i) to a corporation that is a
member of Evolent's "qualified group," within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii), or (ii) to a partnership if (A) one or
more members of Evolent's "qualified group" have active and substantial
management functions as a partner with respect to the historic business of
Valence Parent or (B) members of Evolent's "qualified group" in the aggregate
own an interest in the partnership representing a significant interest in the
historic business of Valence Parent, in each case within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(iii).



50





6.9 Transfer of Excluded Business.

(a)On or before the Closing Date, the Securityholders' Representative shall
cause to be prepared a valuation of the Excluded Business and the CHS Parent
shares following the Reorganization (collectively, the "Valuation"), which
shall be prepared in accordance with recognized valuation methodologies,
practices and customs and by a nationally recognized valuation firm. The fair
market value determined by the Valuation shall be the basis for determination
of gain or loss to Valence Parent (i) on the transfer of the Excluded Business
from Valence Parent to CHS pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A and (ii) on the
distribution of CHS Parent shares for U.S. federal, state and local income Tax
purposes and all parties hereto will use the fair market value determined by
the Valuation for such purpose to the greatest extent permitted by law.



(b)The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the transfer of the Excluded
Business from Valence Parent to CHS pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement,
attached hereto as Exhibit A, shall be treated as a taxable transfer for
federal income Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by the parties hereto
on their Tax Returns to the greatest extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements.



6.10 Coordination. In the event of any conflict or overlap between the
provisions of this Article VI and Article IX, the provisions of this Article
VI shall control.

the date such written notice is provided and the Termination Date.



8.2 Effect of Termination. Each party's right of termination under Section 8.1
is in addition to any other rights it may have under this Agreement or
otherwise, and the exercise of such right of termination will not be an
election of remedies. If the Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1,
all obligations of the parties under this Agreement will terminate, except
that the obligations under the Non-Disclosure Agreement, Section 5.7, this
Article VIII and Article X will survive; provided, however, that termination
of this Agreement will not preclude a party from bringing a claim against any
other party



54



to this Agreement for a breach arising prior to such termination pursuant to
the terms and conditions set forth herein; and, provided further, in the event
that all of the other conditions to the closing obligations of the Evolent
Entities set forth in Section 7.1 (other than with respect to the designated
condition set forth on Section 7.1(k) of the Disclosure Schedule) have been
satisfied and the Evolent Entities either terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(c) above or otherwise elect not to (or failure to) consummate the
Merger, Evolent shall pay Valence Parent an amount in cash equal to $6,000,000
within five (5) Business Days of the date of such termination or failure to
consummate the Merger.



ARTICLE IX

INDEMNIFICATION



9.1 Survival. All representations, warranties, covenants and obligations in
this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule attached hereto, and any other
certificate or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the
Closing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, subject
to Section 9.6. Subject to Section 5.5, the right to indemnification,
reimbursement, or other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations will not be affected by any investigation conducted
with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired)
about, the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.



9.2 Indemnification and Reimbursement of Evolent Indemnified Persons. From and
after the Closing, each Equityholder shall, severally in proportion to its pro

respective officers, directors, managers, stockholders, members,
representatives and agents (collectively, the "Evolent Indemnified Persons"),
and shall reimburse the Evolent Indemnified Persons for, any loss, liability,
claim, damage, expense (including costs of investigation and defense and

party claim (collectively, "Damages"), arising, directly or indirectly, from
or in connection with:

Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6(a)
(or any predecessor or successor thereof or any analogous or similar Legal
Requirement with respect to state or local Taxes) as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise, excluding customary Tax indemnification
provisions in commercial Contracts not primarily relating to Taxes;



(d)any brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or similar payments based
upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have been made by any Person
with Valence Parent or any of the Securityholders (or any Person acting on

55



(e)any incremental Damages (above the value of the Total Merger Consideration
otherwise due to such Securityholder) related to a notice or demand by any
Securityholder of such Securityholder's intent to exercise appraisal rights
under the DGCL, any exercise of appraisal rights by any Securityholder and all
appraisal Proceedings in connection therewith (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses and any other costs in connection therewith), and any
payments required to be made by the Surviving Entity or any Evolent
Indemnified Person in connection with any such exercise of appraisal rights;



(f)any other claims regarding the amount of Total Merger Consideration
received by any Equityholders or the allocation of Total Merger Consideration
among the Equityholders, or any other claims regarding the amount of Total
Merger Consideration received (or the absence of any Total Merger

or option, warrant or right to acquire any equity interest in any Valence
Entity as of the Effective Time; and



(g)any liability or obligation to the extent (i) relating to the Excluded
Business or (ii) arising under the Reorganization Agreement or relating to the
Reorganization or the other transactions contemplated thereby.



9.3 Indemnification and Reimbursement of the Securityholders. From and after
the Closing, Evolent and the Surviving Entity shall jointly and severally
indemnify and hold harmless the Securityholders and their respective
affiliates and direct and indirect partners (including partners of partners
and stockholders and members of partners), members, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, representatives and agents and each person who controls
any of them within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act (collectively, the "Securityholders Indemnified
Persons"), and shall reimburse the Securityholders Indemnified Persons for,
any Damages arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with:



(a)any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Evolent Entities
in this Agreement or any Evolent Closing Document, including any breach of any
such representation or warranty alleged by a third party;

in this Agreement or any Evolent Closing Document;

(e)any Third-Party Claim against the Valence Entities (other than Valence

56



9.4 Limitations and Qualifications on Indemnification of Evolent Indemnified
Persons. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the right of the Evolent Indemnified Persons to be indemnified, held harmless
and reimbursed pursuant to Section 9.2 is subject to the following limitations
and qualifications:



(a)The Evolent Indemnified Persons shall have no right to recover any amounts
under Section 9.2(a) until the total amount of Damages incurred by the Evolent
Indemnified Persons under Section 9.2(a) exceeds $1,250,000 (the "Basket"), in
which case the Evolent Indemnified Persons will be entitled to recover the
full amount of the Damages, including the Basket.



(b)The maximum amount of Damages that may be recovered by the Evolent
Indemnified Persons under Section 9.2(a) will be an amount equal to the Escrow
Consideration (the "Cap").



(c)The limitations set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 9.4 shall
not apply to breaches of Fundamental Representations or claims for
indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.2(b) through 9.2(h). Subject to Section
9.4(d) below, the maximum amount of Damages that may be recovered by the
Evolent Indemnified Persons (i) based on a breach of any Fundamental
Representations or (ii) pursuant to Sections 9.2(b) through 9.2(h), inclusive,
shall be the Merger Consideration.



(d)Subject to any applicable limitation set forth herein, nothing contained
herein (including Section 9.4(a), Section 9.4(b) and Section 9.6(a)) shall
limit or restrict any Evolent Indemnified Person's right to maintain or
recover any amounts in connection with any action or claim based upon any
fraud or intentional misrepresentation.



(e)During the term of the Escrow Agreement (exclusive of any extension thereof
past its regular term which occurs solely as a result of a claim being made
thereunder, other than with respect to such claim), the Evolent Indemnified
Persons' first recourse with respect to any indemnity claim asserted under
Section 9.2 shall be to collect from and against the then outstanding Escrowed
Consideration held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement at the time
of such claim; provided, however, if the then outstanding Escrowed
Consideration held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement at such time
is insufficient to satisfy any amount owing to the Evolent Indemnified Persons
(or the Escrowed Consideration otherwise has been released), then the Evolent
Indemnified Persons' second recourse with respect to any such indemnity claim
asserted under Section 9.2 shall be to withhold and set-off any amount to
which the Evolent Indemnified Persons are entitled under this Article IX
against any Earnout Amount as provided for in Section 9.7, to the extent that
any Earnout Amount is due and payable at the time any such claims remain
outstanding; and, provided further, that if the then outstanding Escrowed
Consideration held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement at such time
is insufficient to satisfy any amount owing to the Evolent Indemnified Persons
(or the Escrowed Consideration otherwise has been released) and there is not
any Earnout Amount due and payable at the time any such claims remain
outstanding (or to the extent that any such claims that are outstanding exceed
any Earnout Amount that is due and payable at the time any such claims are
outstanding), the Evolent Indemnified Persons may bring a claim against the
Equityholders for such amount in accordance with the first paragraph of
Section 9.2.



(f)The Evolent Indemnified Persons shall have no right to recover any amounts
under Section 9.2(a) for any individual item or series of related items where
the Damages with respect to such item or related items are less than $10,000.



(g)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Evolent Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX for
any Damages resulting from, or relating or attributable to, any Tax attribute
of Valence Parent, including but not limited to any net operating loss,



57



any net operating loss carryover, any Tax credit, any Tax credit carryover or
any other Tax attribute of Valence Parent which may be affected in any way by
the acquisition of control under applicable Law, or the determination that any
such Tax attribute is subject to any limitation on its use under applicable
Law.



9.5 Limitations and Qualifications on Indemnification of the Securityholders
Indemnified Persons. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the right of the Securityholders Indemnified Persons to be
indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed pursuant to Section 9.3 is subject
to the following limitations and qualifications:



(a)The Securityholders Indemnified Persons shall have no right to recover any
amounts under Section 9.3(a) until the total amount of Damages incurred by the
Securityholders Indemnified Persons under Section 9.3(a) exceeds the Basket,
in which case the Securityholders Indemnified Persons will be entitled to
recover the full amount of the Damages, including the Basket.



(b)The maximum amount of Damages that may be recovered by the Securityholders
Indemnified Persons under Section 9.3(a) will be the Cap.



(c)The limitations set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 9.5 shall
not apply to breaches of Fundamental Representations or claims for
indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.3(b) or 9.3(c). Subject to Section
9.5(d) below, the maximum amount of Damages that may be recovered by the
Securityholders Indemnified Persons (i) based on a breach of any Fundamental
Representations or (ii) pursuant to Sections 9.3(b) or 9.3(c), shall be the
Merger Consideration.



(d)Nothing contained herein (including Section 9.5(a), Section 9.5(b) and
Section 9.6(b)) shall limit or restrict the Securityholders' Representative,
on behalf of the Securityholders Indemnified Persons, to maintain or recover
any amounts in connection with any action or claim based upon any fraud or
intentional misrepresentation.



9.6 Time Limitations.

(a)The Evolent Indemnified Persons shall have no right to recover any amounts
under Section 9.2(a), unless on or before the date that is fifteen (15) months
following the Closing Date, Evolent notifies the Securityholders'
Representative in writing of a claim or breach under Section 9.2(a)
specifying, to the extent then known by Evolent, the factual basis of that
claim or breach in reasonable detail; provided, however, that any written
notice of any claim or breach with respect to any Fundamental Representation
(other than Section 3.7(Taxes)), or a claim for indemnification or
reimbursement to the extent not arising under Sections 9.2(a), may be made by
Evolent until such time that it is not permissible to bring such claim
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements (it being understood that such
claims survive indefinitely to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements); and, provided further, that claims under Section 9.2(b)
for any covenants or obligations of Valence Parent or the Securityholders'
Representative contained in this Agreement or any Valence Closing Document
that by their nature are required to be performed by or prior to the Closing
shall survive until the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date; and, provided further, that any written notice of any claim or breach
with respect to Section 3.7 (Taxes) or Section 9.2(c) may be made at any time
prior to 60 days after the last day of the applicable statute of limitations
period for any claim relating to the Taxes which are the subject of the claim
or breach with respect to Section 3.7(Taxes) or Section 9.2(c) (taking into
account any extension or waiver thereof).



(b)The Securityholders Indemnified Persons shall have no right to recover any
amounts under Section 9.3(a), unless on or before the date that is fifteen
(15) months following the Closing Date, the Securityholders' Representative
notifies Evolent in writing of a claim or breach under Section



58



9.3(a) specifying, to the extent then known by the Securityholders'
Representative, the factual basis of that claim or breach in reasonable
detail; provided, however, that any written notice of any claim or breach with
respect to Fundamental Representations, or a claim for indemnification or
reimbursement to the extent not arising under Section 9.3(a), may be made by
the Securityholders' Representative until such time that it is not permissible
to bring such claim pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements; and, provided
further, that claims under Section 9.3(b) for any covenants or obligations of
the Evolent Entities contained in this Agreement or any Evolent Closing
Document that by their nature are required to be performed by or prior to the
Closing shall survive until the date that is twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date.



9.7 Right of Setoff. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, but subject to Section 9.4(e), upon written notice to the
Securityholders' Representative specifying in reasonable detail the basis for
such set-off, an Evolent Indemnified Person may set off any amount to which it
is entitled under this Article IX against any Earnout Amount otherwise payable
by Evolent pursuant to the terms set forth herein. Neither the exercise of nor
the failure to exercise such right of set-off will constitute an election of
remedies or limit Evolent in any manner in the enforcement of any other
remedies that may be available to it.



9.8 Third-Party Claims.

(a)In the event that a claim is made by a third party (a "Third-Party Claim")
against any Person in connection with which any Person is (or is anticipated
to be) entitled to indemnity under Section 9.2 or Section 9.3 (an "Indemnified
Person"; any Person required to provide indemnity under this Agreement is
referred to as an "Indemnifying Person"), then, (i) in the case of any claim
under Section 9.2, Evolent shall provide notice to the Securityholders'
Representative, and (ii) in the case of any claim under Section 9.3, the
Securityholders' Representative shall provide notice to Evolent, in each such
case promptly following the assertion of such Third-Party Claim (or, if later,
the time at which such Third-Party Claim is anticipated to give rise to any
indemnification obligations under this Agreement); provided that the failure
to provide such notice will not relieve any Indemnifying Person of any
liability that it may have to any Indemnified Person, except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Person demonstrates that the defense of such Third-Party
Claim is prejudiced by the Indemnified Person's failure to give such notice.



(b)If an Indemnified Person gives notice pursuant to Section 9.8(a) of the
assertion of a Third-Party Claim in connection with which any Indemnified
Person is (or is anticipated to be) entitled to indemnity under Section 9.2 or
Section 9.3, as applicable, the Indemnifying Person shall, at its sole cost
and expense, be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party
Claim and, to the extent that it wishes, to assume the defense of such Third-
Party Claim with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. After notice
from the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person of its election to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall
not, so long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the
Indemnified Person under this Article IX for any fees or expenses related to
the defense of such Third-Party Claim of other counsel engaged by the
Indemnified Person to participate in the defense thereof, in each case
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense
of such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, (i) such assumption will conclusively establish for
purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Third-Party Claim are
within the scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no compromise or
settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be effected by the Indemnifying
Person without the Indemnified Person's consent, not to be unreasonably
withheld, unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of any
Legal Requirement or any violation of the rights of any Person, and (B) the
sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Person and such compromise or settlement includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Person; and (iii) the Indemnified
Person shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of
such Third-Party Claims effected



59



without its consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Person of any
Third-Party Claim in accordance with the first sentence of this Section
9.8(b), and the Indemnifying Person does not, within ten (10) Business Days
after the Indemnified Person's notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified
Person of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Person may defend the claim and to the extent indemnifiable, will
be reimbursed for the costs and expenses of such counsel; provided, that any
compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Person shall require the
consent of the Indemnifying Person, not to be unreasonably withheld, unless
there is no finding or admission of any violation of any Legal Requirement or
any violation of the rights of any Person and the sole relief provided is
monetary damages.



(c)Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) an Indemnified Person reasonably
determines that it is likely that a Third-Party Claim may adversely affect it
or its Affiliates in any material respect other than as a result of monetary
damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, (ii) the Indemnifying Person is also a Person against whom the
Third-Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Person reasonably determines
that joint representation would be inappropriate, (iii) the Indemnifying
Person fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Person of its
financial capacity to defend such Third-Party Claim and provide
indemnification with respect to such Third-Party Claim, or (iv) the aggregate
amount of potential Damages relating to such Third-Party Claim could, in the
reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Person, exceed the then-unused portion
of the Cap (in the event that the limitation of the Cap applies to such Third-
Party Claim), the Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying
Person, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Third-
Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Person will not be bound by any
determination of any Third-Party Claim so defended for the purposes of this
Agreement or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which
may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).



(d)If the Indemnifying Person undertakes the defense of a Third-Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Person may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost
and expense but shall not be entitled to any reimbursement with respect
thereto; provided, however, that if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to
the Indemnified Person, (i) there are legal defenses available to the
Indemnified Person that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Person or (ii) there exists a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Person shall be liable for (as Damages hereunder) the reasonable
and documented fees and expenses of one separate counsel to the Indemnified
Person.



(e)With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this
Article IX: (i) both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person, as
the case may be, shall keep the other Person fully informed in all material
respects of the status of such Third-Party Claim and any related Proceedings
at all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel,
and (ii) the parties agree to render to each other such assistance as they may
reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each
other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party
Claim.



60





9.9 Procedure for Indemnification - Other Claims. A claim for indemnification
for any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim may be asserted by (i) in the
case of any claim by any Evolent Indemnified Persons under Section 9.2, notice
to the Securityholders' Representative, and (ii) in the case of any claim by
any Securityholders under Section 9.3, written notice by the Securityholders'
Representative to Evolent.



9.10 Exclusive Remedy. Except for a claim for Damages described in Section
9.4(d) or 9.5(d), the indemnification provided for in this Article IX shall be
the exclusive post-Closing remedy available to an Indemnified Person in
connection with any breach of this Agreement and/or any Damages arising out of
the matters set forth in this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that nothing herein will limit any Indemnified
Person's rights hereunder or otherwise to injunctive or other equitable relief
to enforce its rights under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
limit or restrict any Person who is a party to any agreement entered at
Closing (other than the Escrow Agreement, the remedies under which will be
governed by the terms hereof and thereof) to obtain Damages or any other legal
or equitable relief from any other Person who is a party to any such agreement
in connection with the breach of such agreement by such other Person pursuant
to the terms thereof.



9.11 Calculation of Damages.

(a)For purposes of calculating the amount of Damages to which the Evolent
Indemnified Persons or the Securityholders Indemnified Persons are entitled
under this Article IX, the terms "material," "materiality," and "Material
Adverse Effect" will be disregarded.



(b)For purposes of calculating the amount of Damages to which the Evolent
Indemnified Persons are entitled under this Article IX, (i) such Damages shall
not include (A) amounts constituting exemplar or punitive damages, (B)
diminution in value of any business, damage to reputation or loss of goodwill,
or (C) any damages calculated based on a multiple of profits, revenue or any
other financial metric, except in each case to the extent awarded and paid to
a third party in connection with a Third-Party Claim; (ii) such Damages shall
be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such Damages constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement; (iii) such Damages shall not
include losses to the extent taken into account (including with respect to any
reserves) as a reduction in Merger Consideration in the determination of the
Final Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section 2.11; (iv) such Damages shall not
include Taxes to the extent such Taxes were included in the determination of
Final Closing Date Net Working Capital; (v) such Damages shall be reduced by
the amount of any proceeds that any Evolent Indemnified Person actually
receives pursuant to the terms of any insurance policies, less any costs
incurred in recovering such amount; (vi) such Damages shall be reduced by the
amount of any prior or subsequent recovery by an Evolent Indemnified Person
from any other Person with respect to such Damages, less any costs incurred in
recovering such amount; and (vii) such Damages may include any lost profits
(excluding any multiple of lost profits), consequential, indirect or
incidental damages and any loss of enterprise value (excluding any multiples
of loss or diminution in value).



(c)For purposes of calculating Damages to which the Securityholders
Indemnified Persons are entitled under this Article IX, (i) such Losses shall
not include any punitive damages, except to the extent awarded and paid to a
third party in connection with a Third-Party Claim; (ii) such Damages shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such Damages constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement; (iii) such Damages shall be
reduced by the amount of any proceeds that any Securityholders Indemnified
Person



61



actually receives pursuant to the terms of any insurance policies, less any
costs incurred in recovering such amount; and (iv) such Damages shall be
reduced by the amount of any prior or subsequent recovery by a Securityholders
Indemnified Person from any other Person with respect to such Damages, less
any costs incurred in recovering such amount.



(d)Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
Article IX, for purposes of computing the amount of any Damages incurred by
any Indemnified Person under this Article IX, there shall be deducted an
amount equal to the amount of any Tax benefit reasonably expected to be
realized by the Indemnified Person in the Tax year in which the Indemnified
Person receives the payment for Damages (or any prior Tax year) in connection
with such Damages or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto. In
computing the amount of any such Tax benefit, the Indemnified Person shall be
deemed to recognize any item of loss, deduction or credit as a result of such
indemnified Damages prior to the recognition of any other items of loss,
deduction or credit.



9.12 Mitigation of Damages. The Evolent Indemnified Persons and
Securityholders Indemnified Persons shall take, and cause their respective
Affiliates to take, reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages for which they
are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX, to the extent it
is reasonably feasible to do so, upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto.



9.13 Escrow Payments; Treatment of Indemnification Payments.



(a)Shares of Evolent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund and used to satisfy
an indemnification claim made by the Evolent Indemnified Persons under this
Agreement shall be valued on the date such indemnification claim is satisfied
(based on the Valuation Methodology).



(b)Any payments made pursuant to the indemnification obligations arising under
this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration
for all Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by the parties hereto on
their Tax Returns to the greatest extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements.



9.14 Release of Escrow Fund. While the specific provisions relating to
distribution and release of the Escrow Fund shall be set forth in the Escrow
Agreement, it is understood and agreed that subject to the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement, on the first Business Day following the
date that is fifteen (15) months from the Closing Date (the "Escrow Release
Date"), there shall be automatically released from the Escrow Fund and
delivered to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Equityholders, an amount
equal to the following: (i) the amount of the Escrow Fund remaining in escrow
as of the Escrow Release Date, minus (ii) the sum of all amounts, if any, that
as of the Escrow Release Date are required to be retained in the Escrow Fund
to secure satisfaction of then-pending indemnification claims pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement.

10.4 Entire Agreement; Modification. This Agreement (together with the
Annexes, Schedules and Exhibits attached to this Agreement and the other
documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement) constitutes the entire
agreement among the parties and supersedes all prior agreements, whether
written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof (including the Non-Disclosure Agreement which will be of no
further force and effect, effective as of the Closing). This Agreement may not
be amended except by a written agreement signed by Evolent and the
Securityholders' Representative.



10.5 Waiver. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any
right under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will
operate as a waiver of such right, and no single or partial exercise of any
such right will preclude any other or further exercise of such right or the
exercise of any other right. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in
whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in
writing signed by (i) in the case of any waiver requested by the Evolent
Entities prior to or at the Closing, by Valence Parent, or in the case of any
waiver requested by Evolent following the Closing, the Securityholders'
Representative, and (ii) in the case of any waiver requested by Valence Parent
or the Securityholders' Representative, the Evolent Entities; (b) no waiver
that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific
instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party
will be deemed



64



to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party
giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand
as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.
The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and
not alternative.



10.6 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be ineffective to the
extent of such invalidity or unenforceability; provided, however, that the
remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect without being
impaired or invalidated in any way unless such invalid or unenforceable
provision or clause is so significant as to materially affect the expectations
of the parties regarding this Agreement. Otherwise, any invalid or
unenforceable provision shall be replaced by Evolent and the Securityholders'
Representative with a valid provision which most closely approximates the
intent and economic effect of the invalid or unenforceable provision.



10.7 Headings; Construction. The headings of Articles and Sections in this
Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its
construction or interpretation. All Annexes, Exhibits and Schedules to this
Agreement are incorporated into and constitute an integral part of this
Agreement as if fully set forth herein. All words used in this Agreement will
be construed to be of such gender or number as the context requires. Any
disclosure made by a party in the Disclosure Schedule with reference to any
section or schedule shall be deemed to be a disclosure with respect to all
other sections or schedules to which the relevance of such disclosure is
reasonably apparent on its face. The disclosure of any information shall not
be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such information is required to
be disclosed in connection with the representations and warranties made in
this Agreement, nor shall such information be deemed to establish a standard
of materiality. The words "including," "include" or words of similar import
shall be deemed to be followed by "without limitation" and otherwise shall be
considered illustrative and non-limiting. The language used in this Agreement
will be construed, in all cases, according to its fair meaning, and not for or
against any party hereto. The parties acknowledge that each party has reviewed
this Agreement and that rules of construction to the effect that any
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party will not be
available in the interpretation of this Agreement.



10.8 Governing Law. This Agreement, and any claims that arise out of or result
from this Agreement, will be governed by and construed under the laws of the
State of Delaware without regard to any conflicts of laws principles that
would require the application of any other law.



10.9 Execution of Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
separate counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of
this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of copies of this
Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile, or by .pdf or similar imaging
transmission, will constitute effective execution and delivery of this
Agreement as to the parties and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement
for all purposes. Signatures of the parties transmitted by facsimile, or by
.pdf or similar imaging transmission, will be deemed to be their original
signatures for any purpose whatsoever.



10.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY PERTAINING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, WHETHER NOW OR
HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE. ANY
PARTY MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS SECTION 10.10 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE
OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY, AND THAT ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION WHATSOEVER
BETWEEN THE PARTIES RELATING



65



TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY WILL INSTEAD BE
TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.



10.11 Specific Enforcement. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other
party(ies) would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms, and
that any breach of this Agreement could not be adequately compensated by
monetary damages. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to any
other right or remedy to which the non-breaching party may be entitled, at law
or in equity, the non-breaching party will be entitled to enforce any
provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to
temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of the provisions of this Agreement, without posting any
bond or other undertaking.



10.12 Securityholders' Representative.



(a)Each Securityholder, pursuant to the terms of the Letter of Transmittal to
be entered into by such Securityholder, has designated and appointed North
Bridge and Philip Kamp, jointly as the Securityholders' Representative and as
exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of each Securityholder,
with full power and authority in each of the Securityholders' names, to give
and receive notices and communications, to agree to, negotiate and enter into,
on behalf of each such Securityholder, amendments, consents and waivers under
this Agreement or any Valence Closing Document pursuant to the terms set forth
herein and therein, to make and receive payments on behalf of the
Securityholder pursuant to the terms set forth herein, to take such other
actions as authorized by this Agreement, including actions in connection with
the determination of the Final Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section 2.11
hereof and the Earnout Amount, the defense and/or settlement of any
indemnification claims of any Evolent Indemnified Person pursuant to Article
IX, to take all actions authorized by the Escrow Agreement, including
defending or settling any claims thereunder and releasing and transferring any
of the Escrow Fund to Evolent in accordance with the terms set forth therein,
and all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Securityholders' Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing;
provided, however, that the Securityholders' Representative shall have no
obligation to act, except as expressly provided herein. All such actions of
the Securityholders' Representative shall be binding on the Securityholders as
if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them, and no
Securityholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise
contest the same. Such agency may be changed by a vote or written consent by
the holders of a majority of the Shares on an as-converted basis as of the
Closing Date, voting in the same manner as would have been voted in accordance
with the Organizational Documents of Valence Parent as in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date (the "Majority Holders"), from time to time upon not
less than ten (10) days' prior written notice to Evolent. If at any time the
Securityholders' Representative resigns, dies or becomes incapable of acting,
the Majority Holders shall appoint another Person to act as the
Securityholders' Representative under this Agreement and immediately
thereafter notify Evolent of the identity of such successor. Each successor
Securityholders' Representative shall have all of the power, authority, rights
and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the original Securityholders'
Representative, and the term "Securityholders' Representative" as used herein
shall be deemed to include any interim or successor Securityholders'
Representative. The Securityholders may not make a claim for indemnity against
Evolent pursuant to this Agreement except through the Securityholders'
Representative, who shall make such a claim only upon the written direction of
the Majority Holders. The Securityholders' Representative shall have
reasonable access to relevant information about Valence Parent and a
reasonable opportunity to consult with employees of Valence Parent solely for
purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder,
provided that the Securityholders' Representative shall treat confidentially
and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about Valence Parent to
anyone except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such
information confidentially.



66





(b)Once the Securityholders' Representative has initiated a claim for
indemnity, all acts and decisions of the Securityholders' Representative in
connection with such matter shall be binding on all of the Securityholders. No
bond shall be required of the Securityholders' Representative, and the
Securityholders' Representative shall receive no compensation for services
provided hereunder. Notices or communications to or from the Securityholders'
Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the Securityholders.



(c)The Securityholders' Representative will be entitled to engage such
counsel, experts and other agents as the Securityholders' Representative deems
necessary or proper in connection with performing the Securityholders'
Representative's obligations hereunder, and will be promptly reimbursed by the
Securityholders for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances
incurred by the Securityholders' Representative in such capacity upon demand.
The Securityholders shall severally indemnify and hold harmless the
Securityholders' Representative with respect to any and all Damages that are
incurred by the Securityholders' Representative as a result of actions taken,
or actions not taken, by the Securityholders' Representative hereunder, except
to the extent that such Damages arise from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Securityholders' Representative. The Securityholders'
Representative shall not be liable to the Securityholders for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Securityholders' Representative, excluding acts which
constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct.



(d)The Securityholders' Representative shall be entitled to withdraw cash
amounts held in the Securityholders' Representative Expense Fund for the
reimbursement of out of pocket fees and expenses (including legal, accounting,
and other advisors' fees and expenses, if applicable) incurred by the
Securityholders' Representative in performing under this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents contemplated hereby. The Securityholders'
Representative Expense Fund shall be held by the Securityholders'
Representative in a segregated client bank account. The Securityholders shall
earn no interest on the Securityholders' Representative Expense Fund. The
Securityholders acknowledge that the Securityholders' Representative is not
providing any investment supervision, recommendations, or advice. The
Securityholders' Representative shall have no responsibility or liability for
any loss of principal of the Securityholders' Representative Expense Fund
other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. Any and
all amounts in the Securityholders' Representative Expense Fund shall
otherwise remain in the Securityholders' Representative Expense Fund until the
date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date (or such longer
time as a claim made during the applicable survival period remains
outstanding). After such time, the Securityholders' Representative shall
distribute any remaining portion of the Securityholders' Representative
Expense Fund to the Securityholders based on such Securityholders' pro rata
portion of the Securityholders' Representative Expense Fund as set forth in
the Waterfall. In the event the fees and expenses incurred by the
Securityholders' Representative in performing its duties under this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents contemplated hereby exceed the
Securityholders' Representative Expense Fund, the excess amount shall be the
responsibility of the Securityholders, pro rata based on each Securityholder's
respective share of the Total Merger Consideration as set forth in the
Waterfall, pursuant to this Section 10.12 (which, to the extent of any funds
from the Escrow Fund released to the Securityholders' Representative, shall
first be paid from such released funds). For Tax purposes, the
Securityholders' Representative Expense Fund shall be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Securityholders at the Closing.



(e)This appointment and grant of power and authority is binding upon the
Securityholders and their respective executors, heirs, legal representatives
and successors and is coupled with an interest and is in consideration of the
mutual covenants made herein and is irrevocable and shall not be terminated by
any act of any of the Securityholders (except as otherwise provided herein) or
by operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of any Securityholders
or by the occurrence of any



67



other event. Each Securityholder hereby renounces his, her or its right to
renounce this power of attorney unilaterally before the complete distribution
of the Merger Consideration, the Escrowed Consideration and the Earnout Amount
(if any). Each Securityholder hereby waives any and all defenses that may be
available to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Securityholders'
Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholders'
Representative in respect of any action under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement shall constitute a decision of all of the Securityholders, shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon the Securityholders, and the Evolent
Entities may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholders' Representative hereunder as being the decision, act, consent
or instruction of each and every such Securityholder. The Evolent Entities
shall be able to rely conclusively on the proper distribution of such amounts
by the Securityholders' Representative among the Securityholders upon receipt
by the Securityholders' Representative of such amounts. The Evolent Entities
are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person (including any
Securityholders) for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Securityholders' Representative, to the
extent delegated to the Securityholders' Representative hereunder.



(f)The provisions of this Section 10.12 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Person may have in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby.



10.13 Waiver of Privilege and Conflicts; Valence Parent Emails.



(a)Acknowledgment of Prior Representation. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that each of Latham and Watkins LLP and Weil, Gotshal and
Manges LLP (collectively, "Valence Counsel") has acted as counsel to one or
more of Valence Parent, Valence Parent's Subsidiaries, the Securityholders'
Representative and/or the Securityholders in connection with various matters,
including, but not limited to, disputes and negotiations with Evolent, and/or
the negotiation of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.



(b)Consent to Future Representation. Each of Evolent and its Subsidiaries (for
the avoidance of doubt, including Merger Sub in each case) hereby consents and
agrees to, and agrees to cause Evolent, the Surviving Entity and the Surviving
Entity's Subsidiaries to consent and agree to, Valence Counsel, or any of
Valence Counsel, representing the Securityholders' Representative and/or any
or all of the Securityholders (collectively, the "Seller Parties") after the
Closing with respect to all work performed on behalf of any Seller Party or
Valence Entity prior to the Closing and disputes arising out of or related to
this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (the "Future Representation"), in
which the interests of the Seller Parties may be directly adverse to Evolent
and its Subsidiaries (including, but not limited to, Evolent, Valence Parent
and Valence Parent's Subsidiaries), and even though Valence Counsel, or any of
Valence Counsel, may have represented Evolent, Valence Parent or Valence
Parent's Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to any such dispute.
Each of Evolent and its Subsidiaries further consents and agrees to, and
agrees to cause Evolent and its Subsidiaries, Valence Parent and Valence
Parent's Subsidiaries to consent and agree to, the communication by Valence
Counsel, or any of Valence Counsel, to the Seller Parties in connection with
any such representation of any fact known to Valence Counsel, or any of
Valence Counsel, arising by reason of Valence Counsel, or any of Valence
Counsel's prior representation of Valence Parent and Valence Parent's
Subsidiaries and/or the Seller Parties.



(c)Waiver of Conflicts. In connection with the foregoing, each of Evolent and
its Subsidiaries hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, and
agrees to cause Evolent, Valence Parent and Valence Parent's Subsidiaries to
irrevocably waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest



68



arising from or in connection with (i) Valence Counsel, or any of Valence
Counsel's prior representation of Valence Parent and Valence Parent's
Subsidiaries and/or the Seller Parties and (ii) Valence Counsel, or any of
Valence Counsel's representation of the Securityholders' Representative and
the Securityholders prior to and after the Closing, in each case with respect
to the Future Representation. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision hereof, no conflict of interest or any objection is waived arising
from any representation other than solely representation of the Valence
Entities and the Seller Parties prior to Closing.



(d)Definition and Ownership of Seller Communications. Each of Evolent and its
Subsidiaries further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of Evolent, Valence Parent and Valence Parent Subsidiaries,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including but not
limited to, Sections 1.3 or 5.1 or the DGCL, including but not limited to,
DGCL Section 259, that all communications in any form or format whatsoever
between or among any of Valence Counsel, or any of Valence Counsel, Evolent,
Valence Parent, Valence Parent's Subsidiaries, the Securityholders'
Representative and/or any Seller, or any of their respective present or former
directors, officers employees or other representatives that relate in any way
to disputes and negotiations with Evolent, and/or the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, the
"Seller Communications") shall be deemed to be retained and owned collectively
by the Securityholders, shall be controlled by the Securityholders'
Representative or such other representative or representatives as may be
selected and appointed by the Securityholders (the "Seller Communications
Representative") on behalf of the Securityholders and shall not pass to or be
claimed by Evolent or any of its Subsidiaries, Valence Parent or any of
Valence Parent's Subsidiaries. All Seller Communications that are attorney-
client privileged (the "Privileged Seller Communications") shall remain
privileged after the Closing and the privilege and the expectation of client
confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the Seller Communications
Representative and the Securityholders, shall be maintained and controlled by
the Seller Communications Representative on behalf of the Securityholders and
shall not pass to or be claimed by Evolent or any of its Subsidiaries, Valence
Parent or any of Valence Parent's Subsidiaries.



(e)Exclusions for Third Party Claims and Legally Required Disclosure.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Evolent or any of its Subsidiaries, Valence Parent or Valence Parent's
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third party other than the
Securityholders' Representative or a Securityholder, on the other hand,
Evolent or any of its Subsidiaries, Valence Parent or Valence Parent's
Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the
disclosure of the Privileged Seller Communications to such third party;
provided, however, that none of Evolent or any of its Subsidiaries, Valence
Parent or Valence Parent's Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of the Seller Communications Representative. In the
event that Evolent or any of its Subsidiaries, Valence Parent or any of
Valence Parent's Subsidiaries is legally required by governmental order or
otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Seller
Communications, Evolent and any its Subsidiaries shall immediately (and, in
any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the Seller Communications
Representative in writing (including by making specific reference to this
Section) so that the Seller Communications Representative can seek a
protective order and Evolent and any its Subsidiaries agree to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to assist therewith.



(f)No Duty to Disclose Seller Communications. To the extent that files or
other materials maintained by Valence Counsel, or any of Valence Counsel,
constitute Privileged Seller Communications, only the Securityholders shall
hold such Privileged Seller Communications and Valence Counsel, or any of
Valence Counsel, shall have no duty to reveal or disclose any such files or
other materials or any Seller Communications by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Valence Counsel, or any of Valence Counsel, on the one
hand, and Evolent, Valence Parent or Valence Parent's Subsidiaries, on the
other hand.



69





(g)Right to Protect/Remove Seller Communications. It shall not be a breach of
any provision of this Agreement if prior to the Closing Valence Parent,
Valence Parent's Subsidiaries, the Securityholders' Representative and/or any
Securityholder, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
other representatives takes any action to protect from access or remove from
the premises of Valence Parent or Valence Parent's Subsidiaries (or any
server, computer storage device, cloud, offsite back-up or other facilities)
any Seller Communications, including without limitation by segregating,
encrypting, copying, deleting, erasing, exporting or otherwise taking
possession of any Seller Communications (any such action, a "Permitted
Removal"). In accordance with this Section 10.13, and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to Closing, Valence Parent may sell,
give or otherwise transfer to Valence Parent employees, officers or directors
any Valence Parent laptops, PDA's, cellular phones, or similar devices
provided by Valence Parent for use by any such employee or director.
