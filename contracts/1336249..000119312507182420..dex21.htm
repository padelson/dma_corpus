($175,000,000), comprised of the following:

(a) An amount in cash and Parent Shares payable by Buyer to Seller at the

\- 11 -  EBITDA or the Interim Governing EBITDA Income Statement and the calculation
of Interim Governing EBITDA, as applicable, at least five (5) days prior
to the Closing Date. The Closing Payment will be comprised of: (x) the number
of Parent Shares having a value equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Closing
Payment less Two Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($2,750,000),
such number of Parent Shares to be determined based upon a per share price in
an amount equal to (i) the value of the Trust Account as of Parents fiscal
quarter ending prior to the Closing Date, divided by (ii) 14,375,000 (the "
_Share Consideration_ "), and (y) an amount in cash equal to eighty percent
(80%) of the Closing Payment plus Two Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($2,750,000) (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), _provided_ that Two
Million Dollars ($2,000,000) of such Cash Consideration (the " _Seller Escrow
Amount_ ") shall not be paid by Buyer to Seller at the Closing but shall be
deposited by Buyer with the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 2.10_ hereof;
and

(b) Such amounts as are payable pursuant to _Section 2.3_ hereof.

Section 2.3 _Earn Out_. As additional consideration for the Deep South
Interests and the Assigned Interests, Parent agrees to pay to Seller
an additional amount as provided in Section 2.3(a) and Section 2.3(b) (the "
_Earn Out_ "), payable in two (2) installments in cash, or at the election of
Seller in Parent Shares (subject to applicable securities Laws),
each installment determined in the manner set forth herein and payable in the
manner and at the times set forth herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
sum of the Closing Payment and the Earn Out shall not exceed One Hundred
Seventy-Five Million Dollars ($175,000,000).

(a) _First Earn Out Payment_.

(i) _Calculation_. By the first Business Day after the earlier of the date
that Parent files, or is required to file, with the SEC its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the twelve months ending on December 31, 2008 (the " _First Earn
Out Period_ "), Parent shall cause to be prepared (1) an audited consolidated
income statement of the Companies covering the First Earn Out Period,
prepared consistent with past practice and in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied and used in the preparation of the Governing EBITDA
Income Statement, audited by Parents auditors (the fees and expenses of which
shall be paid by Parent), adjusted as set forth on _Schedule 1.1(a)(i)_ , and
(2) a calculation of an Earn Out payment based on such consolidated income
statement (the " _First Earn Out Payment_ "), as follows:



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

First Earn Out Payment =

 |  | [(First Adjusted EBITDA  First Base EBITDA) ÷ (First Hurdle EBITDA 
First Base EBITDA)] × [($175,000,000  Closing Payment) ÷ 2]; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the First Earn Out Payment (i) shall be $0 if First Adjusted
EBITDA is less than First Base EBITDA, and (ii) shall not exceed an amount
equal to ($175,000,000  Closing Payment) ÷ 2, 
   | 
  

Where:

 |  | 
   | 
  

First Adjusted EBITDA =

 |  | Adjusted EBITDA of the Companies for the First Earn Out Period. 
 



 

\- 12 - ---|---|--- 
   | 
  

First Base EBITDA =

 |  | 0.93 × Governing EBITDA. 
   | 
  

First Hurdle EBITDA =

 |  | 1.25 × Governing EBITDA. 
   | 
  

EBITDA =

 |  | an amount equal to (1) pre-tax net income, plus (2) interest expense,
plus (3) depreciation and amortization expense. 
   | 
  

Adjusted EBITDA =

 |  | EBITDA adjusted to exclude for each Earn Out Period (1) any impact
from purchase accounting adjustments; (2) the first One Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) of the costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the operation of Parent; (3) the fees and expenses described
on _Schedule 2.3(a)(i)_ ; and (4) any revenues and expenses associated with
business operations not conducted by the Companies at the time of the
Closing, including, without limitation, any expansion of the business
operations into new jurisdictions or in a manner not contemplated by Sellers
business plan attached hereto as _Schedule 2.3(a)(i)_ and as amended from
time to time (" _Seller s Business Plan_") at the time of the execution of
this Agreement (any determination to exclude revenues and expenses described
in this clause (4) shall be subject to approval by the Parent Board).  
 

By way of illustration, assuming that Governing EBITDA is $18,000,000 and
First Adjusted EBITDA is $22,000,000, then the First Earn Out Payment will be
calculated as follows:



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

First Earn Out Payment =

 |  | [($22,000,000  (0.93 × $18,000,000)) ÷ ((1.25 × $18,000,000)  (0.93
× $18,000,000))] × [($175,000,000  $106,920,000) ÷ 2] = $31,085,139  
 

(ii) _Delivery to Seller_. By the first Business Day after the earlier of
the date that Parent files, or is required to file, with the SEC its Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ending on December 31, 2008, Parent
will cause to be delivered to Seller the audited consolidated income statement
upon which the calculation of the First Earn Out Payment is based and the
calculation of the First Earn Out Payment and all components thereof. Seller
shall be entitled to review the audit workpapers of Parents auditors relating
to the audit of such consolidated income statement.

(iii) _Payment; Disagreement_. Within seven (7) days after the receipt of
the First Earn Out Payment calculation from Parent, Seller shall (1) in the
event that Seller is in agreement with the First Earn Out Payment calculation,
confirm to Parent in writing Sellers agreement with the First Earn Out
Payment, which confirmation shall be accompanied by instructions as to the
form of the First Earn Out Payment elected by Seller and wire transfer or
delivery instructions, and within 3 (three) days after receipt of such
confirmation (the " _First Earn Out Payment Date_ "), Parent shall make the
First Earn Out Payment in accordance with the instructions received, or (2) in
the event Seller disagrees with the First Earn Out Payment calculation,
deliver to Parent a written notice  



 

\- 13 -  of such disagreement, specifying the nature of such disagreement, the
reasons therefor and Sellers recalculation of the First Earn Out Payment.
If Seller elects to receive any part of the First Earn Out Payment in Parent
Shares, then Seller shall receive such number of Parent Shares equal to such
part of the First Earn Out Payment divided by the average closing price per
Parent Share for the twenty (20) trading day period immediately preceding the
First Earn Out Payment Date, as reported by Bloomberg LP. Parent shall have
the right (but not the obligation) to set off such amount as is due to a Buyer
Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Article IX_ against the First Earn Out
Payment in accordance with the provisions of _Section 9.7(e)_. If Seller
delivers to Parent a written notice of disagreement with respect to Parents
calculation of the First Earn Out Payment, such disagreement shall be
resolved exclusively pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.6_ hereof.

(b) _Second Earn Out Payment_.

(i) _Calculation_. By the first Business Day after the earlier of the date
that Parent files, or is required to file, with the SEC its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the twelve months ending on December 31, 2009 (the " _Second
Earn Out Period_ "), Parent shall cause to be prepared (1) an audited
consolidated income statement of the Companies covering the Second Earn Out
Period, prepared consistent with past practice and in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied and used in the preparation of the Governing EBITDA
Income Statement, audited by Parents auditors (the fees and expenses of
which shall be paid by Parent), adjusted as set forth in _Schedule 1.1(a)(i)_
, and (2) a calculation of an Earn Out payment based on such consolidated
income statement (the " _Second Earn Out Payment_ "), as follows:



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

Second Earn Out Payment =

 |  | [(Second Adjusted EBITDA  Second Base EBITDA) ÷ (Second Hurdle
EBITDA  Second Base EBITDA)] × [($175,000,000  Closing Payment) ÷ 2];
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Second Earn Out Payment (i) shall be $0 if
Second Adjusted EBITDA is less than Second Base EBITDA, and (ii) shall not
exceed an amount equal to ($175,000,000  Closing Payment) ÷ 2, 
    | 
  

Where:

 |  | 
   | 
  

Second Adjusted EBITDA =

 |  | Adjusted EBITDA of the Companies for the Second Earn Out Period. 
   | 
  

Second Base EBITDA =

 |  | 0.93 × 1.15 × Governing EBITDA. 
   | 
  

Second Hurdle EBITDA =

 |  | 1.25 × 1.20 × Governing EBITDA. 
 

By way of illustration, assuming that Governing EBITDA is $18,000,000 and
Second Adjusted EBITDA is $27,000,000, then the Second Earn Out Payment will
be calculated as follows:



 

\- 14 - ---|---|--- 
  

Second Earn Out Payment =

 |  | [($27,000,000  (0.93 × 1.15 × $18,000,000)) ÷ ((1.25 × 1.20 ×
$18,000,000)  (0.93 × 1.15 × $18,000,000))] × [($175,000,000  $106,920,000)
÷ 2] = $34,040,000 
 

(ii) _Delivery to Seller_. By the first Business Day after the earlier of
the date that Parent files, or is required to file, with the SEC its Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ending December 31, 2009, Parent
will cause to be delivered to Seller the audited consolidated income statement
upon which the calculation of the Second Earn Out Payment is based and the
calculation of the Second Earn Out Payment and all components thereof. Seller
shall be entitled to review the audit workpapers of Parents auditors relating
to the audit of such consolidated income statement.

(iii) _Payment; Disagreement_. Within seven (7) days after the receipt of
the Second Earn Out Payment calculation from Parent, Seller shall (1) in the
event that Seller is in agreement with the Second Earn Out Payment
calculation, confirm to Parent in writing Sellers agreement with the Second
Earn Out Payment, which confirmation shall be accompanied by instructions as
to the form of the Second Earn Out Payment elected by Seller and wire transfer
or delivery instructions, and within 3 (three) days after receipt of such
confirmation (the " _Second Earn Out Payment Date_ "), Parent shall make the
Second Earn Out Payment in accordance with the instructions received, or (2)
in the event Seller disagrees with the Second Earn Out Payment calculation,
deliver to Parent a written notice of such disagreement, specifying the
nature of such disagreement, the reasons therefor and Sellers recalculation
of the Second Earn Out Payment. If Seller elects to receive any part of the
Second Earn Out Payment in Parent Shares, then Seller shall receive such
number of Parent Shares equal to such part of the Second Earn Out Payment
divided by the average closing price per Parent Share for the twenty (20)
trading day period immediately preceding the Second Earn Out Payment Date,
as reported by Bloomberg LP. Parent shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to set off such amount as is due to a Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Article IX_ against the Second Earn Out Payment in accordance
with the provisions of  _Section 9.7(e)_. If Seller delivers to Parent a
written notice of disagreement with respect to Parents calculation of the
Second Earn Out Payment, such disagreement shall be resolved exclusively
pursuant to the provisions of  _Section 2.6_ hereof.

(c) _Consultation_. During the Earn Out Period, Parent shall consult with

in connection with such calculation and the Parent Board shall act in
accordance with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law and otherwise act in
accordance with applicable Law.

which are no less favorable to the severance and similar benefits currently

purposes of eligibility and vesting to the extent past service was recognized
for such Company Employees under the comparable plans of Seller or the
applicable Company thereof immediately prior to the Closing, and to the same
extent past service is credited under such plans or arrangements for
similarly situated employees of Buyer or its Subsidiaries (except to the
extent that such recognition of service would result in a duplication of
benefits).

(c) In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to Company
Employees following the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries (i) to waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Company Employees and his or her covered
dependents under any such welfare benefits to the extent that such

employee stock incentive plan in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller and

the Trustee to have the funds in the Trust Account disbursed to Seller at
Closing, after taking into account any funds to be paid to (i) those Parent
Public Stockholders who both vote against the transactions contemplated by

accordance with Parents Organizational Documents and (ii) the underwriters
of the securities issued by Parent in its initial public offering as a
deferred underwriting discount.

Section 6.19  _Financing_. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
and do all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange debt financing in
an amount sufficient to supplement the amount available in the Trust Account
so that there is a sufficient amount of cash to pay the Cash Consideration to
Seller on the Closing Date and consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement after deducting amounts to be paid to (i) those Parent Public
Stockholders who both vote against the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and elect to have their shares converted into cash in accordance
with Parents Organizational Documents and (ii) the underwriters of the
securities issued by Parent in its initial public offering as deferred
underwriting discount.



 

\- 57 - Section 6.20 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at any time or from time to time after the Closing, at any Partys
request and without further consideration, the other Party shall execute and
deliver to such Party such other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance,
assignment and confirmation, provide such materials and information and take
such other actions and execute and deliver such other documents as such Party
may reasonably request in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, without limitation, the transfer of all of the

transactions contemplated hereby or result in the failure to satisfy any
condition to consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Conduct of Business_. During the Earn Out Periods, without the prior written
consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), Parent and Buyer shall (i) cause the Companies to remain
intact and indentifiably separate from and independent of any other Affiliate
of Parent or Buyer, (ii) cause the Companies to preserve their business
relationships, and (iii) refrain from conducting the business of the Companies
other than (1) in the ordinary course, (2) consistent with the manner in
which the business was conducted prior to the Closing, and (3) in the manner
contemplated by Sellers Business Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
conduct of such business shall comply with applicable Law and the Parent
Boards or Buyer Boards fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

Section 6.23 _Director and Officer Indemnification and Liability Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Companies to provide
indemnification to Stockholder and the current and former directors,
officers, employees and agents of the Companies (collectively, the " _Company
Indemnified Parties_ ") for all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement by reason of actions or omissions or alleged actions or omissions
in connection with their service to the Companies to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, and shall cause the Companies to perform their
obligations under such indemnification provisions in accordance with
their respective terms. In addition, from and after the Closing, Company
Indemnified Parties who become directors or officers of Parent will be
entitled to the indemnity rights and protections then afforded to other
directors and officers of Parent. 

(b) Parent shall, from and after the Closing and for as long as the current
officers and directors of the Companies and Stockholder are officers or
directors of the Companies or Parent (collectively, the " _D andO Parties_") and
for six years after the DandO Parties cease to be officers or directors of the
Companies or Parent, maintain in effect directors and officers liability
insurance covering such DandO Parties for acts or omissions or alleged acts or
 



 

\- 58 -  omissions in connection with their service to the Companies or Parent the
material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable
than the material terms of the Companies directors and officers liability
coverage in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that Parent may
substitute therefor policies of a reputable insurance company the
material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable
to such directors and officers and Stockholder than the insurance coverage
otherwise required under this _Section 6.23(b)_. Parent may satisfy in full
its obligation under this _Section 6.23(b)_ by acquiring a tail directors
and officers liability insurance policy (i) that covers each of the DandO
Parties for acts or omissions or alleged acts or omissions in connection with
their service to the Companies or Parent occurring prior to their ceasing to
be an officer or director the material terms of which, including coverage and
amount, are no less favorable to such directors and officers and Stockholder
than the insurance coverage otherwise required under this _Section 6.23(b)_,
and (ii) in respect of which the premium for a period until the sixth
anniversary of their ceasing to be an officer or director is prepaid at the
commencement of such period. 

(c) In the event that Parent (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
its properties and assets to any Person (including by dissolution), then, and
in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent assume and honor the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.23_.

reasonable efforts to cause employment agreements between the Company and each
of F. Clifton Cameron, Michael P. Dugan, Roy W. Horton, Clessie F. Titus and

ARTICLE VII

TAXES

Section 7.1 _Federal Tax Treatment_. The Parties acknowledge that for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the acquisition of the Deep South Shares will be
treated as a  



 

\- 59 -  transfer of the assets of the Deep South Qualified Sub-S Subsidiaries to
Buyer, followed by Buyers transfer of these assets to the capital of the
Deep South Qualified Sub-S Subsidiaries in exchange for the respective stock
of the Deep South Qualified Sub-S Subsidiaries.

Section 7.2  _Tax Returns_.

(a) Seller shall accurately prepare or cause to be accurately prepared, and

such Tax Returns. Buyer shall accurately prepare or cause to be accurately

relating to the Companies that are required to be filed after the Closing Date
and that include a period that precedes the Closing Date (including such Tax
Returns required to be filed that include a Straddle Period) and shall remit
and pay or cause to be remitted and paid any Taxes shown as due on such Tax
Returns (it being understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this  _Section 7.2(a)_ shall affect Sellers bearing of any Tax that is
described in _Section 9.2(c)_ hereof).

(b) Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall file or permit to be filed
any amended Tax Return with respect to the Companies for any period ending on
or before the Closing Date without obtaining the prior written consent of
Seller. If the filing of such an amended Tax Return with respect to such a
period is requested by Seller, Buyer shall file or cause to be filed such
amended Tax Return, _provided_ that the filing of such amended Tax Return will
not adversely affect Buyer, as reasonably determined by Buyer, and Seller
shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer and the
applicable Company in respect of such filing.

Section 7.3 _Cooperation_. After the Closing, the Parties shall cooperate, and
shall cause their Affiliates to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns relating to the Companies to the extent reasonably requested,
including by providing each other with reasonable access to information,
records, documents, properties and personnel relating to the Companies. The
Parties shall cooperate, and shall cause their Affiliates to cooperate, in
the same manner in defending or resolving any audit, examination or
litigation relating to Taxes.

Section 7.4 _Property Taxes_. All real or personal property and ad valorem
Taxes of the Companies (" _Property Taxes_ ") which shall have accrued and
become payable prior to the Closing Date shall be paid by Seller. All other
Property Taxes of the Companies shall be paid by Buyer. All Property Taxes
shall be prorated to the Closing Date. In connection with such proration, in
the event the actual figures with respect to Taxes are not available at the
Closing Date, initial proration of such Property Taxes shall be based on one
hundred five percent (105%) of the actual Taxes for the preceding year for
which actual figures with respect to such Taxes are available, with such
proration being adjusted as applicable information becomes available. 

Section 7.5 _Tax Refunds_. If, at any time on or after the Closing Date, (i)
Parent, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates receives any refund,
rebate, return, credit or other similar payment with respect to Taxes from any
Tax Authority relating to the Companies for a period ending on or before the
Closing Date, or (ii) Parent, Buyer or any of their respective  



 

\- 60 -  Affiliates receives any refund, rebate, return, credit or other similar
payment relating to Taxes for which Buyer was indemnified under this
Agreement, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing of such receipt and
shall remit the amount of such payment (including any interest thereon
received from the Tax Authority) to Seller, net of any direct costs actually
realized from the receipt of such refund, rebate, return, credit, or similar
amount (including Taxes payable with respect to such refund, rebate, return,
credit or similar amount).

Section 7.6 _Conveyance Taxes_. Buyer shall pay one-half (1/2) of the cost of
all Conveyance Taxes relating to the transfer of the automobiles listed on
_Schedule 7.6_ up to $25,000. Seller shall pay the cost of all other
Conveyance Taxes. The Tax Returns for Conveyance Taxes required by reason of
said transfer shall be timely prepared by the party legally obligated to make
such filing. The Parties agree to cooperate with each other in connection with
the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns, in obtaining all available
exemptions from such Conveyance Taxes and in timely providing each other with
resale certificates and any other documents necessary to satisfy any such
exemptions.

Section 7.7 _Tax Treatment of Earn Out_. Unless otherwise determined by the
IRS or required by Law, the Parties shall treat all amounts payable pursuant
to _Section 2.3_ hereof as additional purchase price payable to Seller.

Section 7.8 _Determination and Allocation of Consideration_. The Parties
agree to determine the amount of and allocate the consideration transferred by
Buyer to Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement (the "
_Consideration_ ") in accordance with the fair market value of the assets and
liabilities transferred. To the extent amounts of the Earn Out are considered
additional consideration, rather than interest, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Parties shall treat such amounts as part of the Consideration,
in a manner consistent with the terms of this _Section 7.8_. Seller shall
provide Buyer with one or more schedules allocating the Consideration prior to
or promptly following the Closing for Buyers review and consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If Buyer does not
inform Seller in writing within twenty (20) days that it is withholding
consent and the basis for objection, then the submitted allocation of
Consideration shall be deemed accepted and agreed, and final and conclusive
for all purposes of this Agreement, _provided_ that such allocation shall be
subject to adjustment to the extent required by Law. In the event that Buyer
informs Seller in writing within twenty (20) days that it is withholding
consent, then an accounting firm mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller shall
be promptly retained to determine the allocation of the Consideration for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. The determination of such accounting firm shall
be binding on the Parties. The costs of retaining such accounting firm shall
be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller.
Seller and Buyer agree to prepare and file an IRS Form 8594 in a timely
fashion in accordance with the rules under Section 1060 of the Code. To the
extent that the Consideration is adjusted after the Closing Date, the Parties
agree to revise and amend the schedule and IRS Form 8594 in the same manner
and according to the same procedure. The determination and allocation of the
Consideration derived pursuant to this _Section 7.8_ shall be binding on
Seller and Buyer for all income Tax reporting purposes. 



 

\- 61 - Section 7.9 _Tax Covenants_.

(a) Without the consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, and with respect only to income, franchise or similar
taxes in any state or local jurisdiction within the United States in which
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are treated as other than a
sale of assets, during the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date,
none of Seller, its Affiliates and the Companies shall make, change or
rescind any material Tax election, change any material Tax accounting period,
change any method of Tax accounting or file for any change in accounting
method, settle any material Tax claim or assessment or surrender any right to
claim for a material Tax refund, in each case if such action may have a
material adverse effect on Buyer or any Company in a taxable period that ends
after the Closing Date.

(b) Without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, and with respect only to income, franchise or
similar taxes in any state or local jurisdiction within the United States in
which the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are treated as other
than a sale of assets, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall make,
change or rescind any material Tax election, change any material Tax
accounting period, change any method of Tax accounting or file for any change
in accounting method, settle any material Tax claim or assessment or surrender
any right to claim for a material Tax refund, in each case if such action may
have a material adverse effect on Seller or any of its Affiliates in any
taxable period (or portion of any taxable period) that ends before the Closing
Date.

Section 7.10 _Miscellaneous_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
covenants and agreements contained in this _Article VII_ , _Section 9.2(c)_,
_Section 9.3(c)_ and _Section 9.2(f)_ shall survive the Closing and shall
remain in full force until the expiration of the applicable statutes of
limitations for the Taxes in question (taking into account any extensions or
waivers thereof).

(b) For Tax purposes, the Parties agree to treat all payments made under this
_Article VII_ , _Section 9.2(c)_, _Section 9.3(c)_ and _Section 9.2(f)_,
under any indemnity provisions contained in this Agreement, and for any
breaches of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements, as
adjustments to the purchase price, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law.

against any Seller Indemnified Party with respect to the Companies.

Section 9.4 _Limits on Indemnification_.

(a) No claim may be asserted nor may any action be commenced against any Party
for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein, unless written notice of such claim or action is received
by such Party describing in reasonable detail  



 

\- 66 -  the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim
or action on or prior to the date on which the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on which such claim or action is based ceases
to survive as set forth in _Section 9.1_ hereof.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (i)
an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ hereof, unless and until
the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the
Indemnifying Party equals or exceeds $1,000,000, after which the Indemnifying
Party shall be liable only for those Losses in excess of $500,000, (ii) the
maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from Seller and
Stockholder, taken together, arising out of or resulting from the causes set
forth in _Section 9.2_ hereof shall be an amount equal to 10% of the Purchase
Price, (iii) the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered from Buyer arising out of or resulting from the causes set forth in
_Section 9.3_ hereof shall be an amount equal to 10% of the Purchase Price
and (iv) no Party shall have any liability under any provision of this
Agreement for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect
damages, including loss of future revenue or income, or loss of business
reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.2(c)_, _Section 9.2(e)_, _Section 9.2(f)_ or
_Section 9.3(c)_ hereof shall not be subject to any of the limits set forth
in _Section 9.4(b)(i)_, _(ii)_ or _(iii)_.

(c) For the purpose of calculating the amount of any Loss for which an
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the
amount of each Loss shall be deemed to be an amount net of (i) any insurance
proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment payable by
any insurer or other third party with respect thereto and (ii) any Tax benefit
actually realized by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates as a result of
the incurrence or payment of such Loss. Each Indemnified Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to commence legal or other proceedings to
collect indemnity, contribution or other payments from any such insurer or
other third party. The reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) actually incurred by any
Indemnified Party in pursuing any insurance proceeds or indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment from any insurer or other third party
under clause (i) above shall constitute additional Losses with respect to the
matter for which indemnification may be sought hereunder, except to the extent
such costs and expenses are paid or reimbursed by such insurer or other third
party.

(d) Each Indemnified Party shall have a duty to use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Loss for which an Indemnifying Party is obligated
to indemnify an Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article IX_ , including
by maintaining (or obtaining new insurance policies that provide a level of
coverage that equals or exceeds that provided under) the insurance policies or
programs covering the Companies as of the date of this Agreement.

Section 9.5 _Subrogation_. Each Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to
any right of action (including any defense or claim) which any Indemnified
Party may have against any other Person with respect to any matter giving rise
to a claim for indemnification hereunder.



 

\- 67 - Section 9.6 _Parent s Off-Set._ Subject to _Section 9.8_ hereof, the
Parties acknowledge that the off-set rights granted to Parent pursuant to
_Section 2.3(a)(iii)_ and _Section 2.3(b)(iii)_ may only be in partial
compensation for amounts due to one or more Buyer Indemnified Parties, and
shall not constitute the sole or exclusive remedy of Parent or Buyer with
respect to any loss or losses suffered by any of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties.

Section 9.7 _Indemnification Procedure_.

(a) Any Indemnified Party claiming indemnification under this Agreement
with respect to any claim asserted against the Indemnified Party by a third
party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that is subject to
indemnification under _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ hereof shall promptly
(i) notify the Indemnifying Party of the Third Party Claim and (ii) transmit
to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (a " _Third Party Claim Notice_ ")
in accordance with _Section 11.1_ hereof describing in reasonable detail the
nature of the Third Party Claim and the basis of the Indemnified Partys
request for indemnification under this Agreement, together with a copy of all
papers served with respect to such claim, if any. Subject to  _Section 9.1_
hereof, any failure to timely provide such Third Party Claim Notice shall not
affect the right of the Indemnified Partys indemnification hereunder, except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay or omission.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to investigate the basis of,
and to defend the Indemnified Party against, such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
elects to conduct such investigation and assume the defense of the Third Party
Claim (such election to be without prejudice to the right of the Indemnifying
Party to dispute whether such claim is an indemnifiable Loss under this
_Article IX_ ), then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend
such Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (who
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), by all
appropriate proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement at the discretion
of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _Section 9.7(b)_. In such
circumstances, the Indemnifying Party shall defend any such Third Party Claim
in good faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings, including
any compromise or settlement thereof; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party
shall not enter into any settlement agreement without the written consent of
the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that such consent shall not
be required if (i) the settlement agreement contains from the third party
asserting the claim a general release to all Indemnified Parties affected by
the claim and (ii) the settlement agreement does not contain any sanction or
restriction upon the conduct of any business by the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates. If the Indemnified Party shall withhold its consent to the
Indemnifying Party proposed settlement of such Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnifying Party may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay the Indemnified
Party the full amount of the proposed settlement, in which case, the
Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of any further liability under this
_Article IX_ to the same extent as if such proposed settlement had been
entered into on the terms proposed by the Indemnifying Party. Each of the
Parties shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate,
in the defense or prosecution of any legal or other proceeding that is the
subject of indemnification hereunder and shall promptly execute such
instruments and furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.  



 

\- 68 -  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Indemnified Party
shall take such additional actions as reasonably requested by the Indemnifying
Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which the
Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including the making of any related
counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross
complaint against any Person, and, to the extent the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for its
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses actually incurred in taking such
requested actions. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control,
any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 9.7(b)_, and the
Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not
have the right to assume (but shall have the right to participate in) the
defense of such Third Party Claim, notwithstanding having begun such
undertaking, or giving written acknowledgment of such undertaking, if (i) the
claim seeks only an injunction or other equitable relief; (ii) the Indemnified
Party shall have been advised by counsel that there are one or more legal or
equitable defenses available to them which are different from or in addition
to those available to the Indemnifying Party, and, in the reasonable opinion
of counsel for the Indemnified Party, counsel for the Indemnifying Party
could not properly represent the interests of the Indemnified Party because
such interests could be in conflict with those of the Indemnifying Party;
(iii) such action or proceeding involves, or could have a material effect on,
any material matter beyond the scope of the indemnification obligation of the
Indemnifying Party; (iv) such Third Party Claim relates to Taxes and the
resolution of such Third Party Claim may have an adverse effect on the
Tax liability of Buyer or the Companies for a taxable period that begins
after the Closing Date; or (v) the Indemnifying Party shall not have assumed
the defense of such Third Party Claim in a timely fashion; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Indemnified Party enter into any
settlement agreement without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party shall (A) fail to notify the Indemnified Party
that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section 9.7(b)_ hereof within thirty (30) days after receipt of any Third
Party Claim Notice or (B) after commencing or undertaking any such defense or
settlement, fail to prosecute such defense or settlement, then the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to defend, and be reimbursed for its
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses actually incurred (but only if
the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in
regard to the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party
(who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by
the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall
defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such
defense and proceedings; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party may not enter
into any compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim if indemnification
is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Partys written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this  _Section
9.7(c)_, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with
respect to such participation.

(d) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article IX_ , a claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim may be
asserted by prompt  



 

\- 69 -  written notice (a " _Non-Third Party Claim Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying
Party, which notice shall set forth the basis of such claim in reasonable
detail and be accompanied by evidence supporting the assertion of such claim.

(e) _Resolution of Claims._ Within twenty (20) days following the receipt by
the Indemnifying Party of a Third Party Claim Notice or a Non-Third Party
Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will seek in
good faith to determine the final amount to be paid by the Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement. If at the end of such twenty (20) days such final amount is
not agreed upon, the Indemnifying Party shall select an
independent registered public accounting firm (the " _Indemnity Referee_ ")
from among KPMG LLP, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Ernst and Young and Deloitte and
Touche LLP (provided that any such selected firm shall not otherwise
be engaged by either Party), to determine such final amount or to determine
that such final amount is not determinable. If the Indemnity Referee is
engaged with respect to any claim made by the Indemnified Party prior to
September 1, 2008, the Indemnity Referee shall be directed to determine the
final amount of such claim or to determine that such final amount is not
determinable no later than December 30, 2008. If the Indemnity Referee is
engaged with respect to any claim made by the Indemnified Party after
September 1, 2008 and prior to September 1, 2009, the Indemnity Referee shall
be directed to determine the final amount of such claim or to determine that
such final amount is not determinable no later than December 30, 2009. If the
Indemnity Referee determines such final amount, the determination by the
Indemnity Referee shall be delivered in writing to, and shall be final and
binding upon, each of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnity Referee determines that the final amount is not determinable
(due to the fact that it relates to a Third Party Claim or otherwise), then
the procedures of this _Section 9.7(e)_ shall be suspended until
the resolution of the Third Party Claim or the final amount is otherwise
determinable, at which time the procedures of this _Section 9.7(e)_ shall be
complied with. Payment of a final amount shall be made by the Indemnifying
Party within five (5) Business Days after receipt by such Indemnifying Party
of the written determination of the Indemnity Referee of such final amount.
Each of Stockholder, Seller, Buyer and Parent hereby agrees that the
provisions of this  _Section 9.7(e)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with respect to resolving
any issue or claim relating to indemnification under this Agreement. In the
event that a final amount of any indemnification payment to be made by Seller
or Stockholder as the Indemnifying Party to a Buyer Indemnified Party has been
determined pursuant to this _Section 9.7(e)_ but has not been paid at the
time that an Earn Out Payment (or a payment pursuant to _Section 2.3(d))_ is
due, then Parent may deduct the final amount from such Earn Out Payment. The
fees and expenses of the Indemnity Referee shall be paid one half by Seller
and one half by Parent.

Section 9.8 _Remedies_. Except in the event of fraud or willful or intentional
breach or misconduct, each of Buyer, Parent, Seller and Stockholder
acknowledges and agrees that (i) following the Closing, the indemnification
provisions of this _Article IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of
Buyer and Seller for any breach of the representations and warranties in this
Agreement and for any failure by the other Party to perform and comply with
any covenants and agreements in this Agreement and (ii) anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of the
Parties, after the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Deep South
Interests contemplated by this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby.



 

\- 70 - Section 9.9 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Parties agree to treat all
payments made pursuant to this _Article IX_ as adjustments to the Purchase
Price for Tax purposes (except to the extent such treatment would not be
permitted by Law).

Registration Rights Agreement, (iii) there shall be any Law that makes
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder or under the Related
Documents illegal or otherwise prohibited, or (iv) the Closing has not

or before March 31, 2008 (the " _Outside Date_ ") or such later date as the
Parties may agree upon in writing.

Parent shall pay Seller a fee equal to $4,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "),
and such amount shall constitute liquidated damages in respect of such
termination regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such termination.
Any fee due under this _Section 10.2_ shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account or accounts specified by Seller in
writing as soon as any of the funds in the Trust Account are distributed

Parents Public Stockholders.

(b) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 10.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, neither Party would have entered
into this Agreement. Each of the Parties acknowledges that in the event Seller
is entitled to receive the Termination Fee, the right of Seller to receive
such amount shall constitute Sellers sole and exclusive remedy for, and such
amount shall constitute liquidated damages in respect of, the breach or
termination of this Agreement regardless of the circumstances giving rise to
such breach or termination and Seller shall have no further rights, directly
or indirectly, against Buyer or any of its Affiliates, stockholders,
directors, officers and agents, whether at Law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise.

Section 10.3 _Termination_. Seller and Stockholder acknowledge the provisions
of _Section 6.2 _hereof. Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section
10.3_, in the event of termination and abandonment of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 10.1_ hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have
no effect, without any liability on the part of any Party; _provided_ that if
this Agreement is validly terminated by a Party as a result of an intentional,
material breach of this Agreement by the non-terminating Party, then the
terminating Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available
under Law or equity. Parent acknowledges that any damages incurred by Seller
or Stockholder as a result of breach by Parent or Buyer of this Agreement
shall be payable by Parent whenever any of the funds in the Trust Account
are distributed other than to Parents Public Stockholders. Seller and
Stockholder acknowledge that in the event all the funds in the Trust Account
are distributed to Parents Public Stockholders, no amount shall be payable in
respect of any damages incurred by Seller or Stockholder as a result of

Section 11.2 _Assignment_. No Party shall assign this Agreement or any part
hereof without the prior written consent of the other Party. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

Section 11.3 _Rights of Third Parties_. Except with respect to the rights set
forth in Section 6.16 and Section 6.23 hereof, nothing expressed or implied in
this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any
Person, other than the Parties, their successors and permitted assigns, any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect to this
Agreement or any provision contained herein.

Section 11.4 _Expenses_. Each Party shall bear its own expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein
whether or not such transactions shall be consummated, including all fees and
disbursements of its legal counsel, financial advisers and accountants, except

Buyer shall bear and pay the costs and expenses incurred in connection with
any filings made under the HSR Act.

Section 11.5  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered in
two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any
facsimile copies hereof or signature hereon shall, for all purposes, be
deemed originals.

Section 11.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Disclosure
Schedules and exhibits to this Agreement) and the Related Documents constitute
the entire agreement among the Parties and supersede any other agreements and
undertakings, whether written or oral, that may have been made or
entered into by or among any of the Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and
effect. No representations, warranties, covenants, understandings or
agreements, oral or otherwise, relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Related Documents exist between Buyer, on the one hand,
and Seller or its Affiliates, on the other hand, except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement, the Related Documents and the Confidentiality
Agreement.

Section 11.7 _Disclosure Schedules_. Unless the context otherwise requires,
all capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules shall have the
respective meanings assigned in this Agreement. No reference to or disclosure
of any item or other matter in the Disclosure  



 

\- 74 -  Schedules shall be construed as an admission or indication that such item or
other matter is material or that such item or other matter is required to
be referred to or disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules. No disclosure in the
Disclosure Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of any
agreement or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any
such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. The inclusion of
any information in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment by Seller, in and of itself, that such information
is material to or outside the ordinary course of the business of the
Companies or required to be disclosed on the Disclosure Schedules. Each
disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to qualify all
representations and warranties of Seller notwithstanding the lack of a
specific cross-reference.

determined by the Parties.

Section 11.9 _Waiver_. Either Party may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
Party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other Party
pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the
other Party or conditions to such Partys obligations contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the Party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or
condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a
subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term
or condition of this Agreement. The failure of either Party to assert any of
its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

Section 11.10 _Publicity_. Except as otherwise required by Law or the rules
and regulations of any national securities exchange, no Party shall issue any
press release or otherwise make any public statement with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Documents or
otherwise communicate with any news media without prior consultation with and
consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Each of the Parties shall cooperate, and shall cause
their respective Representatives to cooperate, as to the timing and contents
of any such press release, public statement or communication.

Section 11.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the
rights or obligations under this Agreement of Seller on the one hand and Buyer
on the other hand will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a)
such provision will be fully severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed
and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision had never
comprised a part hereof and (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement
will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the
illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this
Agreement. Upon such determination that any provision of this Agreement is
illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties
as closely as possible in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.



 

\- 75 - Section 11.12 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the Laws of the
State of New York (without regard to the conflict of law principles
thereof). Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement
of any judgment in respect hereof shall be brought and determined in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or if such
legal action or proceeding may not be brought in such court for jurisdictional
purposes, in the Supreme Court of New York. Each of the Parties hereby (a)
irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby,
(b) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court or that

ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
