ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE CONTRIBUTOR 

  

 The Contributor hereby represents and warrants to the Acquirer Parties as follows: 

   

 3.1. _ _ _Organization; Qualification_. The Contributor is a legal entity duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified, registered or licensed to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by such Person or the nature of the business conducted by such Person makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified, registered or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which the Contributor is a party or to materially impair the Contributor\'s ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party. 

  

 3.2. _ _ _Authority; Enforceability_. 

  

 (a) The Contributor has the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. The execution and delivery by the Contributor of the Transaction Documents to which the Contributor is a party, and the consummation by the Contributor of the transactions contemplated thereby, have been duly and validly authorized by the Contributor, and no other limited liability company proceedings on the part of the Contributor are necessary to authorize the Transaction Documents to which it is a party or to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which it is a party. 

  

 (b) The Transaction Documents to which the Contributor is a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Contributor, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties thereto (other than the Contributor), each Transaction Document to which the Contributor is a party constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Contributor, enforceable against the 

        

Contributor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors\' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to legal
principles of general applicability governing the availability of equitable
remedies, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and
fair dealing (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law) (collectively, " _Creditors\' Rights_ ").

  

 3.3. _ _ _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents to which the Contributor is a party by the Contributor and the consummation by the Contributor of the transactions contemplated thereby does not and will not: (a) result in any breach of any provision of the Organizational Documents of the Contributor; (b) except with respect to the Contributor Credit Agreement, which shall be fully repaid and terminated at or prior to the Closing, constitute a default (or an event that with notice or passage of time or both would give rise to a default) under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration (with or without the giving of notice, or the passage of time or both) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which the Contributor is a party or by which any property or asset of the Contributor is bound or affected; or (c) violate any Law to which the Contributor is subject or by which any of the Contributor\'s properties or assets is bound, except, in the cases of clauses (b) and (c), for such defaults or rights of termination, cancellation, amendment, or acceleration or violations as would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which the Contributor is a party or to materially impair the Contributor\'s ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party. 

  

 3.4. _ _ _Governmental Approvals_. No declaration, filing or registration with, or notice to, or authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority is necessary for the consummation by the Contributor of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, other than such declarations, filings, registrations, notices, authorizations, consents or approvals that have been obtained or made or that would in the ordinary course be made or obtained after the Closing, or which, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which the Contributor is a party or to materially impair the Contributor\'s ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party. 

  

 3.5. _ _ _Representations as to Contributed Interest_. 

  

 (a) The Contributed Interest constitutes all of the equity interests of the Company owned beneficially or of record by the Contributor or its Affiliates. 

   

 (b) The Contributor is the sole record and beneficial owner of, and has good and valid title to, the Contributed Interest, free and clear of all Liens other than (i) the Lien evidenced by the Contributor Credit Agreement, which Lien shall be extinguished upon the full repayment and termination of the Contributor Credit Agreement at or prior to the Closing, (ii) any transfer restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws and (iii) any transfer restrictions contained in the Organizational Documents of the Company. 

  

 (c) At the Closing, the Contributor will assign, convey, transfer and deliver to MWE, through the Acquirer, good and valid title to the Contributed Interest, free and clear of all Liens other than (i) any transfer restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws, (ii) any transfer restrictions contained in the Organizational Documents of the Company and (iii) any Liens on the Contributed Interest as a result of actions by the Acquirer Parties or their Affiliates. 

  

 (d) Neither the Contributor nor any of its Affiliates is a party to any agreements, arrangements or commitments obligating the Contributor to grant, deliver or sell, or cause to be granted, delivered or sold, the Contributed Interest, by sale, lease, license or otherwise, other than this Agreement. 

        

 (e) Except as set forth in the Company LLC Agreement, there are no voting trusts, proxies or other agreements or understandings to which the Contributor is bound with respect to the voting of the Contributed Interest. 

  

 3.6. _ _ _Matters Relating to Transactions_. 

   

 (a) The Contributor has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Unit Consideration and is capable of bearing the economic risk of such investment. The Contributor is an "accredited investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D (without regard to Rule 501(a)(4)) promulgated under the Securities Act. The Contributor is acquiring the Unit Consideration for investment for its own account and not with a view toward or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, or with any present intention of distributing or selling the Unit Consideration. The Contributor is not a party to any Contract with any Person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such Person or to any third Person, with respect to the Unit Consideration. The Contributor acknowledges and understands that (i) the acquisition of the Unit Consideration has not been registered under the Securities Act in reliance on an exemption therefrom and (ii) that the Unit Consideration will be characterized as "restricted securities" under state and federal securities laws. The Contributor agrees that the Unit Consideration may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of except (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to an available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in compliance with other applicable state and federal securities laws and (ii) in compliance with all transfer restrictions in the MWE Partnership Agreement, including the transfer restrictions applicable to the Contributor set forth in Sections 4.6(e) and 4.6(f) of the MWE Partnership Agreement. 

  

 (b) The Contributor has had an opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from the Acquirer Parties regarding the terms and conditions of the contribution of the Contributed Interest and the offering of the Unit Consideration pursuant to this Agreement and the business, properties, prospects, and financial condition of the Company and MWE. The foregoing, however, does not modify the representations and warranties of the Acquirer Parties in _Article IV_ and such representations and warranties constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the Acquirer Parties to the Contributor in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (c) The Contributor has all right, power and authority necessary to enter into the MWE Partnership Agreement at the Closing upon its receipt of the Unit Consideration. 

  

 3.7. _ _ _Brokers\' Fee_. Except for the fee payable to Citigroup Global Markets Group, Inc., which shall be paid by the Contributor, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Contributor. 

       

                                    

   

    
ARTICLE IV 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE ACQUIRER PARTIES 

  

 The Acquirer Parties hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Contributor as follows: 

   

 4.1. _ _ _Organization; Qualification_. 

  

 (a) Each Acquirer Party is a legal entity duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware and has all requisite organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified, registered or licensed to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified, registered or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have an MWE Material Adverse Effect or to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which it is a party or to materially impair its ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party. 

  

 (b) MWE is properly treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. MWE would not be treated as an investment company (within the meaning of Code Section 351) if it were incorporated. 

  

 (c) Acquirer is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(b). Acquirer has not elected to be classified as an association, taxable as a corporation, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701.3(a), and will not make any such election that would be contrary to the treatment agreed upon by the Parties in Section 5.7(b). 

  

 4.2. _ _ _Authority; Enforceability_. 

  

 (a) Each Acquirer Party has the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. The execution and delivery by each Acquirer Party of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated thereby, have been duly and validly authorized by such Acquirer Party, and no other limited liability company or limited partnership proceedings, as applicable, on the part of such Acquirer Party are necessary to authorize the Transaction Documents to which it is a party or to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which it is a party. 

  

 (b) The Transaction Documents to which each Acquirer Party is a party have been duly executed and delivered by such Acquirer Party, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties thereto, each Transaction Document to which such Acquirer Party is a party constitutes the valid and binding agreement of such Acquirer Party, enforceable against such Acquirer Party in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by Creditors\' Rights. 

  

 4.3. _ _ _Non-Contravention_. 

  

 (a) The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents to which each Acquirer Party is a party by such Acquirer Party and the consummation by each Acquirer Party of the transactions contemplated thereby does not and will not: (a) result in any breach of any provision of the Organizational Documents of each Acquirer Party; (b) constitute a default (or an event that with notice or passage of time or both would give rise to a default) under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration (with or without the giving of notice, or the passage of time or both) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which such Acquirer Party is a party or by which any property or asset of such Acquirer Party is bound or 

        

affected; or (c) violate any Law to which either Acquirer Party is subject or
by which any of such Acquirer Party\'s properties or assets is bound, except,
in the cases of clauses (b) and (c), for such defaults or rights of
termination, cancellation, amendment, or acceleration or violations as would
not reasonably be expected to have an MWE Material Adverse Effect or to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Documents to which each Acquirer Party is a party or to
materially impair such Acquirer Party\'s ability to perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

   

 (b) Except for such consents as have been obtained at or prior to the Closing, no consents are required under the MWE Credit Agreements or MWE Indentures to permit the consummation of the Transactions. 

  

 4.4. _ _ _Governmental Approvals_. No declaration, filing or registration with, or notice to, or authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority is necessary for the consummation by either Acquirer Party of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, other than such declarations, filings, registrations, notices, authorizations, consents or approvals which, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to have an MWE Material Adverse Effect or to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which either Acquirer Party is a party or to materially impair either Acquirer Party\'s ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party. 

  

 4.5. _ _ _Capitalization_. 

  

 (a) As of the date of this Agreement, 94,939,558 MWE Common Units are issued and outstanding and 22,640,000 MWE Class A Units are issued and outstanding. Such Common Units and Class A Units represent the only limited partnership interests of MWE outstanding as of the date of this Agreement.

The Parties shall consult with each other prior to issuing any public announcement, statement or other disclosure with respect to the Transactions and none of the Contributor and their respective Affiliates on one hand nor the Acquirer Parties and their respective Affiliates on the other shall issue any such public announcement, statement or other disclosure without having first notified the Contributor on one hand or the Acquirer Parties on the other; _provided, however_ , that MWE and its Affiliates may make any public disclosure without first so consulting with or notifying the Contributor if MWE or any such Affiliate reasonably believes that it is required to do so by Law or by any stock exchange listing requirement or trading agreement concerning the publicly traded securities of MWE. 

       

                                     

    

 5.5. _ _ _Confidentiality_. The Contributor acknowledges and agrees that the obligations set forth in Section 5.4 of the Company LLC Agreement shall continue in full effect following the Closing, but that the Contributor shall not have the right to enforce the provisions thereof except with respect to disclosure of any Confidential Information of the Contributor or its Affiliates. 

   

 5.6. _ _ _Agreements Relating to MWE Partnership Agreement_. The Contributor acknowledges and agrees that at the Closing the Contributor shall: (a) become a Limited Partner (as such term is defined in the MWE Partnership Agreement) and comply with and be bound by the MWE Partnership Agreement, including the restrictions on transfer applicable to the Contributor set forth in Sections 4.6(e) and 4.6(f) thereof and the voting restrictions applicable to the Contributor set forth in Section 5.7(d) thereof and in the definition of the defined term "Outstanding" in the MWE Partnership Agreement, and shall be deemed to have executed the MWE Partnership Agreement; (b) be deemed to have granted the powers of attorney provided for in the Partnership Agreement; and (c) be deemed to have made the waivers and given the consents and approvals contained in the MWE Partnership Agreement. 

  

 5.7. _ Tax Matters._ 

  

 (a) _ Tax Responsibilities._ Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party shall bear all taxes imposed on it as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party shall timely file, to the extent required by or permissible under applicable Law, all tax returns and other documentation with respect to any such taxes. 

  

 (b) _ Tax Treatment._ The Parties intend to treat the transactions contemplated by _Article II_ as an "assets-over" partnership merger within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), whereby (i) first, the Contributor is treated as selling a portion of the Contributed Interest to MWE in exchange for the Cash Sale Consideration in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(4) (and the Contributor hereby agrees to treat the transfer of such portion of the Contributed Interest to MWE as a sale for all tax purposes), (ii) second, the Company is treated as contributing to MWE pursuant to Section 721 of the Code an undivided interest in each of the Company\'s assets in exchange for the Unit Consideration and the Cash Distribution Consideration, with the Cash Distribution Consideration being treated as a reimbursement of a portion of the Company\'s preformation capital expenditures pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-4(d), and (iii) third, the Company is treated as liquidating, distributing (A) the Cash Contribution Consideration and the Unit Consideration to the Contributor and (B) the remainder of the Company\'s underlying assets to MWE.

 (c) _ Agreement to Cooperate._ Except as provided herein, each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate fully with the other Parties, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other Party, in connection with the filing of tax returns and any proceeding with respect to taxes. If upon audit of the Company\'s federal income tax return for the period ending December 31, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service proposes to treat the receipt of all or a portion of the Cash Distribution Consideration as proceeds from the sale of assets by the Company to MWE, any income or gain resulting from the proposed adjustment will be allocated for all tax purposes to the Contributor. Acquirer, as the tax matters partner of the Company, will contest any proposed adjustment with respect to the treatment of the receipt of the Cash Distribution Consideration at the direction of the Contributor; provided that the Contributor shall be liable for and shall pay all of the direct out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Acquirer Parties in contesting such claims. The parties covenant to make such adjustments to the Company\'s post contribution tax returns (and any related information returns of its members) as are necessary to reflect any adjustments to the treatment of the transactions as contemplated herein. 

        

 (d) _ Tax and Accounting Effective Time._ The Parties agree that, for administrative convenience, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be deemed to be effective for all tax and accounting purposes as of 11:59 p.m. on December 31, 2011.

 (e) _ MWE Allocations._ The Parties acknowledge that MWE will apply the principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d) to address the difference between the fair market value and the adjusted tax basis of the portion of the Company assets deemed contributed to MWE. 

  

 (f) _ Allocation of Consideration._ Acquirer Parties shall, within 90 days following the Closing, prepare and deliver to Contributor for its review and approval a purchase price allocation among the Company\'s assets consistent with the principles of Sections 704(b) and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Allocation_ ") and the Contributor shall have 10 days following delivery of the Allocation to object to the Allocation. If the Contributor objects to the Allocation and the Parties cannot come to a mutually agreeable resolution regarding such objection, the Parties shall select a mutually agreeable third-party public accounting firm to resolve such objection and any other disputes relating to the Allocation. Upon agreement of the Parties or determination of the third-party public accounting firm with respect to the Allocation, the Parties agree (A) to file all tax returns consistently with the Allocation, and (B) that neither Party or any of their respective Affiliates or direct or indirect owners shall take a position on any tax return, or before any Governmental Authority in connection with the examination of a tax return or in any judicial proceeding, that is in any manner inconsistent with the terms of the Allocation, except as required by a determination, as defined in Section 1313 of the Code. If, any taxing authority makes or proposes an allocation different from the Allocation, the Parties shall cooperate with each other in good faith to contest such taxing authority\'s allocation (or proposed allocation), _provided_ , _however_ , that, after consultation with the Party (or Parties) adversely affected by such allocation (or proposed allocation), the other Party (or Parties) hereto may file such protective claims or tax returns as may be reasonably required to protect its (or their) interests. 

  

 (g) _ Tax Returns._ Acquirer shall be responsible for filing the Company\'s tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2011, including an election for the Company under Section 754 of the Code, if applicable. Acquirer shall provide a copy of each such tax return at least sixty (60) days before the due date for such tax return along with a computation of the allocations of tax, if any, to Contributor in accordance with the Company LLC Agreement as in effect immediately before the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to the filing of such tax returns, Acquirer shall make any revisions or adjustments reasonably requested by Contributor. The Parties shall each provide the other with all information reasonably necessary to prepare such tax returns. 

  

 (h) _ Changes and Amendments to Tax Matters._ With respect to the Company\'s tax year ended December 31, 2011 or any prior tax year, without Contributor\'s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), Acquirer Partners and their Affiliates will not, on behalf of or with respect to the Company or its assets, and will not cause the Company to, (i) make any material tax elections (except elections consistent with past practices), (ii) amend any tax returns or settle or compromise any federal, state, local or foreign tax liability, or (iii) enter into any agreement or preliminary settlement concerning taxes or file any waiver extending the statutory period for assessment or reassessment of taxes or any other waiver of restrictions on assessment or collection of any taxes. 

        

 5.8. _ Agreements and Waivers Relating to Contributed Interest._ 

   

 (a) The Contributor acknowledges and agrees, for and on behalf of itself and its respective Affiliates, that: 

  

  

 (i) after the Closing, the Contributed Interest may increase in value and the Contributor and its Affiliates will not receive or realize any benefit from such increase in value or any increase in the value of the Company or its successors generally, other than indirectly through an increase in the value of the MWE Class B Units, including that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Contributor shall not be entitled to share in any distributions made by the Company after the Closing, including any distribution of Available Cash associated with the fourth quarter of 2011; 

  

 (ii) there are inherent uncertainties in valuing illiquid securities like the Contributed Interest such that a third-party valuation of the Contributed Interest could have resulted in a materially higher or lower valuation than that attributable to the Contribution Consideration received by the Contributor under this Agreement; 

  

 (iii) the Company may engage in transactions with MWE or its Affiliates, joint ventures with third parties, and other future transactions, any or all of which may result in an increase in the value of the Contributed Interest and the Acquirer Parties and their officers, directors, employees and Affiliates may possess material non-public information relating to the foregoing or other matters that is not known to the Contributor and may impact the value of the Contributed Interest; and 

  

 (iv) in light of the foregoing, the Contributor understands, based on its experience, the disadvantage to which the Contributor is subject due to the disparity of information between the Contributor and the Acquirer Parties and, notwithstanding this, the Contributor has deemed it appropriate to engage in the Transaction based on its own independent review and consultations with such investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisers as it deemed necessary, without reliance on any representation or warranty of, or advice from, the Acquirer Parties, other than the representations and warranties of the Acquirer Parties in _Article IV_, which representations and warranties constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the Acquirer Parties in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

  

 (b) After the Closing, the Contributor hereby releases and discharges each Acquirer Party, its Affiliates, directors, officers, partners, members, equityholders and employees (former or present) and their respective successors, heirs and assigns, from any and all Claims and Losses, known or unknown, that have accrued or may accrue and that arise out of or relate to the matters described in this _Section 5.8_. 

   

 (c) The Acquirer Parties acknowledge and agree, for and on behalf of themselves and their respective Affiliates, that the Contributor shall not be responsible or liable for any capital contributions to the Company that were due and payable or will become due and payable, prior to, on, or after the date of this Agreement pursuant to Article IV of the Company LLC Agreement or otherwise. 

  

 (d) The Contributor hereby consents, on behalf of itself and on behalf of the Class A Managers designated by the Contributor, to **, and the Company and the Contributor acknowledge and agree that the Contributor shall have no rights or obligations in respect of **.
