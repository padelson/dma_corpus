ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company. The Company
will be the surviving corporation in the Merger and will continue its
corporate existence under the  



 

1  Laws of the State of Delaware. As of the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease.



1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger will become effective as set forth in the
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") that will be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date. The
term " _Effective Time_ " will be the date and time when the Merger becomes
effective as set forth in the Certificate of Merger.



1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger will
have the effects set forth in DGCL Section 259.



1.4 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, Merger
Sub or any holder of Company Common Stock:



(a)  _Conversion of Shares_. Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Common Stock_ ")
(except for shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 1.4(c)) will, at the Effective Time, be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. " _Merger Consideration_ " means 0.2 of a
share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Parent (the " _Parent Class A Common Stock_ ").



(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be
cancelled and retired and will cease to exist and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ")
will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and any additional cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
Section 2.2, without interest. Certificates previously representing shares of
Company Common Stock will be exchanged for certificates representing whole
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock (" _Parent Certificates_ ") and cash in
lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender
of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest
thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the number of outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock has been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged
for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split or other similar change in
capitalization, notwithstanding any prohibitions thereon in this Agreement
and the Closing nonetheless occurs, an appropriate and proportionate
adjustment will be made to the Exchange Ratio. If, prior to the Effective
Time, the number of outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock has been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind
of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in
 



 

2  capitalization, notwithstanding any prohibitions thereon in this Agreement
and the Closing nonetheless occurs, an appropriate and proportionate
adjustment will be made to the Exchange Ratio.



(c) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. Notwithstanding anything in the
Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common
Stock that are owned by the Company or Parent or any of their respective
wholly owned Subsidiaries will be cancelled and will cease to exist and no
stock of Parent or other consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.



(d) _Alternative Structure_. Parent may at any time change the method of
effecting the combination (including by providing for the merger of
the Company directly into Parent) so long as such change is consented to by
the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), and no such change
shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of Merger Consideration to be
issued to holders of the capital stock of the Company as provided for in this
Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Companys
stockholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration or the Tax
treatment of either party pursuant to this Agreement, or (iii) materially
delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
require additional material consents or approvals.



1.5 _Parent Capital Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
capital stock of Parent (" _Parent Capital Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain issued and outstanding and
will not be affected by the Merger.



1.6 _Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub ("
_Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation will thereby become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.



1.7 _Warrants_. Effective as of the Effective Time, the outstanding Company
Warrant will be assumed by Parent and will be converted into a warrant to
purchase a number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock at a price in each
case determined pursuant to the terms of the Company Warrant and in accordance
with the provisions set forth therein (the " _Assumed Warrant_ "). Except as
otherwise provided therein, the Assumed Warrant will be subject to the same
terms and conditions (including expiration date, vesting and exercise
provisions) as were applicable to the Company Warrant immediately prior to
the Effective Time.



1.8 _Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub attached hereto
as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Merger Sub Charter_ ") will be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable Law, except that such certificate of incorporation
will be amended to change the name of the Surviving Corporation to "Exult,
Inc."



 

3 1.9 _Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws
of Merger Sub attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Merger Sub Bylaws_ ")
will be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable Law.



1.10 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until the next annual meeting (or the earlier of
their resignation or removal) and until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal and until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 



ARTICLE II



EXCHANGE OF SHARES



2.1 _Parent to Make Shares Available_. At or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to Parent Certificates, and promptly thereafter with respect to cash
in lieu of fractional shares, Parent will deposit, or will cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company selected by Parent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II, Parent Certificates and cash in
lieu of fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto, being referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), to be issued
pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to Section 2.2(e), respectively, in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.



2.2 _Exchange of Shares_. (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent will mail to each holder of record of one or more
Certificates a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify,
among other things, that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for Parent Certificates and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares into which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Certificates have been converted pursuant
to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for
exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly
completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
or Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
applicable, (i) a Parent Certificate representing the number of whole shares
of Parent Class A Common Stock to which such holder of Company Common Stock
has become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I, (ii) a check
representing the amount of any cash in lieu of fractional shares which
such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and
(iii) a check representing the amount of any dividends or distributions then
payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(i), and the Certificate or Certificates so
surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or  



 

4  accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends
and distributions payable to holders of Certificates.



(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Class
A Common Stock will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
until the holder thereof surrenders such Certificate in accordance with this
Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Article II, the record holder thereof will be entitled to receive (i) the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid, without any interest thereon, with respect to
the whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock represented by such
Certificate and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender, with respect to
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock represented by such Certificate.



(c) If any Parent Certificate is to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or
are registered, it will be a condition to the issuance thereof that the
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered are properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange pays to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the issuance of a Parent Certificate in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required
for any other reason, or establishes to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.



(d) After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Capital Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Company Common Stock that
occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, they will be cancelled and exchanged for Parent Certificates
as provided in this Article II.



(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock will be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock will be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of
a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Parent will pay to each former stockholder of the Company who otherwise
would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded
to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying the Specified Deal Value by
the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Parent Class A Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Specified Deal Value_ " means the weighted average of the
closing sale  



 

5  prices of Parent Class A Common Stock on the NYSE Composite Transactions
Tape as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the ten full NYSE trading
days immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time.



(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the former
stockholders of the Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time
will be paid to Parent. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II will thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent
Class A Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock, as the case may be, that such stockholder holds as determined pursuant
to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person will be liable to any
former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in
good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.



(g) In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Class
A Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.



(h) The Exchange Agent will invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments will be paid to Parent.

Statements_ "), and no Company Report or Company Public Statement filed,
mailed or published since January 1, 2001, as of the date of such Company
Report or Company Public Statement, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
All Company Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act since
January 1, 2001, as of their respective dates, complied as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto.



3.6 _Financial Statements_. (a) The Company has previously made available to
Parent copies of (i) the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity
and cash flows for the years then ended as reported in the Companys Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 (such
financial statements, the " _Company 2003 Financial_  



 

11   _Statements_ ") filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act, accompanied by
the audit reports of KPMG LLP and Arthur Andersen LLP, as
applicable, independent public accountants with respect to the Company, and
(ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
income and cash flows of the three-month periods then ended, as reported in
the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended
March 31, 2004 (the " _Company Interim Financial Statements_ ," and together
with the Company 2003 Financial Statements, the " _Company Financial
Statements_ "). The December 31, 2003 consolidated balance sheet of the
Company (including the related notes, where applicable) included in the
Company Financial Statements fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
of the date thereof, and the other financial statements included in the
Company Financial Statements (including the related notes, where
applicable) fairly present in all material respects the results of the
consolidated operations, changes in stockholders equity, cash flows and
consolidated financial position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set
forth, subject in the case of the Company Interim Financial Statements to
normal year-end audit adjustments in amounts that are immaterial in nature and
amount and are consistent with past experience. Each of the Company Financial
Statements (including the related notes, where applicable), as of their
respective dates, complied in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto and each of such statements (including the related
notes, where applicable) has been prepared in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except
as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and
records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions.



(b) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under
means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or accountants (including
all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive
ownership and non-direct control that would not have a materially
adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the
following sentence. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company
(i) has designed disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
information relating to the Company, including the Company Subsidiaries, is
made known to the management of the Company by others within those entities
and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company
Board (A) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect  



 

12  in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial data and have identified for the Companys auditors any
material weaknesses in internal controls and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal controls. The Company has made available
to Parent a summary of each such disclosure made by management to the
Companys auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2002.



(c) Except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
March 31, 2004 consolidated balance sheet of the Company included in
the Company Interim Financial Statements and for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since March 31, 2004
that are immaterial in nature or amount, since such date, neither the Company
nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due and including any off-balance sheet financings, loans,
indebtedness, make whole or similar liabilities or obligations) that would be
required to be reflected in a consolidated balance sheet of the Company or
would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.



3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as set forth in a final
registration statement, prospectus, report or definitive proxy statement filed
since January 1, 2004 by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act and prior to the Measurement Date:



(a) since December 31, 2003 through and including the date of this Agreement,
no event or events have occurred that have had or would, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; and



(b) since December 31, 2003 through and including the date of this Agreement,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have carried on their
respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course and
have not taken any action or failed to take any action that would have
resulted in a breach of Section 5.1 or 5.2 had such Sections been in effect
since December 31, 2003.



3.8 _Legal Proceedings_. (a) None of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the
Companys knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of
any nature against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.



(b) There is no Injunction, judgment, or regulatory restriction (other than
those of general application that apply to similarly situated business
process outsourcing companies or their Subsidiaries) imposed upon the
Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the assets of the Company or any
of the Company  



 

13  Subsidiaries that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent.



(c) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is subject to any
cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party
to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding
with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is
subject to any order or directive by, or has been ordered to pay any civil
money penalty by, or since January 1, 2001, has adopted any policies,
procedures or board resolutions at the request or suggestion of any Regulatory
Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently restricts in any material
respect the conduct of its business or that in any material manner relates to
its management or its business (each item in this sentence, whether or not set
forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, a " _Company Regulatory Agreement_
"), or is obligated to make any payment or incur any other expense pursuant to
any Company Regulatory Agreement, nor has the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2001 by any Regulatory Agency or
other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating,
ordering, or requesting any such Company Regulatory Agreement.



 

3.9 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. (a) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
duly filed all federal, state, foreign and local information returns and Tax
Returns required to be filed by them on or prior to the date of this Agreement
(all such returns being accurate and complete in all material respects) and
have duly paid or made provision for the payment of all Taxes that have
been incurred or are due or claimed to be due from them by federal, state,
foreign or local taxing authorities other than (i) Taxes that are not yet
delinquent or are being contested in good faith, have not been finally
determined and have been adequately reserved against or (ii) information
returns, Tax Returns or Taxes as to which the failure to file, pay or make
provision for would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter
lists those Tax Returns that are currently the subject of audit by the
Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") or for which written notice of intent
to audit has been received from the IRS. Any liability with respect to
deficiencies asserted as a result of any such audit is covered by adequate
reserves in accordance with GAAP in the Company Financial Statements. Section
3.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth all material elections with
respect to Taxes affecting the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as
of the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has waived any statute of
limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency. There are no material disputes
pending, or claims asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries for which the Company does not have adequate
reserves. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party
to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively
between or among the Company and the Company Subsidiaries). Within the past
five years, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has been a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
distribution intended to qualify under  



 

14  Section 355(a) of the Code. No disallowance of a deduction under Section
162(m) of the Code for employee remuneration of any amount paid or payable by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under any contract, plan,
program or arrangement or understanding would, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and each
of the Company Subsidiaries have withheld and paid all material Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or any
other third party. The Company does not have and has not had any permanent
establishment in any foreign country as defined in the applicable Tax treaty
or convention between the United States and such foreign country. The Company
is not a party to any joint venture, partnership or other arrangement
or contract which could be treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes. No item of income or gain reported by the Company for financial
accounting purposes in any pre-closing period is required to be included in
taxable income for a post-closing period. Neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has any excess loss account (as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-19) with respect to the stock of any Subsidiary
which would give rise to a material tax liability.



(b) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Tax_ " or " _Taxes_ " means (i)
all federal, state, local and foreign income, excise, gross receipts, gross
income, ad valorem, profits, gains, property, capital, sales, transfer, use,
payroll, employment, severance, withholding, duties, intangibles, franchise,
backup withholding and other taxes, charges, levies or like assessments
together with all penalties and additions to tax and interest thereon and (ii)

Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) and
the term " _Tax Return_ " includes all returns, reports and forms (including
elections, declarations, disclosures, schedules, estimates and information
returns) required to be filed with or supplied to a Tax authority relating to
Taxes.



(c) The limitation under Section 382 of the Code, Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-15 or 21 or otherwise on the use of net operating loss
carryforwards of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that may apply by
reason of the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not be reduced by virtue of any prior transaction or change in ownership of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. For the purposes of this
Section 3.9(c), the Section 382 limitation that may apply by reason of the
Merger or other transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be based on
the fair market value of the Company Common Stock on the date of this
Agreement.

Company or the Company Subsidiaries, (iii) any plan or agreement of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries relating to any of its current or former
employees, consultants or directors (each, an " _Employee_ ") pursuant to
which benefits would vest or an amount would become payable or the terms of
which would otherwise be altered, in any case by virtue of the  



 

15  transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of
any additional or subsequent events), (iv) each document embodying each
Retirement Plan of the Company, and (v) each stock option plan, stock award
plan, stock appreciation right plan, phantom stock plan, stock option, other
equity or equity-based compensation plan, equity or other equity based award
to any Person (whether payable in cash, shares or otherwise) or other plan or
Contract of any nature with any Person (whether or not an Employee) pursuant
to which any stock, option, warrant or other right to purchase or acquire
capital stock of the Company or right to payment based on the value of the
Company capital stock has been granted or otherwise issued. The Company has
delivered or made available to Parent for review each of the items listed on
Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. For purposes of
this Agreement, (A) " _Retirement Plan_ " shall mean a material arrangement
for the provision of Retirement Benefit Rights to Employees (and, if
applicable, beneficiaries thereof) and (B) " _Retirement Benefit Rights_ "
shall mean, with respect to any Person, any pension, lump sum, gratuity or a
like benefit provided or generally intended to be provided on retirement or on
death in respect of an Employees relationship as a service provider to such
Person or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _that_ (x) material post-retirement

or any of its Subsidiaries. With respect to any Benefit Plan of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries ("Company Benefit Plans"), no event has
occurred and there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in connection
with which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries would be subject to
any material liability under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), the Code or any other applicable Law.



(ii) Each Company Benefit Plan has been, in all material respects,
administered and operated in accordance with its terms, with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable material Laws and the
terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements. Each Company Benefit
Plan, including any material amendments thereto, that is capable of approval
by, and/or registration for and/or qualification for special tax status with,
the appropriate taxation, social security and/or supervisory authorities in
the relevant country, state, territory or the like (each, an " _Approval_ ")
has received such Approval or there remains a period of time in which to
obtain such Approval retroactive to the date of any material amendment or
change in Law that has not previously received such Approval.



 

16 (iii) To the knowledge of the Company, no material commitment with respect to
any material aspect of any Company Benefit Plan has been made to an Employee
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries by an authorized Employee of
the Company that is not materially in accordance with the written or otherwise
preexisting terms and provisions of such Company Benefit Plans. To the
knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding,
whether written or oral, with any trade union, works council or
other Employee representative body or any material number or category of its
Employees which would prevent, restrict or materially impede the

its or their respective workforces (or any part of them).

or in connection with, any Company Benefit Plan (other than routine undisputed
claims for benefits), and no action, legal or otherwise, has been commenced
with respect to any material claim thereunder. 



(c) _Pensions_. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to,
contributes to, or will be required to contribute to, any material scheme,
agreement or arrangement (whether legally enforceable or not) for the
provision of any pension, retirement savings benefits or other like
benefits (including the payment after leaving employment of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary of medical expenses) for any Employee or for the widow,
widower, child or dependant of any such Employee. To the knowledge of the
Company, the scheme relating to U.K. employees discussed in Section 3.10(c)
of the Company Disclosure Letter has been operated in compliance with
applicable Law and the Company has no due and unpaid obligations in respect of
it.



(d) _Defined Benefit Plans; Multiemployer Plans_. No Company Benefit Plan is

4001(a)(13) of ERISA or Section 414(f) of the Code, or (iv) a "multiple
employer plan" within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code.



(e) _Continuation Coverage_. No Company Benefit Plan provides health benefits
(whether or not insured), with respect to Employees after retirement or other
termination of service (other than coverage mandated by applicable Laws or
benefits, the full cost of which is borne by the Employee) other than
individual arrangements the amounts of which are not material.



(f) _Effect of Transaction_. The execution of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (either
alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events)
constitute an event under any Company Benefit Plan that will or may result in
any material payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of
payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Employee. There is
no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement with an  



 

17  Employee to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party
as of the date of this Agreement, that, individually or collectively and as
a result of the transaction contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or subsequent events), would reasonably be
expected to give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the Code, except as set forth in
Section 3.10(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter.



(g) _Labor_. No collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated or
renegotiated in any material respect by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no material labor
dispute, strike or work stoppage against the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened which may
materially interfere with the respective business activities of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, to the
knowledge of the Company, none of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries
or any of their respective representatives or Employees has committed any
material unfair labor practice in connection with the operation of the
respective businesses of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and
there is no material charge or complaint against the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries by the National Labor Relations Board or any comparable
governmental agency pending or threatened in writing.



3.11 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. The Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries hold all licenses, franchises, permits, variances, orders,
approvals and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their
respective businesses under and pursuant to each, and have complied in all
respects with and are not in default in any respect under any, applicable Law
of any Governmental Entity relating to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold such license, franchise,
permit, variance, order, approval or authorization or such noncompliance or
default would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.



3.12 _Certain Contracts_. (a) Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter
lists each contract, undertaking, arrangement, commitment or understanding
(whether written or oral) to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party or by which they are bound (i) that is a "material

services during the year ended December 31, 2003, or pursuant to which the
Company reasonably expects to receive or make such aggregate payments during
the year ending December 31, 2004, in each case in excess of $5,000,000 per
contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (or series of related

good and marketable title to all the properties and assets reflected in the
latest balance sheet included in the Company Interim Financial Statements as

statements required to be filed by them since January 1, 2001, including any
report or statement required to be filed pursuant to the Laws of the United
States, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due
and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such
report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments would

Parent. No Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or,
to the knowledge of Parent, investigation into the business or operations of
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries since January 1, 2001, except where

form with all applicable legal requirements and did not contain any untrue

date of such Parent Report or Parent Public Statement, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. All
Parent Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act since
January 1, 2001, as of their respective dates, complied as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto.



4.6 _Financial Statements_. (a) Parent has previously made available to the
Company copies of (i) the consolidated balance sheet of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries (or, as applicable, their predecessors) as of September 30, 2001,
2002 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended as reported in
Parents Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2003 (such financial statements, the " _Parent 2003 Financial Statements_ ")
filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act, accompanied by the audit report of
Ernst and Young LLP, independent public accountants with respect to Parent, and
(ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
income and cash flows of the three-month periods then ended, as reported in
Parents Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March
31, 2004 (the " _Parent Interim Financial Statements_ ," and together with
the Parent 2003 Financial Statements, the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ").
The September 30, 2003 consolidated balance sheet of Parent (including
the related notes, where applicable) included in the Parent Financial
Statements fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries as of the date thereof, and the
other financial statements referred to in this Section 4.6 (including the
related notes, where applicable) fairly present in all material respects the
results of the consolidated operations, cash flows and changes in
stockholders equity and consolidated financial position of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of  



 

26  the respective dates therein set forth, subject in the case of the Parent
Interim Financial Statements to normal year-end audit adjustments in amounts
that are immaterial in nature and amount and are consistent with past
experience. Each of the Parent Financial Statements (including the related
notes, where applicable), as of their respective dates, complied in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and each of
such statements (including the related notes, where applicable) has been

Parent Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under
means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially
adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the
following sentence. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Parent (i) has
designed disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
information relating to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is
made known to the management of Parent by others within those entities and
(ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
hereof, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (A)
any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls
which could adversely affect in any material respect Parents ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for
Parents auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Parents internal controls. Parent has made
available to the Company a summary of any such disclosure made by management
to Parents auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2002.

March 31, 2004 consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in the Parent
Interim Financial Statements and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since March 31, 2004, since
such date, neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries has incurred any
liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due and including any off balance
sheet financings, loans, indebtedness, make whole or similar liabilities or
obligations) that would be required to be reflected in a consolidated  



 

27  balance sheet of Parent or would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent;



4.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as set forth in a final
registration statement, prospectus, report or definitive proxy statement filed
since January 1, 2004 with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act and prior to the Measurement Date:



(a) since September 30, 2003 through and including the date of
this Agreement, no event or events have occurred that have had or would have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent; and



(b) since September 30, 2003 through and including the date of this Agreement,
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have carried on their
respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course and
have not taken any action or failed to take any action that would have
resulted in a breach of Section 5.3 had such Section been in effect since
September 30, 2003.



4.8 _Legal Proceedings_. (a) None of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a
party to any, and there are no pending or, to the best of Parents knowledge,
threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims,
actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.



(b) There is no Injunction, judgment, or regulatory restriction (other than
those of general application that apply to similarly situated human
resources outsourcing companies or their Subsidiaries) imposed upon Parent,
any Parent Subsidiary or the assets of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary that
would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.



(c) Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is subject to
any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement action issued by, or is a
party to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of
understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar
undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has been
ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or since January 1, 2001, has
adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or
suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity
that currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business
or that in any material manner relates to its management or its business
(each, whether or not set forth in the Parent Disclosure Letter, a " _Parent
Regulatory Agreement_ "), or is obligated to make any payment or incur any
other expense pursuant to any Parent Regulatory Agreement, nor has Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2001, by any
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is considering
issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such Parent Regulatory
Agreement.



4.9 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Parent and each of the Parent
Subsidiaries hold all licenses, franchises, permits, variances, orders,
approvals and  



 

28  authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective
businesses under and pursuant to each, and have complied in all respects with
and are not in default in any respect under any, applicable Law of any
Governmental Entity relating to Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries,
except where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit, variance,
order, approval or authorization or such noncompliance or default would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.



4.10 _Reorganization_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent is not aware
of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the
Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

Subsidiaries to be contained in the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4,
or the information relating to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries that is or
will be provided by Parent or its representatives for inclusion in any other

statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under

Subsidiaries) will comply with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder in all material respects. The Form S-4 will
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder in all material respects.

this Agreement to the Effective Time, except as expressly contemplated or
permitted by this Agreement or in the Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent and

cash dividends of no more than $0.25 per quarter declared or paid in
connection with a decision by the Parent Board approving the commencement of a

ARTICLE VI



ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



6.1 _Regulatory Matters; Third Party Consents_. (a) Parent and the Company
will promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement and
Parent will promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4 in which the
Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and the
Company will use their commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing, and thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to its
respective stockholders.



(b) Subject to Section 6.13, the parties will cooperate with each other and
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare
and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices,
petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger) and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. The Company and Parent will
have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, all the information relating to the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries,
which appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of
the parties will act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(c) Each of Parent and the Company will, upon request, furnish to the other
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or any
other statement, filing,  



 

34  notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(d) Each of Parent and the Company will promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity consent or approval
of which is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 



6.2 _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of the Company
and Parent will, and will cause each Parent Subsidiary to, afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the
other, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records, and, during such period, the parties will, and will
cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities Laws (other than reports or documents that such party is not
permitted to disclose under applicable Law) and (ii) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other may reasonably
request. Neither the Company nor Parent nor any of their Subsidiaries will be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its
Subsidiaries or contravene any Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. The parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.



(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement will be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered into
between the Company and Parent as of March 12, 2004 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").



(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives will affect the representations and warranties of the other
set forth in this Agreement.



6.3  _Stockholder Approvals_. Each of the Company and Parent will call a
meeting of its stockholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for
the purpose of obtaining the requisite stockholder approvals required in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger, and each will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably
practicable on the same date. Each of the Company Board and the Parent Board
will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its respective
stockholders the Company Stockholder Approval and Parent Stockholder Approval.
The Parent Board will recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of the
Share Issuance, and the Company Board will recommend that its
stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, subject to
their respective fiduciary duties in connection with any Parent Acquisition
Proposal in the case of the Parent Board, or, in  



 

35  the case of the Company Board, subject to its fiduciary duties in respect of
a Superior Proposal and in compliance by the Company with Section 6.12.
Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit Parent or the Company from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. In addition, without limiting the
generality or effect of the foregoing, nothing herein will restrict any party
from disclosing to its stockholders information that its Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with counsel, it is required to
disclose under applicable Law.



6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject to Section 6.13, each of Parent and
the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, use their commercially
reasonable efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary,
proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may
be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to obtain (and to
cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental
Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by the
Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



6.5 _Affiliate Letters_. The Company will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other Person who is an
"affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of the
Company to deliver to Parent, as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, and prior to the date of the meeting of the Company stockholders to
be held pursuant to Section 6.3, a written agreement, in the form of 
_Exhibit C_.



6.6 _NYSE Listing_. Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be issued, or reserved for
issuance, in connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.



6.7 _Employee Matters_. (a) From the Effective Time through the first
anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Benefits Provision Date_ "), except
for participation in equity plans (which is covered by Section 6.7(b)), Parent
will, or will cause the Company to, provide employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the " _Covered Employees_ ")
employee benefits and compensation plans, programs and arrangements that, in
Parents reasonable judgment, in the aggregate (giving effect to the benefits
and compensation to be provided pursuant to Section 6.7(b)) are not
substantially less valuable to Covered Employees than are the employee
benefits and compensation, excluding severance arrangements, plans, programs
and arrangements provided by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, to such employees as of the Measurement Date, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that subject to Section 6.7(b), prior to the Benefits Provision
Date Parent will be deemed to be in compliance with this covenant if it makes
provision so that Covered Employees become eligible to participate in benefit
plans provided to similarly situated  



 

36  employees of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries and nothing therein or
otherwise will affect the at-will employment status of any employee.



(b) Each of Parent and the Company will take the actions indicated to
be taken by it on _Exhibit 6.7(b)_ at or prior to the times specified
therein.



(c) The Company shall take all necessary and appropriate actions with respect
to the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan so that the offering period ending
June 30, 2004, is the final offering period for which shares of Company
Common Stock are issued under such plan.



6.8  _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) After the
Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which
any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or who is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another Person (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in
part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact
that such individual is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, such Indemnified Parties
against such claims, actions, suits or proceedings, to the fullest extent that
would be permitted under applicable Delaware corporate Law (including
reimbursement for reasonable fees and expenses incurred in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party). From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will
cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, the
Indemnified Parties as provided in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws
in effect on the date hereof, and any agreement specifically listed in Section
6.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter, _provided_ ,  _however_ , to the extent
any such matter arises out of service by any individual as a director or
officer of Parent as of or after the Merger, such indemnity shall be provided
in accordance with the Parent Charter and Parent Bylaws, as in effect from
time to time, and any director and officer indemnification agreements between
Parent and such person.



(b) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the individuals
covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six
years after the Effective Time by the directors and officers liability
insurance as in effect on the Measurement Date, and if that is not
practicable, then such insurance not substantially less favorable to the
insureds than the policy maintained by the Company as of the Measurement Date
(such other insurance may include so-called "tail" policies, of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous than the  



 

37  Companys policy as in effect on the Measurement Date) with respect to acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that were committed
by such officers and directors in their capacity as such, and _provided
further_ , that in no event will Parent be required to expend in any year an
amount in excess of 150% of the annual aggregate premiums currently paid by
the Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance
coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual
premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent will maintain policies of
directors and officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to
the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parents obligations under
this Section 6.8(b) will be deemed satisfied to the extent that any such
individual is covered for all such periods with respect to such acts or
omissions under any directors and officers liability insurance policy
maintained by Parent for its directors and officers.



(c) This Section 6.8 will survive the Effective Time and is expressly intended
to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding
on Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and
assigns. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the obligations set forth
with respect to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in
this Section 6.8.



6.9 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of the
Company, the proper officers and directors of each party and their respective
Subsidiaries will take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by, and at the sole expense of, Parent.



6.10 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Parent and the Company will promptly advise
the other of any change or event (a) having or reasonably likely to have a
Parent MAE or a Company MAE, as the case may be, or (b) that it believes would
or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any
of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no such notification will affect the
representations, warranties or covenants of the parties (or remedies
with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement and (ii) a failure to comply with this Section 6.10 will
not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be
satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach
would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article
VII to be satisfied.



6.11 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Parent and the Company
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain
Company Insiders in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the
Effective Time, it is desirable that  



 

38  Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b)
of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law
in connection with the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock into
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock in the Merger, and for that compensatory
and retentive purposes agree to the provisions of this Section 6.11. Assuming
that the Company delivers to Parent the Section 16 Information in a timely
fashion, the Parent Board, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof
(as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange
Act), will adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by Company Insiders
of Parent Class A Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent
such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, is intended to be
exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. For
purposes of this Agreement, (a) " _Section 16 Information_ " will mean
information accurate in all material respects regarding Company Insiders, the
number of shares of Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted Stock)
held by each such Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for Parent
Class A Common Stock in the Merger, and the number and description of Company
Stock Options held by each such Company Insider and expected to be cashed-out
in connection with the Merger and (b) " _Company Insiders_ " will mean those
officers and directors of the Company who are subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the
Section 16 Information.



6.12 _No Shop_. (a) Except as otherwise permitted in this Section 6.12, the
Company will not, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries and each officer,
director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way
of furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate any
inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including,
without limitation, by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions
involving the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that, if consummated,
would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or
proposals being referred to herein as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative
Transaction, or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Alternative
Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board will be
permitted, prior to obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, and subject to
compliance with the other terms of this Section 6.12 and to first entering
into a confidentiality agreement with the Person proposing such Acquisition
Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to the
Company than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, in response to
a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably
lead to, a Superior Proposal to consider and participate in discussions and
negotiations with respect to such proposal and provide information in
connection therewith.



 

39 (b) As used in this Agreement:



(i) " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (i) a transaction pursuant to
which any Person (or group of persons) other than Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 10%
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or outstanding voting power
or of any new series or new class of preferred stock that would be entitled
to a class or series vote with respect to the Merger, whether from the Company
or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination
involving the Company (other than the Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant
to which any Person (or group of persons) other than Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this
purpose the outstanding equity securities of the Company Subsidiaries and
securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination
involving any Company Subsidiary) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
representing more than 10% of the fair market value of all the assets, net
revenues or net income of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, immediately prior to such transaction, (iv) any other consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, as a result of which the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock immediately prior to such transaction do not, in the aggregate, own at
least 90% of each of the outstanding shares of common stock and the
outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in such
transaction immediately after the consummation thereof, or (v) any other
transaction that is conditioned or predicated on the Merger not being
completed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or is intended or
could reasonably be expected to result in the Merger not being so completed (
_provided_ , _however_ , that any transfers among General Atlantic Partners
and its affiliates shall not be deemed an Alternative Transaction); and



(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written proposal (not solicited
by or on behalf of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any
officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained
representative) of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
otherwise resulting from a breach of Section 6.12(a)) made by a third party
after the date of this Agreement that if consummated would result in such
third party (or its stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly, more than
50% of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (or of the
surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving
entity in a merger) or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) to be (A) more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view
than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking
into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement
including any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to such offer or otherwise) and (B) reasonably capable of
being  



 

40  completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal.



(c) The Company will notify Parent promptly as practicable (but in no
event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
material modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or
any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of the
Company or the Board of Directors of any Company Subsidiary by any Person that
informs the Company Board or any Company Subsidiary that it is considering
making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Parent will be
made orally and in writing, and will indicate the identity of the Person
making the Acquisition Proposal or intending to make or considering making an
Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the
books and records of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and the material
terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or modification or amendment to an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company will (i) keep Parent informed, on a
reasonably current basis, of any material changes in the status and any
material changes or modifications in the terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Company from
any third party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or sent or
provided by the Company to any third party in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company will also promptly as practicable, and in
any event within 24 hours, notify Parent, orally and in writing, if it enters
into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal in
accordance with Section 6.12(a). 



(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof will (i) (A) withdraw
(or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) the recommendation by the Company
Board or any such committee of this Agreement and the Merger, (B) determine
that this Agreement or the Merger is no longer advisable, (C) recommend that
the stockholders of the Company reject this Agreement or the Merger, or (D)
resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such actions, or (E) recommend
the approval or adoption of any Acquisition Proposal, unless in each case, a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably
lead to, a Superior Proposal has been made and the Company Board or a
committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that failure to take any such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) adopt or approve any
Acquisition Proposal, or withdraw its approval of this Agreement or the
Merger, or resolve or agree to take any such actions, (iii) without limiting
Section 6.12(d)(i), propose publicly to adopt or approve any Acquisition
Proposal or propose publicly to withdraw its approval of this Agreement or the
Merger or resolve or agree to take any such actions, or (iv) cause or permit
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is
reasonably likely to lead to, any Alternative Acquisition or Acquisition
Proposal (other  



 

41  than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.12(a)) or resolve
or agree to take any such actions (each Board action set forth in
clauses (i)-(iv) of this Section 6.12(d) being referred to herein as an "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may in
response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a
Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) and
concurrently approve, recommend and authorize the Company to enter into a
binding Alternative Acquisition Agreement containing the terms of a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) the Company Board may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h), and any purported
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(h) will be void and of no force or
effect, unless the Company has complied with all provisions of this Section
6.12, including the notification provisions in this Section 6.12, and with all
applicable requirements of Sections 9.3(b) (including the payment of the
Company Termination Fee prior to or simultaneously with such termination) and
(2) the Company may not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(h), (x) until after the second business day following
Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the
Company Board has received a Superior Proposal and that the Company Board
will, subject to any action taken by Parent pursuant to this sentence, cause
the Company to accept such Superior Proposal, which notice will specify the
terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and identify the Person making
such Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the price or any other material
term of a Superior Proposal will require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and
a new two business day period), and (y) unless after such second business day
such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and the Company Board so
determines in accordance with the definition of "Superior Proposal."
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless and until this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Section 8.1, nothing in this Section 6.12 will affect
the obligations of the Company or the rights of Parent or Merger Sub under
any other provision of this Agreement, including the Companys obligation to
seek the Company Stockholder Approval pursuant to Section 6.3.



(e) The Company will, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries and its
or their officers, directors, agents or representatives (including any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained
representative) to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Parent and its
representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing,
and will use reasonable best efforts to cause all persons other than Parent
who have been furnished confidential information regarding the Company in
connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Acquisition
Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or
destroy such information. The Company agrees not to, and to cause the Company
Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from the confidentiality and
standstill provisions of any agreement to which the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and will immediately take all
steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given
under any such provisions authorizing any Person to make an Acquisition
Proposal, unless the Company Board determines in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably lead to, a Superior Proposal.



 

42 (f) The Company will ensure that the officers, directors and all employees,
agents and representatives (including any investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants or other retained representatives) of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in
this Section 6.12 as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is
understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
6.12 by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including
any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other retained representative) of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, at
the direction or with the consent of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries,
will be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.12 by the Company.

waiver will be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on

strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition will
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

termination Parent was otherwise entitled to terminate this Agreement.



(f) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section
9.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if either party fails promptly to pay the amounts due
pursuant to Section 9.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, the non-
breaching party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
breaching party for the amounts set forth in Section 9.3, the breaching party
will pay to the non-breaching party interest on the amounts set forth in
Section 9.3 at a rate per annum equal to three-month LIBOR (as reported in The

other schedules and all exhibits hereto, will be deemed part of this Agreement
and included in any reference to this Agreement. This Agreement will not be
interpreted or construed to require any Person to take any action, or fail to
take any action, if to do so would violate any applicable Law. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere inclusion of an item
therein as an exception to a representation or warranty will not be deemed an
admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item has had or would, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent, as the
case may be.



(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or

Agreement.



9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more

will become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that each party
need not sign the same counterpart.



9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to in this Agreement), together with the

transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld) of Parent, in the case of a
proposed announcement or statement by the Company, or the Company, in the case
of a proposed announcement or statement by Parent or Merger Sub;  _provided_
, _however_ , that either party may, without the prior consent of the other
party (but after prior consultation with the other party to the extent
practicable under the circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement to the extent required by Law or

entitled to vote thereon, having not less than the minimum number of votes
that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled
to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate

consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered
to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its
principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having
custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are
recorded. Delivery made to a Corporations registered office shall be by hand
or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record
date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of
Directors is required by law, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be
at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution taking such prior action. 



(c) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any
other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which
record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty
days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
relating thereto.

8 Exhibit C

 





Form of Affiliate Letter



Hewitt Associates, Inc.

 

100 Half Day Road

Lincolnshire, IL 60069

Attention: Dale L. Gifford

Bryan J. Doyle



Ladies and Gentlemen:



I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Exult, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), as
the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule
145 of the Rules and Regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "). I have been further advised
that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
June 15, 2004 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among Hewitt Associates,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Eagle Merger Corp., a Delaware
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and
the Company, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ ") and each share of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share,
of the Company will be converted into the right to receive 0.2 of a share of
Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Class A
Common Stock_ "). All terms used in this letter but not defined herein will
have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.



I represent, warrant and covenant to Parent that in the event I receive
any Parent Class A Common Stock as a result of the Merger:



(a) I will not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Class A
Common Stock in violation of the Securities Act or the Rules and Regulations.



(b) I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed
its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Class A Common Stock to the
extent I believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for the Company.



(c) I have been advised that the issuance of Parent Class A Common Stock to me
pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the SEC under the
Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-4. However, I have also
been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote
of the stockholders of the Company, I may be deemed to have been an affiliate
of the Company and the distribution by me of Parent Class A Common Stock has
not been registered under the Securities Act, I may not sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of Parent Class A Common Stock issued to me in the Merger
unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under
the Securities Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is  



 

1  made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145
promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act, or (iii) in the opinion of
counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent, such sale, transfer or other
disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities Act.



(d) I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale,
transfer or other disposition of Parent Class A Common Stock by me or on
my behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in
order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available.



(e) I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
Parents transfer agents with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock and
that there will be placed on the certificates for Parent Common Stock issued
to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:



"The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a
transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of
1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with
the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under
said act or an exemption from such registration."



(f) I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Parent Class
A Common Stock has been registered under the Securities Act or is a sale made
in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, Parent reserves the right to
put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:



"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such
shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act
of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view
to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."



It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above will be removed
by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the
issuance of a letter to Parents transfer agent removing such stop transfer
instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will cease to apply, if (A)
one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the
Securities Act or any successor thereto) has elapsed from the Closing Date and
the  



 

2  provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B) if two years (or
such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Securities
Act or any successor thereto) has elapsed from the Effective Time and the
provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C) I have delivered to
Parent (i) a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of
counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or other

4 EXHIBIT 6.7(B)



1\. _Past Service Credit, Etc._ : From and after January 1, 2006, or such
earlier or later date on which Covered Employees become eligible to
participate in benefit plans provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent and Parent Subsidiaries (the " _Benefits Transition Date_ "), Parent
will (i) provide all Covered Employees with service credit for all periods of
employment with the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary that becomes their respective successor) prior to the Benefits
Transition Date (but beginning, if applicable, on such prior date as the
Company has recognized as a service date) for purposes of eligibility,
participation and vesting (but not, in the case of periods of time with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or their predecessor, for severance benefits
or retiree medical credits) under any employee benefit or compensation plan,
program or arrangement adopted, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary (including the Company and Company Subsidiaries) after the
Effective Time in which Covered Employees are eligible to participate, (ii)
where administratively reasonably practicable in Parents judgment, cause any
pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or
required physical examinations under any welfare benefit plans of Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary (including the Company and Company Subsidiaries for
periods after the Effective Time but before the Benefits Transition Date) to
be waived with respect to the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents,
to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which the applicable
Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Benefits Transition
Date and, with respect to life insurance coverage, in no event more than the
Covered Employees current level of insurability, and (iii) where
administratively reasonably practicable in Parents judgment, give the Covered
Employees and their eligible dependents credit for the plan year in which the
Benefits Transition Date (or commencement of participation in a plan of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary) occurs towards applicable deductibles and
annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred for such plan year prior to
the Benefits Transition Date (or the date of commencement of participation in
a plan of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary other than the plans of the Company
and Company Subsidiaries in which Covered Employees participated immediately
prior to the Benefits Transition Date) under any such welfare benefit plan.
For purposes of any cash balance pension plan specifically listed on the
Company Disclosure Letter and maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries in which Covered Employees become eligible to
participate following the Benefits Transition Date (excluding the cash
balance pension plans maintained or sponsored by the Company immediately prior
to the Benefits Transition Date), the Covered Employees level of benefit
accruals under any such plans (for periods of service following the date on
which the Covered Employees commence participation in such plans) will be
determined based on the Covered Employees credited service prior to the
Benefits Transition Date (as recognized for the same purpose by the Company
for purposes of the cash balance pension plans maintained or sponsored by the
Company immediately prior to the Benefits Transition Date) and with the
Surviving Corporation following the Benefits Transition Date.  2\. _Retention Agreements:_ Prior to the execution of the Agreement, the
Company entered into Retention Agreements with Kevin M. Campbell, James C.
Madden, V., Michael J. Salvino and Stephen M. Unterberger (Mr. Campbell, Mr.
Madden, Mr. Salvino and Mr. Unterberger collectively, the " _Group 1
Executives_ ") in substantially the forms previously agreed by
representatives of Parent and the Company. In addition, as soon as practicable
after the execution of this Agreement, Parent understands that the Company
expects to enter into Retention Agreements with John A. Adams, Matthew
Chambers, Brian W. Copple, Bruce W. Ferguson, Robert W. Gunn and Richard H.
Jones (Mr. Adams, Mr. Chambers, Mr. Copple, Mr. Ferguson, Mr. Gunn and Mr.
Jones collectively, the " _Group 2 Executives_ ") in substantially the forms
to be agreed by representatives of Parent and the Company consistent with the
term sheets previously provided to the Company by Parent. Such Retention
Agreements are, or will be, binding but will not become operative unless and
until the Effective Time occurs, whereupon without further action they will
become operative and as provided therein will supersede certain prior
employment, retention or severance agreements between the Company (or any
Company Subsidiary) and the executives party thereto. In addition, Parent
intends to enter into Stockholders Agreements with the Group 2 Executives in
substantially the form of the Stockholders Agreements entered into by the
Group 1 Executives as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
failure of any or all of the Group 2 Executives to sign a Retention Agreement
or a Stockholders Agreement as contemplated hereby will not be deemed to be a
breach of a Company representation, warranty or covenant or a failure of any
condition set forth in Article VII.



3.  _Company Retention Program:_ Promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, the Company will propose potential participants under a Company
Retention Program (" _Retention Program_ "), subject to approval of Parent.
Under the Retention Program, if the Closing occurs, participants will be
awarded an opportunity to receive up to a number of restricted shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock equal to up to $11.7 million divided by the
Specified Deal Value (as defined below) which, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Retention Program, will vest if the participant continues to
be employed by the Company or any Parent Subsidiary through June 27, 2006. The
terms and conditions of the Retention Program will be developed by Parent in
consultation with the Company. The Retention Program referred to in this
Section 3 is in addition to the retention arrangements referred to in Section
2.



4\. _Outstanding Options; Restricted Stock:_ (a) At the Effective Time, each
holder of a then outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted pursuant to
the Company Stock Plans, whether or not then exercisable, will, in settlement
thereof, receive from the Company for each share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option an amount (subject to any applicable
withholding tax) in cash equal to the difference between (i) the Specified
Deal Value multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and (ii) the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock of such Company Stock Option to the extent such
difference is a positive number (such amount being hereinafter referred to as,
the " _Company Option Consideration_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Specified Deal Value_ " means the weighted average of the closing sale prices
of Parent Class A Common Stock on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape as



 

-2- reported by The Wall Street Journal for the ten full NYSE trading days
immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time. At the Effective Time,
each outstanding and unexercised Company Stock Option will be canceled whether
or not the holder thereof is entitled to Company Option Consideration under
this Section 4 and the holders of Company Stock Options will have no further
rights in respect of any Company Stock Options. For purposes of this _Exhibit
6.7(b)_ , " _Company Stock Plans_ " means the Companys 1999 Stock
Option/Stock Issuance Plan, 1999 Special Executive Stock
Option/Stock Issuance Plan, 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and any other plan
providing for the award of options or other equity rights.



(b) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock that is a
restricted stock right of any kind, contingent or accrued, granted under
the Company Stock Plans (not including Company Stock Options) (" _Company
Restricted Stock_ "), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted, at the Effective
Time, into shares of Parent Class A Common Stock at the Exchange Ratio
(rounded to the nearest whole share), on the same terms and conditions
(including vesting provisions) as were applicable under the Company Restricted
Stock (but taking into account any changes thereto, including the
acceleration thereof, provided for in the Company Stock Plans or in any award
agreement thereunder by reason of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby).



(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain all necessary consents or
releases from holders of Company Stock Options under the Company Stock Plans
or holders of Company Restricted Stock requested by Parent in good faith and
(ii) take all such other lawful action as may be requested by Parent in good
faith to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 4.
Except as otherwise agreed to by Parent and the Company, (A) the Company Stock
Plans will terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other
plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any
Company Restricted Stock or any other interest in respect of the capital stock
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary will be canceled as of the Effective
Time and (B) the Company will ensure that following the Effective Time no
participant in the Company Stock Plans, Company Benefit Plan or such other
plans, programs or arrangements has any right thereunder to acquire any equity
securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
thereof and to terminate all such plans and any Company Options, any Company
Restricted Stock or other rights thereunder.



_5\. Part-Year Incentive Bonuses:_ The Company, upon approval of the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board and its determination that the
applicable performance criteria have been met for the relevant period (pro
rated, if determined to be appropriate), may pay up to $4.0 million (the "
_Performance Cap_ ") in performance bonuses at or prior to the Effective Time
for periods between the beginning of the Companys current fiscal year and the
Effective Time, including (notwithstanding Section 5.2 of the Agreement) to
executive officers of the Company. Parent will consult in good faith with the
Company in the event that the Compensation Committee determines that the
Performance Cap should be increased by up to 50%, but will have no obligation
to agree to any such increase.
