RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their respective corporations and shareholders that the Company and Parent engage in a business combination; and 

  

 WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have approved this Agreement and the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with and into the Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

  

THE MERGER; CERTAIN RELATED MATTERS

    

 Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with Section 1701.78 and 1701.81 of the Ohio Revised Code (the " _OGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (with respect to all post-Closing periods, the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the OGCL, including Section 1701.82. 

  

 Section 1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP, 919 Third Avenue, New York, New York at 9:00 a.m. New York City time on the third Business Day after all of the conditions set forth in Article VII have been fulfilled or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) in accordance with this Agreement, or at such other place 

   ##### 

  

    

and time and/or on such other date as the Company and Parent may agree in
writing (the " _Closing Date_ "). 

  

 Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall duly execute and file a certificate of merger, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the OGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), together with any required related certificates, with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio (the " _OSOS_ ") in accordance with the OGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the OSOS on the Closing Date, or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the OGCL. As used herein, the " _Effective Time_ " shall mean the time at which the Merger shall become effective. 

  

 Section 1.4. _Articles of Incorporation_. The articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at the Effective Time to be in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto and, as so amended and restated, such articles of incorporation shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Articles of Incorporation_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

  

 Section 1.5. _Code of Regulations_. The code of regulations of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Code of Regulations_ ") until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

  

 Section 1.6. _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and the Code of Regulations. 

  

 Section 1.7. _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and the Code of Regulations. 

  

 Section 1.8. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof (other than the requisite approval of the Merger by the shareholders of the Company in accordance with the OGCL): 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Shares_ ") (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $44 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "); 

  

 (b) all Shares (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired, and each certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to such Shares formerly represented thereby; 

  

 (c) each Excluded Share shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and 

  

 (d) each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and such shares shall constitute the only issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.9. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_. 

  

 (a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, the right to receive shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of any stock options (each, a " _Company Option_ ") granted pursuant to the Companys 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, 2005 Incentive Plan, 2000 Directors Plan, 1999 Broad-Based Employees Stock Option Plan, 1993 Stock Incentive Program and stock options granted pursuant to Dan Carmichaels employment agreement and any applicable agreements under the foregoing (together, the " _Company Incentive Plans_ ") that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be converted into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than five Business Days after the Effective Time), a cash payment equal to the product of ( _i_ ) the excess, if any, of ( _A_ ) the Merger Consideration over ( _B_ ) the per share exercise price of such Company Option, multiplied by ( _ii_ ) the number of shares covered by such Company Option, less ( _iii_ ) any required withholding taxes. Any stock appreciation rights granted in tandem with a Company Option shall be cancelled without payment. 

  

 (b) _Stock Appreciation Rights_. At the Effective Time, the right to receive shares of Company Common Stock or cash pursuant to the exercise of any freestanding stock appreciation rights (each, a " _Company SAR_ ") granted pursuant to the Company Incentive Plans or any agreement thereunder that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be converted into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than five Business Days after the Effective Time), a cash payment equal to the product of ( _i_ ) the 

   ##### 

  

    

excess, if any, of ( _A_ ) the Merger Consideration, over ( _B_ ) the per
share exercise price of such Company SAR, multiplied by ( _ii_ ) the number
of shares covered by such Company SAR, less ( _iii_ ) any required
withholding taxes. 

  

 (c) _Company Restricted Shares_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall waive any vesting conditions applicable to any shares of restricted stock (each, a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") granted pursuant to the Company Incentive Plans, and such Company Restricted Shares shall be treated the same as other Shares for purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 (d) _Director Units_. At the Effective Time, the right to receive cash in respect of director performance shares granted pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Directors Deferred Compensation Plan (each, a " _Director Unit_ ") that ( _i_ ) are outstanding, and ( _ii_ ) have not been converted into cash as of the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than five Business Days after the Effective Time), a cash payment equal to the Merger Consideration for each Share to which such Director Unit relates, less any required withholding taxes. 

  

 (e) _Performance-Based Awards_. At the Effective Time, the right to receive shares of Company Common Stock or cash in respect of outstanding Performance-Based Awards under the Company Incentive Plans (each, a " _Performance-Based Award_ "), whether or not vested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Performance-Based Award to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than five Business Days after the Effective Time), a cash payment equal to ( _i_ ) the number of shares issuable pursuant to the Performance-Based Award calculated at the higher of the "target level" and the award level actually met as of the Effective Time as determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors prior to the Effective Time in good faith in accordance with the terms of the Company Incentive Plans and the Performance-Based Award, multiplied by ( _ii_ ) the per share Merger Consideration, multiplied by ( _iii_ ) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of whole calendar months between the beginning of the performance period (as defined under the respective Company Incentive Plan or award agreement under which the award was granted, as appropriate) and the Effective Time, and the denominator of which is the whole number of calendar months in such performance period, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. The Company shall provide Parent the compensation committees determination of the award level actually met at least three Business Days prior to the Closing. 

  

 (f) _Automatic Cancellation_. As of the Effective Time, all Company Options (including any stock appreciation rights granted in tandem with such Company Options), Company SARs, Company Restricted Shares, Director Units, Performance-Based Awards and other equity-based awards granted by the Company (together, " _Company Equity Awards_ ") shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and 

   ##### 

  

    

retired and shall expire and cease to exist, and each holder of such a Company
Equity Award shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
rights specified in this Section 1.9. The consideration pursuant to this
Section 1.9 (the " _Equity Award Consideration_ ") shall be paid to each
holder of a Company Equity Award in accordance with Article II. 

  

 (g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions and take or cause to be taken prior to the Effective Time all such other action as may reasonably be required to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 1.9. 

  

 Section 1.10. _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company Common Stock is changed into a different number of shares or different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other securities is declared with a record date within such period, or any similar event occurs, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Shares or Company Equity Awards the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

  

 Section 1.11. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (other than the other provisions of this Section 1.11) and to the extent available under the OGCL, no shares of Company Common Stock held by a Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") shall be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Any such shareholder shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the fair cash value of such Dissenting Shareholders Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 1701.85 of the OGCL;  _provided_ , _however_ , that all Dissenting Shares held by any Dissenting Shareholder who shall have failed to perfect or who otherwise shall have withdrawn, in accordance with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, or lost such Dissenting Shareholders rights to appraisal of such shares under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares in the manner provided in Article II. The Company shall give Parent ( _a_ ) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to shareholders rights of appraisal and ( _b_ ) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the OGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares or settle any such demands. 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE II 

  

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND COMPANY EQUITY AWARDS

    

 Section 2.1. _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration and the Company Equity Awards for the Equity Award Consideration (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of Shares and the Company Equity Awards an amount of cash representing the aggregate cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.8 and Section 1.9. Any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". 

  

 Section 2.2. _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event, within three Business Days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail ( _x_ ) to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time ( _i_ ) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 2.7) to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree and ( _ii_ ) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates as provided in Section 2.7) in exchange for the Merger Consideration and ( _y_ ) to each holder of a Company Equity Award, a check in an amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.9 hereof in respect of such Equity Award. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.7) to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate (or provider of an affidavit as provided in Section 2.7) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates as provided in Section 2.7). No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check in the proper amount of any cash consideration pursuant to Section 1.8 may be issued with respect to such Shares to such a transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.3. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with the terms of Article I and this Article II shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.7). 

  

 Section 2.4. _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation (or otherwise on the instruction of Parent), and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares five years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 Section 2.5. _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any of their respective Affiliates or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official or Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 Section 2.6. _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively or a combination of the foregoing or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.8 and Section 1.9, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from any such investments shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the aggregate cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.8 and Section 1.9 shall be promptly returned to Parent upon request. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.7. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby. 

  

 Section 2.8. _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Company Restricted Shares) or Company Equity Awards or any other equity rights in the Company such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. 

  

 Section 2.9. _Share Transfer Books_. The share transfer books of the Company shall be closed at the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, any Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

 Section 6.3. _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall immediately cease, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and each of their respective Representatives to, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to a Takeover Proposal. Except as permitted by this Section 6.3, after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company and its directors and officers shall not, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and each Company Subsidiarys Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, ( _i_ ) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiry with respect to, or the making of, any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, ( _ii_ ) participate in any negotiations regarding a Takeover Proposal with, or furnish any nonpublic information relating to a Takeover Proposal to, any Person that has made or, to the knowledge of the Company, is considering making a Takeover Proposal, or ( _iii_ ) engage in discussions regarding a Takeover Proposal with any Person that has made, or, to the knowledge of the Company, is considering making, a Takeover Proposal, except to notify such Person of the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.3. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding Section 6.3(a), prior to the time, but not after, the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, if the Company receives a written and unsolicited Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably believes to be credible, which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel) is or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company may take the following actions: ( _1_ ) furnish nonpublic information to the Person making such 

   ##### 

  

    

Takeover Proposal, but only if ( _A_ ) prior to so furnishing such
information, the Company has entered into a Qualifying Confidentiality
Agreement with such Person, and ( _B_ ) all such information has previously
been provided to Parent and Merger Sub or is provided to Parent and Merger
Sub prior to or contemporaneously with the time it is provided to the Person
making such Takeover Proposal or such Persons Representatives, and ( _2_ )

with respect to the Takeover Proposal. The Company promptly (and in any event
within 48 hours) shall advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of
( _i_ ) any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Takeover Proposal and the material terms of such proposal (including the
identity of the party making such proposal and, if applicable, copies of any
documents or correspondence evidencing such proposal), and ( _ii_ ) any
request for non-public information relating to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary other than requests for information not reasonably expected to be

Takeover Proposal (including any material change to the terms thereof). 

  

 (c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not ( _i_ ) withhold, withdraw or modify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, ( _ii_ ) approve or recommend (or publicly propose to approve or recommend ) any Takeover Proposal or ( _iii_ ) take any action to render the Rights Agreement inapplicable to a Third Party, (it being understood that the Board of Directors may take no position with respect to a Takeover Proposal that takes the form of a tender offer until the close of business as of the tenth Business Day after the commencement of such tender offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act without such action being considered an adverse modification) (any of the foregoing, a " _Change in the Company Recommendation_ "). The Company shall not, and the Board of Directors shall not allow the Company to, and the Company shall not allow any Company Subsidiary to, in each case except as permitted by Section 8.1 hereof, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (except for Qualifying Confidentiality Agreements permitted under Section 6.3(b)) relating to any Takeover Proposal.

   ##### 

  

    

written notice to Parent at least three Business Days in advance (the "
_Notice Period_ ") of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
specify all material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and copies
of any documents or correspondence evidencing such Superior Proposal), and any
material modifications to any of the foregoing, ( _3_ ) during the Notice
Period the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and outside
counsel to, negotiate with Parent in good faith should Parent propose to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute (in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors) a Superior Proposal and ( _4_ ) such Takeover Proposal
continues to constitute (in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors) a Superior Proposal after taking into account any such amendments
that Parent shall have agreed to make prior to the end of the Notice Period. 

  

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company from ( _i_ ) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state law with regard to a Takeover Proposal, including Rule 14a-9, 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, ( _ii_ ) making any disclosure to the Companys shareholders if, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the Company determines that such disclosure would be required under applicable Law or ( _iii_ ) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 6.3.

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means any Takeover Proposal (with the percentages set forth in such definition changed from 20% to 50%) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, ( _x_ ) would result in a transaction that if consummated, would be more favorable to the shareholders of the Company than the Merger, taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement), and ( _y_ ) is reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms so proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

applicable Company Subsidiary to such employees immediately before the date

program), and ( _D_ ) with respect to Parents or its Affiliates pre-age 65
and post-age 65 retiree health programs, employees of the Company and the

assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.10.

 (iv) Section 8.1(b)(iii) if ( _A_ ) after the date of this Agreement any Person or "group" (within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) publicly makes or publicly announces an intention to make a Takeover Proposal prior to the Company obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and such Takeover Proposal or publicly announced intention shall not have been publicly withdrawn without qualification at least five (5) Business Days prior to the vote of the shareholders with respect to the Merger, and ( _B_ ) this Agreement is terminated thereafter by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii).

 (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this 

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not

 Section 9.4. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, including by facsimile, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto has received counterparts thereof signed and delivered (by telecopy or otherwise) by all of the other parties hereto. 

  

 Section 9.5. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. 

  

 (a) This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules) constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE BY, OR MADE AVAILABLE BY, ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING. 

  

 (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and, except as provided in Section 6.10, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person not a party to this Agreement any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever; except that the Company shall have the right to recover, solely through an action brought by the Company, damages from Parent in the event of a willful or intentional breach of this Agreement by Parent, in which event the damages recoverable by the Company for itself

the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 6.10 shall not arise
unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties
in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto
and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with Section 9.9 without notice or liability to any other Person.
In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date. 

  

 Section 9.6. _Severability_.
