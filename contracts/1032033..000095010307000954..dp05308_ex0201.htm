 ARTICLE 2 
 THE MERGER

 

  Section 2.01 _. The Merger._ (a) At the Effective Time (as herein
defined), Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company
in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger
Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation"). 

 

  (b) As soon as practicable (and in no event later than three Business
Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all
conditions to the Merger, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other
filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the foregoing would occur on a date prior
to the end of the Marketing Period (as herein defined), such actions shall
instead occur on the earliest to occur of (i) a date during the Marketing
Period specified by Parent on no less than three (3) Business Days notice to
the Company and (ii) the final day of the Marketing Period (subject in each
case to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all
conditions set forth in Article 9). The Merger shall become effective at such
time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with
the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be specified in
the certificate of merger).

 

  (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

 

  Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time:

 

  (a) except (i) as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b) or (ii) for
Dissenting Shares (as herein defined), each share of Company Stock outstanding

 

 8    
  
 

 immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive $60.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration");

 

  (b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock
(other than shares in an Employee Plan of the Company) or owned by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled,
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

 

  (c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights,
powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

  Section 2.03 _. Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as the exchange agent in the Merger (the "Exchange
Agent"). Prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent cash in an amount equal to the aggregate amounts payable under
Section 2.02(a) and Section 2.04. The funds so deposited with the Exchange
Agent shall be held by the Exchange Agent and applied by it in accordance with
this Section 2.03 and Section 2.04 for the purpose of exchanging for the
Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company Stock
(the "Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock
(the "Uncertificated Shares"). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of
shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent)
for use in such exchange.

 

  (b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an
"agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect
of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share.
Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate
or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

 

  (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper

 

 9    
  
 

 form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred
and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent
any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has
been paid or is not payable.

 

  (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article
2.

 

  (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company Stock six months after the Effective Time shall
be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any
amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

 

  Section 2.04 _. Stock Options; Restricted Stock Units; Restricted Stock
and Equivalents._ Except as may otherwise be agreed between Parent and a
holder of a Company Stock Option (as herein defined), Restricted Stock Unit
(as herein defined), Restricted Stock (as herein defined) or Deferred Stock
Units (as herein defined):

 

  (a) As of the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Company
Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") that then remains outstanding and
originally was granted under any Company Stock Plan (other than the ESPP,
which shall be governed by Section 2.04(e) below), whether or not then vested
or exercisable, automatically shall be terminated at the Effective Time
and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive thereupon in
full satisfaction of such Company Stock Option as of the Effective Time, an
amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the
product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price of such Company Stock Option and (y) the number of
shares of Company Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option.

 

  (b) As of the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding restricted
stock unit or similar equity-based awards (whether vested or unvested) granted
under any Company Stock Plan (the "Restricted Stock Units") shall be
terminated and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(subject to applicable withholding taxes) payable with respect to the number
of shares of Company Stock represented by such unit or similar equity-based
award. As of the Effective Time, all amounts held in participant accounts
under the

 

 10    
  
 

 Deferred Compensation Plans that are denominated in Company Stock shall be
converted into an obligation to pay cash with a value equal to the product of
(i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of shares of Company
Stock deemed held in such participant accounts ("Deferred Stock Units"). Such
obligation shall be payable or distributable in accordance with the terms of
the Deferred Compensation Plans (as amended to comply with Section 409A of
the Code) and, prior to the time of any distribution, such deferred amounts
shall be permitted to be deemed invested in another investment option under
the applicable Plan.

 

  (c) As of the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of
restricted stock (whether vested or unvested) granted under any Company Stock
Plan (the "Restricted Stock") shall be terminated and converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (subject to applicable withholding
taxes) payable with respect to the number of shares of Company Stock
represented by such share of Restricted Stock.

 

  (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents of Third Parties and make all
amendments, if any, to the terms of the Company Stock Plans and each
outstanding award agreement issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, as
applicable, and shall take all other actions within the control of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, that are necessary to give effect to the
foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04. Parent shall direct the Surviving
Corporation to make the payments required under this Section 2.04 as promptly
as practicable following the Effective Time.

 

  (e) The Company shall take all action as is necessary to cause the
Companys Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") to be
suspended effective as of a date not later than the end of the calendar month
of the date of this Agreement, such that the current "offering period" will
end on April 30, 2007 and will be the final offering period under the ESPP,
and, as of the Effective Time and subject to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall terminate the
ESPP.

 

  Section 2.05 _. Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, but excluding any change that results from any exercise
of options outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase shares of Company
Stock granted under the Companys stock option or compensation plans or
arrangements, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

 

  Section 2.06 _. Withholding Rights._ Each of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the

 

 11    
  
 

 consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign
tax law. If the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, so deducts and withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Company Stock in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 

  Section 2.07 _. Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this Article 2.

 

  Section 2.08 _. Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, if required by Delaware Law (but only to the
extent required thereby), shares of Company Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Company Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.02(b)) and that are held by
holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have
complied with, Section 262 of Delaware Law (the "Dissenting Shares") will not
be convertible into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders
of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such
Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under Delaware Law. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for,
at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for
payment of the Merger Consideration for such shares. At the Effective Time,
any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of Delaware Law and as
provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent (i) notice of
any demands received by the Company for appraisals and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such notices and demands. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or settle any such demands.

 

 12    
  
 

  Section 2.09 _. Preferred Stock._ Each share of Series A Preferred
Stock and Series B Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall have the
rights and privileges as set forth in the Surviving Corporations certificate
of incorporation.

 

 ARTICLE 3 
 THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

 

  Section 3.01 _. Certificate of Incorporation._ The certificate of
incorporation of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with Applicable Law.

 

  Section 3.02 _. Bylaws._ The bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect at
the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with Applicable Law.

 

  Section 3.03 _. Directors and Officers._ From and after the Effective
Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified
in accordance with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and
(ii) the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 ARTICLE 4

Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 9, 2007 or the Companys
Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC since January 1, 2007 but
prior to the date hereof (excluding any risk factor disclosures contained in
such documents under the heading "Risk Factors" and any disclosure of risks
included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or other statements
that are similarly non-specific and are predictive or forward-looking in
nature) if the relevance of such disclosure as an exception to one or more of
the following representations and warranties is reasonably apparent, or (ii)
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Parent

  Section 4.01 _. Corporate Existence and Power._ The Company is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of which would
not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company

 

 13    
  
 

 is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except
for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not be
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

  Section 4.02 _. Corporate Authorization._ (a) The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys
corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the Companys
stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Stock is the only vote of the holders of any of the Companys capital
stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger (the
"Company Stockholder Approval"). This Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of the Company.

 

  (b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Companys Board of
Directors, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Transaction
Committee, has (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Companys
stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and (iii) resolved (subject to Section 6.03) to
recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement by its stockholders (such
recommendation, the "Company Board Recommendation"). Such determination,
approval and resolution is in effect and has not been rescinded or modified
as of the date hereof.

 

  Section 4.03 _. Governmental Authorization._ The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority other than (i) the
filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of
other states in which the Company is qualified to do business; (ii) compliance
with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act; (iii) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and any other applicable U.S. state
or federal securities laws; (iv) the approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the "FDIC") under the Change in Bank Control Act; (v) the
approval of the Utah Commissioner of Financial Institutions ("Utah
Commissioner") under the Utah Financial Institutions Act; (vi) the approval of

and in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in

  Section 4.07 _. SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act._ (a) The
Company has delivered or made available (for purposes of this

registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy
statement filed with or furnished to the SEC by the Company pursuant to the
1933 Act or 1934 Act since January 1, 2006 and

 

16    
  
 

 prior to the date of this Agreement (the documents referred to in this
Section 4.07(a), collectively, the "Company SEC Documents").

 

  (b) As of its filing date, each Company SEC Document complied as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act
and the 1934 Act, as the case may be.

 

  (c) As of its filing date, each Company SEC Document filed pursuant to
the 1934 Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 

  (d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as
amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of
the date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading.

 

  (e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in
which the periodic reports required under the 1934 Act are being prepared.
Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the
Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer to
material information required to be included in the Companys periodic
reports required under the 1934 Act.

 

  (f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained a
system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15
under the 1934 Act) ("internal controls"). Such internal controls are
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the
Companys financial reporting and the preparation of Company
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The
Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal
controls prior to the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and audit
committee (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in internal
controls. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of any such
disclosure made by management to the Companys auditors and audit committee
since December 31, 2005.

 

  (g) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined
in

 

 17    
  
 

 Rule 3b-7 under the 1934 Act) or director of the Company other than those
made in the ordinary course of the Companys business and on substantially the
same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with
persons not related to the Company. The Company has not, since the enactment
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, taken any action prohibited by Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

  Section 4.08 _. Financial Statements._ The audited consolidated
financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements

its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated
results of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the
periods then ended (subject to normal year-end adjustments in amounts
consistent with past experience and the absence of footnotes in the case of
any unaudited interim financial statements). The books and records of the

material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions.

Company to be filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger (the "Company

the 1934 Act. __At the time the Company Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto is first mailed to stockholders of the Company, and at the
time such stockholders vote on adoption of this Agreement and at the
Effective Time, the Company Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended, if
applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The representations and warranties contained in this Section
4.09 will not apply to statements or omissions included in the Company Proxy
Statement based upon information furnished to the Company by Parent

next sentence, there is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding pending

affecting, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator, that would be reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date
hereof, there is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding pending against,

be reasonably expected to materially impair the ability of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  Section 5.04 _. Non-Contravention._ The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and
the consummation by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions

and at the Effective Time, will contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

with the terms of this Agreement, each of the Equity Commitment Letters is in
full force and effect, is a valid and binding obligation of each of the
parties thereto and has not been amended or modified in any respect (and any
amendment or replacement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement will
be, when entered into, in full force and effect and a valid and binding
obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties

with the terms of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and is a valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the

of Parent, the other parties thereto). The commitments set forth in the

its Subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith based upon reasonable
assumptions, immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including payment of the aggregate consideration payable
pursuant to Article 2, the receipt of the Financing by Parent, payment of all
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and payment of all related fees and

of the Company (acting through the Transaction Committee if such committee

counsel, the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Transaction
Committee if such committee still exists) determines in good faith that the

respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and (B) enter into, participate, facilitate and maintain
discussions or negotiations with, and otherwise cooperate with or assist, the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal;

in discussions concerning an Acquisition Proposal from a Person or group of
related Persons pursuant to this Section 6.03(c) .

 

  (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company

 

 34

concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to
all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause
(B) below, the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the
Transaction Committee, if such committee still exists) may (i) effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if the
Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Transaction Committee,
if such committee still exists) determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company
shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii), and
any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii) shall be void
and of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such termination the
Company pays the Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 11.05(a); and
_provided further_ , that the Board of Directors may not effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii) unless: (A) the Company
shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger Subsidiary, at
least four Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period"), of its intention to

Superior Proposal), if applicable, and shall have contemporaneously provided a
copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making
such Superior Proposal and other material documents; and (B) prior to
effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement
to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal,
the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to,
during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and Merger Subsidiary in good
faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Subsidiary desire to negotiate) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit
the Board of Directors (acting through the Transaction Committee, if such
committee still exists) not to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or to
conclude that such Acquisition Proposal has ceased to constitute a Superior
Proposal, as the case may be. In the event of any material revisions to the
Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and Merger Subsidiary and to comply with the requirements of
this Section 6.03(d) with respect to such new written notice, except that the
Notice Period shall be reduced to one Business Day.

 

  (e) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 6.03 by any of the Company Representatives shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.03 by the Company.

Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees that, from the date of this Agreement
to the Effective Time, it shall not take any action or fail to take any
action required hereunder that is intended to, or would reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially
impede the ability of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  Section 7.02 _. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary._ Parent shall take
all action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

  Section 7.03 _. Voting of Shares._ Parent shall vote all shares of
Company Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of
adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 

  Section 7.04 _. Director and Officer Liability._ Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

 

  (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable
Law (and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law), each present and former
director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an
"Indemnified Person") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or related to such Indemnified Persons service as a director
or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such
Persons at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, including the approval of this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising out of
or related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent
and the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and any Indemnified Person, on
the other hand, shall cooperate with respect to any actual or threatened
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and none of them shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation with respect to any such Indemnified Person
without the prior consent of the other (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld), except that Parent or the Company may settle or compromise any
action that (i) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person
(which release shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Person) from all

 

 37    
  
 

 liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
claim and (ii) does not include an admission of fault of such Indemnified
Person.

 

  (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company
is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension
of (i) the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policies and (ii) the Companys
existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or
prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with a comparable
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, "DandO Insurance") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits
of liability that are no less advantageous in the aggregate than the coverage
provided under the Companys existing policies with respect to any actual or
alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect,
breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such
capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, then the obligations under the preceding sentence shall be fully
satisfied if the Surviving Corporation continues, and the Surviving
Corporation shall continue, to maintain in effect for a period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of
the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are no less advantageous in the aggregate than the coverage provided
under the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least
as favorable in the aggregate as provided in the Companys existing policies
as of the date hereof; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to
this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided,
further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

  (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.04.

 

 38    
  
 

  (d) This Section 7.04 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and personal representatives
and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its successors and
assigns. If any Indemnified Person makes any claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Section 7.04 that is denied by
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, and a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that the Indemnified Person is entitled to such indemnification,
then the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall pay such Indemnified Persons
reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses,
incurred in connection with pursuing such claim against the Surviving
Corporation or Parent.

 

  (e) The rights of the Indemnified Persons under this Section 7.04 shall
be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Persons may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any
agreement or contract of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor
of any Indemnified Person as provided in the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company or any
indemnification contract or agreement between such Indemnified Person and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Effective Time and shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Person.

 

 ARTICLE 8 
 COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

 

  The parties hereto agree that: 
  
  Section 8.01 _. Reasonable Best Efforts._

 

  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company
and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things proper or
advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable
with any Governmental Authority or other third party all documentation
to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents;
(ii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations,
permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from
any Governmental Authority or other third party that are proper or advisable
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii)
cooperating with the other in connection with the preparation

 

39    
  
 

 and filing of any such filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents
(including, with respect to the party hereto making a filing, providing copies
of all such documents that may be disclosed to third parties under Applicable
Law to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if
requested, to accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
in connection therewith) and in connection with obtaining any requisite
approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations by or from any third party or Governmental Authority. If any
objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any Applicable Law or if any action, suit or other proceeding
is instituted or threatened by any Governmental Authority or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any
Applicable Law, Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts promptly to resolve such objections. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall agree to hold separate or to divest
any of the businesses or properties or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and the Affiliates of Parent agree to restructure the equity
ownership of Parent and the related governance rights with respect to Parent
or the Company and its Subsidiaries to obtain HSR Act clearance (the
"Specified Actions"), if and as may be required (i) by the applicable
Governmental Authority in order to resolve such objections as such
Governmental Authority may have to such transactions under any Applicable Law
(it being understood and agreed that the foregoing shall include the prompt
divestiture, liquidation, sale or other disposition of, or other appropriate
action (including the placing in a trust or otherwise holding separate) with
respect to Company Bank, if Parent has been unable to obtain the requisite
regulatory approvals relating to Company Bank in a reasonably timely manner
customary for other transactions of a similar nature), or (ii) by any
domestic or foreign court or other tribunal, in any action, suit or other
proceeding brought by a private party or Governmental Authority challenging
such transactions as violative of any Applicable Law, in order to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution, vacating, lifting, altering or
reversal of, any order that has the effect of restricting, preventing or
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with obtaining the
foregoing approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and
other confirmations and in taking actions to resolve any such objections, (i)
Parent shall not be required to take actions that would be reasonably likely
to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
and (ii) other than the Specified Actions, the Affiliates of Parent (other
than, after the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall not be
required to take any actions, be subject to any conditions or enter into any
agreements or commitments with respect to their respective businesses or the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

  (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing and subject
to Applicable Law, each of Parent and the Company shall keep the other
apprised of

 

 40    
  
 

 the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications between Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and any third
party and/or any Governmental Authority with respect to such transactions.
Subject to Applicable Law, and except as prohibited by the applicable
Governmental Authority, no party hereto shall independently participate in
any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with such Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby without giving
the other party hereto prior notice of the meeting and the opportunity to
attend and/or participate. The parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with
one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted to
any Governmental Authority by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing and
not in limitation, each of Parent and the Company shall make an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby promptly and supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and take all other reasonable actions
consistent with Section 8.01(a) necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable.

 

  Section 8.02 _. Certain Filings._ (a) The Company and Parent shall
cooperate with one another (i) in connection with the preparation of
the Company Proxy Statement, (ii) in determining whether any action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any
actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from
parties to any material contracts, in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) in taking such actions
or making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection
therewith or with the Company Proxy Statement and seeking timely to obtain
any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

 

  (b) Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Company Proxy Statement, in each case each time
before either such document (or any amendment thereto) is filed with the SEC,
and Company shall incorporate the reasonable comments of Parent and its
counsel in the Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall (i) promptly provide
Parent and its counsel with any comments or other communications,
whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from
time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Company Proxy
Statement promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and
(ii) permit Parent and its counsel to participate in the response to those
comments, including by participating in any discussions or meetings with the
SEC, and shall incorporate the reasonable comments of Parent and its counsel
in that response.

 

 41    
  
 

  Section 8.03 _. Public Announcements._ Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release, making any
other public statement (which shall be deemed to include any widely
disseminated or general communication to the Companys non-executive
employees) or scheduling any press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any
listing agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or
association, shall not issue any such press release, make any such
other public statement or schedule any such press conference or conference
call before such consultation.

 

  Section 8.04 _. Further Assurances._ At and after the Effective Time,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized
to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise
in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger.

 

  Section 8.05 _. Access to Information._ From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the
Confidentiality Agreements, the Company shall (i) give to Parent, its
counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives
reasonable access to the offices, employees, properties, books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to Parent, its counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such
financial and operating data and other information as such Persons may
reasonably request and (iii) instruct its employees, counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives to
cooperate with Parent in its investigation. Any investigation pursuant to this
Section shall be conducted during normal business hours and in such manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the other
party. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to
this Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by any party hereunder.

 

  Section 8.06 _. Notices of Certain Events._ Each of the Company and
Parent shall promptly notify the other of:

 

  (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to
the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied;

 

  (b) any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in
any

 

 42    
  
 

 condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied;

 

  (c) any notice or other communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or from any person alleging that the consent of such
person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent; and

 

  (d) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced
or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby;

 

  _provided, however,_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 8.06 shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any
other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving that notice. The Company
shall notify Parent, on a reasonably current basis, subject to Applicable Law,
of any events or changes with respect to any regulatory investigation
or action involving the Company or any of its Affiliates, and shall
reasonably cooperate with Parent or its Affiliates in efforts to mitigate any
adverse consequences to Parent or its Affiliates which may arise (including by
coordinating and providing assistance in meeting with regulators).

 

  Section 8.07 _. Confidentiality._ Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall
hold, and shall cause their counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives to hold, in strict confidence all nonpublic
documents and confidential information furnished to Parent, Merger Subsidiary
or any of such counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreements.

 

  Section 8.08 _. Employee Matters._ (a) For a period of 12 months
following the Closing Date, each of the Company and Parent agree to
provide, or cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to provide, to
each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries base salary and annual
bonus opportunities not less than, and benefits that in the aggregate are
substantially similar to, the base salary and annual bonus opportunities and
benefits provided to each such employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time (excluding, for all purposes, equity-based compensation); _provided_ that
no provision of this Section 8.08(a) shall give any employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries any right to continued employment or impair in any way
the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate
the employment of any employee.

 

 43    
  
 

  (b) Each of the Company and Parent shall give, or cause the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries to give, all current and former employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries full credit for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and benefit accrual (but not including accrual of benefits under any
defined benefit pension plan), under the employee benefit plans and
arrangements maintained by Parent or the Company, its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates in which such employees participate after the Effective Time,
for such employees service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
respective Affiliates or predecessors prior to such date, except as would
result in a duplication of benefits.

 

  (c) With respect to all welfare benefit plans maintained by Parent or
the Company or its Subsidiaries for the benefit of employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries on and after the Effective Time, each of the Company
and Parent shall, or shall cause the Companys Subsidiaries to (i) cause there
to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition
limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum
out-of-pocket limitations, to amounts paid by such employees with respect to
similar plans maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time.

 

  (d) No provision of this Section 8.08 shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any employee or former employees of the Company
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) or in any other Person nor
shall any such provision constitute an amendment of any compensation and/or
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

 

  Section 8.09 _. Financing._

 

  (a) Parent shall, subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity
Commitment Letters, complete the Equity Financing as part of the consummation
of the Merger and shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter
( _provided_ that Parent and Merger Subsidiary may (i) amend the Debt
Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as
of the date of this Agreement, (ii) otherwise replace or amend the Debt
Commitment Letter so long as such action would not reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the Merger and the terms are not materially less
beneficial to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, with respect to conditionality,
than those in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this
Agreement and (iii) engage in an equity syndication to include other investors
in Parent (the "Equity Syndication")), including using reasonable best efforts
to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained therein (including the flex provisions) or on other terms
reasonably acceptable to Parent and not in violation of this Section 8.09(a)
and (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to such
Financing in such definitive agreements. In the event that all conditions to
the availability of the Financing (other than, with respect to the Debt
Financing, the funding of the Equity Financing) have been

 

 44    
  
 

 satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders
and other Persons to fund the Debt Financing and Equity Financing required to
consummate the Merger on the Closing Date. In the event any portion of
the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, (i) Parent shall promptly notify
the Company and (ii) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms not
materially less beneficial to Parent and Merger Subsidiary (as determined in
the reasonable judgment of Parent), in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as possible. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event that (i) all or any portion of the high yield
notes issuance described in the Debt Commitment Letter (the "High-Yield
Financing") has not been consummated, (ii) all closing conditions contained in
Article 9 (other than those contained in Section 9.02(a)(iii) and Section
9.03(iii)) shall have been satisfied or waived, and (iii) the bridge
facilities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter are available on the
terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, then Parent
shall cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used in lieu of such
contemplated High-Yield Financing, or a portion thereof, as promptly as
practicable following the final day of the Marketing Period. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Marketing Period" shall mean the first period of 30
consecutive calendar days (i) during and at the end of which Parent shall have
(and its financing sources shall have access to), in all material respects,
the Required Information (as herein defined) and (ii) throughout and at the
end of which the conditions set forth in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 (other
than the receipt of the certificate referred to therein) shall be satisfied;
_provided_ that if all of the conditions set forth in the foregoing clauses
(i) and (ii) have been met, except that the condition set forth in Section
9.01(a) has not been met because the Company Stockholder Meeting has not yet
been held, then, unless a bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been made and
remains outstanding, the Marketing Period shall commence on the date that is
21 calendar days prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting;
_provided further_ that the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date
that is the date on which the High-Yield Financing and the Debt Financing
(other than any portion of the Debt Financing that constituted bridge
financing with respect to such High-Yield Financing) is consummated; 
_provided further_ that the Marketing Period must occur either entirely before
or entirely after the periods (i) from and including August 18, 2007 through
and including September 3, 2007 or (ii) from and including December 22, 2007
through and including January 1, 2008. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit Parent or Merger Subsidiary from entering into agreements
relating to the Financing or the operation of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or,
as of the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the
Equity Syndication (so long as such agreement or entering into such agreements
would not reasonably be expected to materially delay the consummation of the
Merger). For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Debt Commitment Letter"
shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with
respect to any 

 

 45    
  
 

 alternative financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt
Commitment remaining in effect at the time in question).

 

  (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, and
prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, and use reasonable best efforts to cause the Company
Representatives to, at Parents sole expense for any and all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses, provide to Parent and Merger Subsidiary
such cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary, proper or
advisable in connection with the Debt Financing (which term shall include,
solely for purposes of this Section 8.09(b), all of the facilities set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter), the High-Yield Financing or the Equity
Syndication ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in meetings, presentations, road
shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies; (ii)
assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations,
offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Debt
Financing, the High-Yield Financing or Equity Syndication, including execution
and delivery of customary representation letters in connection with bank
information memoranda (including with respect to the absence of material non-
public information in materials furnished to "public side" lenders);
_provided_ that any private placement memoranda or prospectuses in relation
to high yield debt securities or the Equity Syndication need not be issued by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided further_ that any such
memoranda or prospectuses shall contain disclosure and financial statements
with respect to the Company or the Surviving Corporation reflecting the
Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor; (iii) as
promptly as reasonably practical, furnishing Parent and its Debt Financing
sources with financial and other information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including financial
statements, pro forma financial information, financial data, audit reports and
other information of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act and of type and form customarily included
in a registration statement on Form S-1 (or any applicable successor form)
(other than Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X) under the Securities Act for a
public offering to consummate the offering(s) of debt securities contemplated
by the High-Yield Financing, assuming that such offering(s) were consummated
at the same time during the Companys fiscal year as such offering(s) of debt
securities will be made, or as otherwise reasonably required in connection
with the Debt Financing, the High-Yield Financing, the Equity Syndication and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise necessary in
order to assist in receiving customary "comfort" (including "negative
assurance" comfort) from independent accountants in connection with the High-
Yield Financing (all such information in this clause (iii), the "Required
Information"); (iv) using reasonable best efforts to obtain customary
accountants comfort letters, legal opinions, appraisals,

 

 46    
  
 

 surveys, title insurance and other documentation and items relating to the
Debt Financing and the High-Yield Financing as reasonably requested by Parent
and, if requested by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, to cooperate with
and assist Parent or Merger Subsidiary in obtaining such documentation and
items; (v) using its reasonable best efforts to provide monthly financial
statements (excluding footnotes) within 25 days of the end of each month prior
to the Closing Date; (vi) executing and delivering, as of the Effective Time,
any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or
other certificates, legal opinions or documents, as may be reasonably
requested by Parent (including a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer
of the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters and consents
of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt
Financing and Equity Syndication) and otherwise reasonably facilitating the
pledging of collateral (including cooperation in connection with the pay-off
of existing indebtedness and the release of related Liens); (vii) taking
commercially reasonable actions necessary to (A) permit the prospective
lenders involved in the Debt Financing to evaluate the Companys and its
Subsidiaries current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies
and procedures relating thereto for the purposes of establishing collateral
arrangements as of the Effective Time and (B) establish, effective as of the
Effective Time, bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and
lock box arrangements in connection with the Debt Financing; (viii) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers, consents, estoppels and approvals
from other parties to material leases, encumbrances and contracts to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and to arrange discussions among
Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their financing sources with other parties to
material leases, encumbrances and contracts as of the Effective Time; and (ix)
taking all corporate actions, subject to the Effective Time, reasonably
requested by Parent that are necessary or customary to permit
the consummation of the Debt Financing, the High-Yield Financing and/or the
Equity Syndication and to permit the proceeds thereof, together with the cash
at the Company and its Subsidiaries (not needed for other purposes), to be
made available to Parent on the Closing Date to consummate the Merger; it
being understood that the Company shall have satisfied each of its obligations
set forth in clauses (i) through (ix) of this sentence if the Company shall
have used its reasonable best efforts to comply with such obligations whether
or not any applicable deliverables are actually obtained or provided (
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Marketing Period shall not
be considered to have commenced or expired, or the condition set forth in
Section 9.02(a)(i) satisfied, unless during and at the end of the Marketing
Period Parent shall have (and its financing sources shall have access to), in
all material respects, the Required Information). The Company will take
reasonable best efforts to periodically update any such Required Information
provided to Parent pursuant to clause (iii) of the foregoing sentence as may
be necessary such that such Required Information does not contain any untrue
statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements contained therein not misleading. The Company
hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection
with the Debt Financing and the High-

 

 47

terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(iii) or (z) either party

Company a termination fee of $900,000,000 in cash (the "Parent Termination
Fee"), it being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay
the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The Parent Termination
Fee shall be payable within two Business Days following any such termination.

negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
