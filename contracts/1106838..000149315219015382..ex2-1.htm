AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of October 10,
2019, is entered into by and among CHANTICLEER HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Public Company"); BIOSUB INC., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Public Company (the "Merger Sub"); and SONNET
BIOTHERAPEUTICS, INC., a New Jersey corporation ("Merger Partner," and
together with Public Company and the Merger Sub, the "Parties").

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Public Company (the "Public Company
Board") and the Board of Directors of Merger Partner (the "Merger Partner
Board") have each (i) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best
interests of, their respective corporations and stockholders, (ii) approved
this Agreement, the Merger and the actions contemplated by this Agreement and
(iii) determined to recommend that the stockholders of their respective
corporations vote, in the case of Merger Partner, to adopt this Agreement and
thereby approve the Merger and such other actions as are contemplated by this
Agreement and, in the case of Public Company, to approve the issuance of
shares of Public Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and to
approve such other actions as set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, the combination of Public Company and Merger Partner shall be
effected through a merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub into Merger Partner in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and the New Jersey Business Corporation
Act (the "BCA"), as a result of which Merger Partner will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Public Company;

  



  

WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");

  



  

WHEREAS, it is the Parties' express intent that, except as set forth herein,
neither Merger Partner nor Public Company shall be restricted in its capital-
raising and financing activities from and after the date hereof and through
the Closing Date, and shall raise funds by issuance and private placement of
such equity securities, and in such amounts and at such times, as their
respective boards of directors may deem appropriate and desirable; and

  



  

WHEREAS, in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, Public Company and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Public Company to be formed after the date hereof (the
"Spin-Off Entity") intend to engage in a transaction or series of
transactions involving the divestiture, assignment and other disposition of
all assets and liabilities of Public Company and/or its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, including without limitation the disposition of all of the
assets and liabilities of Public Company's business of owning, operating and
franchising fast casual dining concepts domestically and internationally,
which transaction or series of transactions shall be consummated prior the
closing of the Merger contemplated by this Agreement (such transaction or
series of transactions, and all of the undertakings of Public Company, Merger
Sub, and all of their respective Subsidiaries for the purpose thereof and
otherwise ancillary thereto, the "Disposition").

Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares of Merger Partner Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of Public Company
Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Public Company Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor and any amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d)

two decimal places) determined by dividing (i) the Merger Partner Valuation
by (ii) the Aggregate Valuation.

  



  

(iii) "Merger Partner Merger Shares" means the product determined by
multiplying (i) the Post-Closing Public Company Shares by (ii) the Merger
Partner Allocation Percentage.

  



  

(iv) "Merger Partner Outstanding Shares" means, subject to _Section 2.1(e)_ ,
the total number of shares of Merger Partner Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time expressed on a fully diluted and as-
converted-to-Merger Partner Common Stock basis, assuming, without limitation

Merger Partner Warrants outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) the issuance of shares of Public Company Common Stock in
respect of all other options, warrants or rights to receive such shares that
will be outstanding immediately after the Effective Time; _provided that_ ,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Merger Partner Outstanding Shares shall
include all Merger Partner Capital Stock after giving effect to the
consummation of all Pre-Closing Private Placement Transactions.

placement transactions, through the consummation of which either Public
Company or Merger Partner may raise capital through and until the Effective
Time, by the issuance or sale of Public Company capital stock or Merger
Partner Capital Stock, as the case may be, and/or the issuance or sale of any
other securities, debt instruments, derivatives or other rights of Public
Company or Merger Partner, as the case may be, including without limitation
through a facility or agreement with Global Emerging Markets North America,
Inc., and by issuance or sale of equity-linked securities and rights;
_provided that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, none of the transactions among
the Parties contemplated by this Agreement are, or shall be, Pre-Closing
Private Placement Transactions and; _provided further that_ , any
private placement transactions consummated by Public Company shall (a) only
be for equity securities of Public Company and (b) shall not exceed gross
proceeds of more than $3.0 million in the aggregate and for which Public
Company shall provide Merger Partner with notice of such private placement
transaction prior to its consummation, which notice shall include in
reasonable detail the terms of such financing and the parties to such
financing.

  



  

(ix) "Public Company Allocation Percentage" the quotient (rounded to two
decimal places) determined by (a) dividing (i) the Public Company Valuation
by (ii) the Aggregate Valuation and (b) reducing such amount by two percentage
points (2%) to account for the Spin-Off Entity Warrant.

  



  

(x) "Public Company Outstanding Shares" means, subject to _Section 2.1(e)_ ,

Effective Time.

  



  

(xii) "Spin-Off Entity Warrant" means a warrant to purchase a number of
shares of Public Company Common Stock equal to two percent (2%) of the number
of shares of Public Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
after the Merger (not taking into account any options, warrants or other
derivative securities of Public Company outstanding at such time),
which warrant (a) will be issued to the Spin-Off Entity by Public Company
following the Merger, (b) will have an exercise price of $0.01, will not be
exercisable for a period of 180 days from the Effective Time and will be
exercisable for a period of five (5) years from the Effective Time.

(d)  _Cancellation of Merger Partner Preferred Stock._ As of the Effective
Time, all issued and outstanding shares of Merger Partner Preferred Stock (if

Merger Partner Preferred Stock shall cease be authorized and to exist, and no
person shall have any rights with respect thereto.

  



  

(e)  _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. The Common Stock Exchange Ratio shall
be adjusted, as applicable and appropriate, to reflect fully the effect of
any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Public Company
Common Stock or Merger Partner Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization
or other like change with respect to Public Company Common Stock or Merger
Partner Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established)
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this
_Section 2.1(e)_ shall be construed to permit Public Company or Merger
Partner to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

2.2  _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
shares of Merger Partner Capital Stock for Public Company Stock pursuant to
the Merger are as follows:

  



  

(a)  _Exchange Agent_. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Public
Company shall deposit with Securities Transfer Corporation or another bank or

Partner (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Merger Partner Capital Stock, for exchange in accordance with this  _Section

entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_.

shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Public Company Common Stock
(plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Public Company Common
Stock and any dividends or distributions as provided below). Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by Public Company, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent and Public Company, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate
or book entry account representing that number of whole shares of Public
Company Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of this _ARTICLE II_ plus cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and any dividends or distributions then payable
pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_ , and the Certificate so surrendered shall
immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Merger
Partner Capital Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of
Merger Partner, a certificate representing the proper number of whole shares
of Public Company Common Stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and any dividends or distributions pursuant to
_Section 2.2(d)_ may be issued or paid to a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, only if such
Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2_ , each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive shares
of Public Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE II_
plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and any
dividends or distributions then payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_
as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_.

  



  

(c)  _No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Public Company Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of
Public Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of Merger Partner Capital Stock converted pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Public Company Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates delivered by such holder and the aggregate number of shares of
Merger Partner Capital Stock represented thereby) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest and subject to applicable Tax withholding) in
an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Public Company
Common Stock multiplied by the average of the last reported sales prices of
Public Company Common Stock at the 4:00 p.m., Eastern time, end of regular
trading hours on The Nasdaq Capital Market ("Nasdaq") during the five (5)
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day prior to the
Effective Time.

(d)  _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Public Company Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder of
record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
this  _Section 2.2_. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be issued and paid to the
record holder of the Certificate, at the time of such surrender the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
previously paid with respect to such whole shares of Public Company Common
Stock, without interest, and at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions having a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender that
are payable with respect to such whole shares of Public Company Common Stock.

  



  

(e)  _No Further Ownership Rights in Merger Partner Capital Stock_. All
shares of Public Company Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash or
dividends or other distributions paid pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ or
_2.2(d)_ ) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such shares of Merger Partner Capital Stock, and
from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Merger Partner Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE II_ ,
subject to applicable law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

  



  

(f)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Merger Partner Capital Stock for one
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Public Company, upon
demand, and any holder of Merger Partner Capital Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time who has not previously complied with this _Section 2.2_
shall thereafter look only to Public Company, as a general unsecured
creditor, for payment of its claim for Public Company Common Stock, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Public Company Common Stock and any dividends
or distributions with respect to Public Company Common Stock.

  



  

(g)  _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of
Public Company, Merger Sub, Merger Partner, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Merger Partner
Capital Stock or Public Company Common Stock, as the case may be, for such
shares or any cash amounts required to be delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on
which any shares of Public Company Common Stock, and any cash payable to the
holder of such Certificate or any dividends or distributions payable to the
holder of such Certificate pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_ would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, such
Certificate and any such shares of Public Company Common Stock or cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

(h)  _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Public Company and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares
of Merger Partner Capital Stock and any other recipient of payments hereunder
such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
other applicable provision of law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Surviving Corporation or Public Company, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Merger Partner Capital Stock
or other recipient of payments hereunder in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Public Company, as
the case may be.

  



  

(i)  _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the shares of Public Company Common Stock and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Public
Company Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

  



  

2.3  _Merger Partner Stock Plans and Merger Partner Warrants_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Merger Partner
Common Stock, if any (each, a "Merger Partner Stock Option" and collectively,
the "Merger Partner Stock Options"), all Merger Partner Warrants, if any, and
all Merger Partner Restricted Stock Units, if any, in each case whether vested
or unvested, shall be converted into the right to receive a number of shares
of Public Company Common Stock as if fully vested in accordance with their
terms, in the case of Merger Partner Restricted Stock Units; and in the case
of Merger Partner Stock Options and Merger Partner Warrants, as if fully
vested and exercised, for a number of shares of Public Company Common Stock as
is equal to the number of shares of Merger Partner Common Stock subject to
the unexercised portion of such Merger Partner Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by the Common Stock Exchange Ratio (rounded
down to the nearest whole share number), at an exercise price per share equal
to the exercise price per share of such Merger Partner Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Common Stock Exchange
Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). All stock option plans or other
stock or equity-related plans of Merger Partner (the "Merger Partner Stock
Plans") themselves, shall be terminated and no longer in force or effect as
of the time immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Public Company shall
deliver to the participants in Merger Partner Stock Plans appropriate notice
setting forth such participants' rights pursuant to Merger Partner Stock
Options and Merger Partner Restricted Stock Units, as provided in this
_Section 2.3_.

  



  

(c) Public Company shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Public Company Common Stock for
delivery upon redemption of Merger Partner Stock Options and Merger Partner
Restricted Stock Units in accordance with this _Section 2.3_.

2.4  _Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, "Dissenting Shares" shall mean shares of
Merger Partner Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held as of the Effective Time by a holder who has not
voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has made
a proper demand for appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section
14A:11-1 of the BCA (until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such holder's appraisal rights under the BCA with respect to
such shares, at which time such shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares).
Dissenting Shares will only entitle the holder thereof to such rights as are
granted by the BCA to a holder thereof and shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive Public Company Common Stock unless the
stockholder holding such Dissenting Shares shall have forfeited his, her or
its right to appraisal under the BCA or properly withdrawn his, her or its
demand for appraisal. If such stockholder has so forfeited or withdrawn his,
her or its right to appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then (i) as of the
occurrence of such event, such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease to be
Dissenting Shares and shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the
Effective Time, into and represent the right to receive Public Company Common
Stock issuable in respect of such Merger Partner Capital Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)_ or _Section 2.1(c)_ , as the case may be, without interest,
and (ii) promptly following the occurrence of such event, Public Company
shall deliver to the Exchange Agent a certificate representing Public Company
Common Stock to which such stockholder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.1(c)_ or _Section 2.1(c)_ as well as any cash or other distributions to
which such holder of Merger Partner Capital Stock may be entitled to under
this _ARTICLE II_ if not previously delivered to the Exchange Agent.

  



  

(b) Merger Partner shall give Public Company (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any Merger Partner Capital Stock, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments that relate to such demands received by
Merger Partner and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the BCA. Merger
Partner shall not, except with the prior written consent of Public Company
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or
where required by applicable law, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal of Merger Partner Capital Stock or settle or offer to settle
any such demands.

  



  

ARTICLE III

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MERGER PARTNER

  



  

Merger Partner represents and warrants to Public Company and Merger Sub that
the statements contained in this _ARTICLE III_ are true and correct, except
as set forth herein or in the disclosure schedule delivered and/or otherwise
made available by Merger Partner to Public Company and Merger Sub as of the
date of this Agreement (the "Merger Partner Disclosure Schedule"). For
purposes hereof, the phrase "to the knowledge of Merger Partner" and similar
expressions mean the actual knowledge of the persons identified on _Section
K_ of the Merger Partner Disclosure Schedule for this purpose, and such
knowledge as such persons would reasonably be expected to have obtained in
the course of their performance of their positions at Merger Partner (after
due inquiry).

3.1  _Organization, Standing and Power_. Merger Partner is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as currently conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and
is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction listed on
_Section 3.1_ of the Merger Partner Disclosure Schedule, which jurisdictions
constitute the only jurisdictions in which the character of the properties it
owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, that have not had, and are
not reasonably likely to have, a Merger Partner Material Adverse Effect. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Merger Partner Material Adverse Effect"
means any material adverse change, effect, event, circumstance or development
that is materially adverse to or has a material adverse effect on
the business, assets, liabilities, capitalization, financial condition, or
results of operations of Merger Partner and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; _provided, however_ , that none of the following, to the extent arising
after the date of this Agreement, either alone or in combination, shall be
deemed to be a Merger Partner Material Adverse Effect, and none of the
following shall be taken into account in determining whether there has been
or will be a Merger Partner Material Adverse Effect: any change or event
caused by or resulting from (A) the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, or the announcement or pendency thereof, (B)
changes in prevailing economic or market conditions in the United States or
any other jurisdiction in which such entity has substantial business
operations (except to the extent those changes have a disproportionate effect
on Merger Partner and its Subsidiaries relative to the other participants in
the industry or industries in which Merger Partner and its Subsidiaries
operate), (C) changes or events affecting the industry or industries in which
Merger Partner and its Subsidiaries operate generally or compete (except to
the extent those changes or events have a disproportionate effect on Merger
Partner and its Subsidiaries relative to the other participants in the
industry or industries in which Merger Partner and its Subsidiaries operate),
(D) changes in generally accepted accounting principles or requirements
(except to the extent those changes have a disproportionate effect on Merger
Partner and its Subsidiaries relative to the other participants in the
industry or industries in which Merger Partner and its Subsidiaries operate),
(E) changes in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability or
interpretations thereof by any Governmental Entity (except to the extent
those changes have a disproportionate effect on Merger Partner and its
Subsidiaries relative to the other participants in the industry or industries
in which Merger Partner and its Subsidiaries operate), (F) any natural
disaster or any outbreak of major hostilities in which the United States is
involved or any act of terrorism within the United States or directed against
its facilities or citizens wherever located or any governmental response to
any of the foregoing (except to the extent those changes or events have a
disproportionate effect on Merger Partner and its Subsidiaries relative
to the other participants in the industry or industries in which Merger
Partner and its Subsidiaries operate), or (G) any failure by Merger Partner
to meet any internal guidance, budgets, plans, projections or forecasts of its
revenues, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations
(but not, in the case of Clause (G)), the underlying cause of such changes or
failures, unless such changes or failures would otherwise be excepted from
this definition). For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the
terms "material," "materially" and "materiality" as used in this Agreement
with an initial lower-case "m" shall have their respective customary and
ordinary meanings, without regard to the meanings ascribed to Merger Partner
Material Adverse Effect or Public Company Material Adverse Effect, in each
case as defined in this Agreement. Merger Partner has made available to
Public Company complete and accurate copies of its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and is not in material default under or in material
violation of any provision of either such document.

for each Subsidiary of Merger Partner: (i) its name; (ii) the number and type

enterprise in which such party (or another Subsidiary of such party) owns or

or ownership interests of such entity or (B) the right to receive more than
50% of the net assets of such entity available for distribution to the
holders of outstanding stock or ownership interests upon a liquidation or
dissolution of such entity. For the avoidance of doubt, Merger Sub is a
Subsidiary of Public Company.

  



  

(b) Each Subsidiary of Merger Partner is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or formation (to the extent such concepts are applicable in
such jurisdiction), has all requisite corporate (or similar, in the case of a
non-corporate entity) power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted,
and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation (to the extent such concepts are applicable) in each jurisdiction
where the character of its properties owned, operated or leased or the nature
of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except for such failures
to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, that have not had, and are not reasonably likely to have, a
Merger Partner Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock and other equity securities or interests of each Subsidiary of
Merger Partner are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights and all such shares (other than directors'
qualifying shares in the case of non-U.S. Subsidiaries, all of which Merger
Partner has the power to cause to be transferred for no or nominal
consideration to Merger Partner or Merger Partner's designee) are owned, of
record and beneficially, by Merger Partner or another of its Subsidiaries free
and clear of all Liens, claims, agreements or limitations in Merger Partner's
voting rights. There are no outstanding or authorized options, warrants,
rights, agreements or commitments to which Merger Partner or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or which are binding on any of them providing for the
issuance, disposition or acquisition of any capital stock of any Subsidiary of
Merger Partner. There are no outstanding stock appreciation, phantom stock or
similar rights with respect to any Subsidiary of Merger Partner. There are no
voting trusts, proxies or other agreements or understandings with respect to
the voting of any capital stock of any Subsidiary of Merger Partner.

(c) Merger Partner has made available to Public Company complete and accurate
copies of the charter, bylaws or other organizational documents, each as
amended, of each Subsidiary of Merger Partner.

  



  

(d) Merger Partner does not control directly or indirectly or have any direct
or indirect equity participation or similar interest in any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other business
association or entity which is not a Subsidiary of Merger Partner. There are
no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of Merger Partner or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital
stock of any Subsidiary of Merger Partner or to provide funds to or make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any
Subsidiary of Merger Partner or any other entity, other than guarantees of
bank obligations of Subsidiaries of Merger Partner entered into in the
ordinary course of business consistent in all, with respect to Merger Partner
only, material respects with past practice (as applicable to a party, the
"Ordinary Course of Business").

  



  

3.4  _Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

  



  

(a) Merger Partner has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and, subject only to the adoption of this Agreement (the
"Merger Partner Voting Proposal") by Merger Partner's stockholders under the
BCA and Merger Partner's amended and restated certificate of incorporation
(the "Merger Partner Stockholder Approval"), to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Merger Partner Board has unanimously (as among all directors
in attendance) (i) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best
interests of, Merger Partner and its stockholders, (ii) approved this
Agreement, the Merger and the actions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions of the BCA, (iii) declared this Agreement
advisable, and (iv) determined to recommend that the stockholders of Merger
Partner vote to adopt this Agreement and thereby approve the Merger and such
other actions as contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by Merger Partner have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Merger Partner, subject only to the required
receipt of the Merger Partner Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by Merger Partner and, assuming the due execution
and delivery by Public Company, constitutes the valid and binding obligation
of Merger Partner, enforceable against such party in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to
general equity principles (the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception").

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Merger Partner does not,
and the consummation by Merger Partner of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall not, (i) conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
Merger Partner or of the charter, bylaws or other organizational document of
any Subsidiary of Merger Partner, each as amended, (ii) conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both) a default (or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any material
benefit) under, or require a consent or waiver under, constitute a change in
control under, require the payment of a penalty under or result in the
imposition of any mortgage, security interest, pledge, lien, charge or
encumbrance of any nature ("Liens") on Merger Partner's or any of its
Subsidiaries' assets under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
Contract required to be disclosed in _Section 3.11(d)_ of the Merger Partner

3.14  _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a)  _Section 3.14(a)_ of the Merger Partner Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all Employee Benefit Plans maintained, or
contributed to, by Merger Partner or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates for the benefit of any current or former employee
or other service provider of Merger Partner or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Merger Partner Employee Plans").

  



  

(b) Each Merger Partner Employee Plan has been established, maintained and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms, ERISA,
the Code and all other applicable laws and the regulations thereunder and each
of Merger Partner and its Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates
has performed all material obligations with respect to such Merger Partner
Employee Plan and has made all required contributions thereto (or reserved
such contributions on the Merger Partner Balance Sheet). Merger Partner and
its Subsidiaries and each of their respective ERISA Affiliates and each Merger
Partner Employee Plan are in compliance in all material respects with the
currently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations
thereunder (including Section 4980B of the Code, Subtitle K, Chapter 100 of
the Code and Sections 601 through 608 and Section 701 et seq. of ERISA). All
filings and reports as to each Merger Partner Employee Plan required to have
been submitted to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or to the
United States Department of Labor have been timely submitted. There is no
audit, investigation or other proceeding (including any voluntary correction
application) pending against or involving any Merger Partner Employee Plan.
There have been no events with respect to any Merger Partner Employee Plan
that could reasonably be expected to result in payment or assessment by or
against Merger Partner or any of its Subsidiaries of any Taxes, including (but
without limitation) any excise Taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977,
4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E, 4980H or 5000 of the Code. With respect to Merger
Partner Employee Plans, no event has occurred, and to the knowledge of Merger
Partner, there exists no condition or set of circumstances (other than
routine claims for benefits) in connection with which Merger Partner or any of
its Subsidiaries could be subject to any liability that is reasonably likely,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Merger Partner Material
Adverse Effect under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law.

  



  

(c) With respect to Merger Partner Employee Plans, there are no benefit
obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued
and there are no benefit obligations that have not been accounted for by
reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with GAAP, on the
Financial Statements of Merger Partner, which obligations are reasonably
likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Merger Partner Material
Adverse Effect. The assets of each Merger Partner Employee Plan that
is funded are reported at their fair market value on the books and records of
such Merger Partner Employee Plan.

  



  

(d) All Merger Partner Employee Plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code have received determination letters from the IRS

letter has been revoked and revocation has not been threatened, and no such
Merger Partner Employee Plan has been amended or operated since the date of
its most recent determination letter or application therefor in any respect,
and no act or omission has occurred, that would adversely affect its
qualification or materially increase its cost.

(e) Neither Merger Partner nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has (i) ever maintained an Employee Benefit Plan
that was ever subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or (ii)
ever been obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No Merger Partner Employee Plan is funded
by, associated with or related to a "voluntary employees' beneficiary
association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No Merger
Partner Employee Plan holds securities issued by Merger Partner or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates. No Merger Partner
Employee Plan is a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section
413(c) of the Code or a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" as defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA.

  



  

(f) There are no loans or extensions of credit by Merger Partner, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliate to any employee or
any other service provider to Merger Partner or any of its Subsidiaries.

provision of minimum essential coverage that is compliant with Section
36B(c)(2)(C) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder to full-time
employees as defined in Section 4980H(b)(4) of the Code and the regulations
issued thereunder. No material excise tax or penalty under the
Affordable Care Act, including Section 4980H of the Code, is outstanding, has
accrued, or has arisen and there has been no change in health plan terms or
coverage that would reasonably be expected to attract an excise tax under
Section 4980H of the Code for the current year. None of Merger Partner nor
its Subsidiaries has received any written notification from any Governmental
Entity concerning potential liability under the Affordable Care Act.

  



  

(h) Each Merger Partner Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) complies in
form and operation with Section 409A of the Code and all IRS regulations and
other guidance promulgated thereunder. No event has occurred that would be
treated by Section 409A(b) of the Code as a transfer of property for
purposes of Section 83 of the Code. No stock option or equity unit option
granted under any Merger Partner Employee Plan has an exercise price that has
been or may be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock or
equity units (as the case may be) as of the date such option was granted or
has any feature for the deferral of compensation other than the deferral of
recognition of income until the later of exercise or disposition of such
option. No nonqualified deferred compensation plan has been administered in a
manner that would cause an excise tax to apply to payments to plan
participants.

Merger Partner, and to Merger Partner's knowledge, any officer, employee or
agent of Merger Partner or any of its Subsidiaries has been convicted of any
crime or engaged in any conduct that has previously caused or would
reasonably be expected to result in (A) disqualification or debarment by
the FDA under 21 U.S.C. Sections 335(a) or (b), or any similar law, rule or
regulation of any other Governmental Entity, or (B) exclusion under 42 U.S.C.

suspension or recall), in each case alleging that such Governmental Entity is
considering such action. Neither Merger Partner nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any of their respective officers, employees or agents have made an untrue
statement of a material fact or fraudulent statement to any Governmental
Entity relating to the Merger Party Authorizations or failed to disclose a
material fact required to be disclosed to any Governmental Entity relating to
the Merger Partner Authorizations.

assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted, and is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction listed on _Section 4.1_ of the Public Company Disclosure
Schedule, which jurisdictions constitute the only jurisdictions in which the
character of the respective properties each owns, operates or leases or the

failures to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, that have not had, and are not reasonably likely to have, a Public
Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Public Company Material Adverse Effect" means any material adverse change,

has a material adverse effect on (i) the business, assets, liabilities,
capitalization, financial condition, or results of operations of
Public Company or Merger Sub and their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or

any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to perform any
of their respective covenants or obligations under this Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that none of the following, to the extent arising after the date
of this Agreement, either alone or in combination, shall be deemed to be a
Public Company Material Adverse Effect, and none of the following shall be
taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be a Public
Company Material Adverse Effect: any change or event caused by or resulting
from (A) changes in prevailing economic or market conditions in the United
States or any other jurisdiction in which such entities have substantial
business operations (except to the extent those changes have
a disproportionate effect on Public Company or Merger Sub and their
respective Subsidiaries relative to the other participants in the industry or
industries in which Public Company, Merger Sub and their respective
Subsidiaries operate), (B) changes or events affecting the industry or
industries in which Public Company and its Subsidiaries operate generally
(except to the extent those changes or events have a disproportionate effect
on Public Company and its Subsidiaries relative to the other participants
in the industry or industries in which Public Company, Merger Sub and their
respective Subsidiaries operate), (C) changes in generally accepted
accounting principles or requirements (except to the extent those changes have
a disproportionate effect on Public Company, Merger Sub and their respective
Subsidiaries relative to the other participants in the industry or industries
in which Public Company and its Subsidiaries operate), (D) changes in laws,
rules or regulations of general applicability or interpretations thereof by
any Governmental Entity (except to the extent those changes have a

disaster or any outbreak of major hostilities in which the United States is
involved or any act of terrorism within the United States or directed against
its facilities or citizens wherever located or any governmental response to
any of the foregoing (except to the extent those changes or events have a
disproportionate effect on Public Company, Merger Sub and their respective
Subsidiaries relative to the other participants in the industry or industries
in which Public Company and its Subsidiaries operate), (F) a change in the
public trading price of Public Company Common Stock or the
implications thereof, (G) a change in the trading volume of Public Company
Common Stock, (H) any failure by Public Company to meet any public estimates
or expectations of Public Company's revenue, earnings or other financial
performance or results of operations for any period, or (I) any failure by
Public Company to meet any guidance, budgets, plans or forecasts of its
revenues, earnings, or other financial performance or results of operations
(but not, in the case of Clauses (F) through (I), the underlying cause of
such changes or failures, unless such changes or failures would otherwise be
excepted from this definition), (J) any failure to receive consents or
approvals in connection with the agreements listed on _Section 4.4(b)_ of the
Public Company Disclosure Schedule or (K) the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger, or the announcement or pendency
thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the terms
"material," "materially" and "materiality" as used in this Agreement with an
initial lower case "m" shall have their respective customary and ordinary
meanings, without regard to the meanings ascribed to Public Company Material
Adverse Effect or Merger Partner Material Adverse Effect, in each case as
defined in this Agreement. Public Company has made available to Merger Partner
complete and accurate copies of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws
and is not in material default under or in material violation of any provision

906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder with respect to the Public Company SEC Reports, and
the statements contained in such certifications were true and correct on the

been (i) any change, event, circumstance, development or effect that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a
Public Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii) except for the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, any other action or event that would have required

Returns were true, correct and complete in all respects. Each of Public
Company and its Subsidiaries has paid on a timely basis all Taxes, whether or

reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the

member of an affiliated group with which it has filed (or been required to
file) consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax Returns, other than a
group of which the common parent is Public Company. With the exception of
customary commercial leases or contracts that are not primarily related to
Taxes entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business and liabilities
thereunder, neither Public Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has any
actual or potential liability under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or

as a transferee or successor, pursuant to any contractual obligation, or
otherwise for any Taxes of any person other than Public Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (ii) is a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity, Tax
sharing, Tax allocation or similar agreement. All Taxes that Public Company

properly paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity, and each of Public
Company and its Subsidiaries has complied with all information reporting and
backup withholding requirements, including the maintenance of required

or, to the knowledge of Public Company, threatened or contemplated. No
deficiencies for Taxes of Public Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been
claimed, proposed or assessed by any Governmental Entity in writing. Neither

or agreed to extend the period for assessment or collection of any Taxes,

prior to the Closing (other than any such Contracts that expire or terminate
before such time in accordance with their terms and not as a result of a
breach or default by Public Company or any of its Subsidiaries), in each case
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception and except to the extent the
failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate,

Effect; and (iii) none of Public Company, its Subsidiaries nor, to the
knowledge of Public Company, any other party, is in breach or violation of,

notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a breach or default by
Public Company, its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Public Company, any
other party under such Contract, except for such breaches, violations or
defaults that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and are not
reasonably likely to have, a Public Company Material Adverse Effect.

Effect:

  



  

(i) Public Company and its Subsidiaries have complied with all applicable
Environmental Laws;

any Environmental Law.

  



  

(c) Neither Public Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
written orders, decrees, injunctions or other arrangements with any

4.14  _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a)  _Section 4.14(a)_ of the Public Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all Employee Benefit Plans maintained, or
contributed to, by Public Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates for the benefit of, any current or former
employee or other service provider of Public Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (together, the "Public Company Employee Plans").

  



    

54 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) Each Public Company Employee Plan has been established, maintained and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms, ERISA,
the Code and all other applicable laws and the regulations thereunder and each
of Public Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates
has performed all material obligations with respect to such Public Company
Employee Plan and has made all required contributions thereto (or reserved
such contributions on the Public Company Balance Sheet). Public Company and
its Subsidiaries and each of their respective ERISA Affiliates and each Public
Company Employee Plan are in compliance in all material respects with the
currently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations
thereunder (including Section 4980B of the Code, Subtitle K, Chapter 100 of
the Code and Sections 601 through 608 and Section 701 et seq. of ERISA). All
filings and reports as to each Public Company Employee Plan required to have
been submitted to the IRS or to the United States Department of Labor have
been timely submitted. There is no audit, investigation or other proceeding
(including any voluntary correction application) pending against or involving
any Public Company Employee Plan. There have been no events with respect to
any Public Company Employee Plan that could reasonably be expected to result
in payment or assessment by or against Public Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of any Taxes, including (but without limitation) any excise Taxes
under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E, 4980H or
5000 of the Code. With respect to the Public Company Employee Plans, no
event has occurred, and to the knowledge of Public Company, there exists no
condition or set of circumstances (other than routine claims for benefits) in
connection with which Public Company or any of its Subsidiaries could be
subject to any liability that is reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Public Company Material Adverse Effect under ERISA, the
Code or any other applicable law.

  



  

(c) With respect to the Public Company Employee Plans, there are no benefit
obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued
and there are no benefit obligations that have not been accounted for by
reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with GAAP, on the
financial statements of Public Company, which obligations are reasonably
likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Public Company Material
Adverse Effect. The assets of each Public Company Employee Plan that
is funded are reported at their fair market value on the books and records of
such Public Company Employee Plan.

  



  

(d) All Public Company Employee Plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code have received determination letters from the IRS
to the effect that such Public Company Employee Plans are qualified and the
plans and trusts related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under
Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code, respectively, of the Code, no such
determination letter has been revoked and revocation has not been threatened,
and no such Public Company Benefit Plan has been amended or operated since
the date of its most recent determination letter or application therefor in
any respect, and no act or omission has occurred, that would adversely affect
its qualification or materially increase its cost.

  



  

(e) Neither Public Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has (i) ever maintained a Public Company Employee
Benefit Plan that was ever subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of
ERISA or (ii) ever been obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No Public Company Employee Plan is
funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary employees' beneficiary
association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No Public
Company Employee Plan holds securities issued by Public Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates. No Public Company
Employee Plan is a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section
413(c) of the Code or a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" as defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA.

(f) There are no loans or extensions of credit by Public Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliate to any employee or
any other service provider to Public Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(g) Public Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable
provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including reporting requirements and
all requirements relating to eligibility waiting periods and the offer of or
provision of minimum essential coverage that is compliant with Section
36B(c)(2)(C) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder to full-time
employees as defined in Section 4980H(b)(4) of the Code and the regulations
issued thereunder. No material excise tax or penalty under the
Affordable Care Act, including Section 4980H of the Code, is outstanding, has
accrued, or has arisen and there has been no change in health plan terms or
coverage that would reasonably be expected to attract an excise tax under
Section 4980H of the Code for the current year. None of Public Company nor
its Subsidiaries has received any notification from any Governmental Entity
concerning potential liability under the Affordable Care Act.

  



  

(h) Each Public Company Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) materially
complies in form and operation with Section 409A of the Code and all IRS
regulations and other guidance thereunder. No event has occurred that would
be treated by Section 409A(b) of the Code as a transfer of property for
purposes of Section 83 of the Code. Since January 1, 2005, no stock option or
equity unit option granted under any Public Company Employee Plan has an
exercise price that has been or may be less than the fair market value of the
underlying stock or equity units (as the case may be) as of the date such
option was granted or has any feature for the deferral of compensation other
than the deferral of recognition of income until the later of exercise or
disposition of such option. No nonqualified deferred compensation plan has
been administered in a manner that would cause an excise tax to apply to
payments to plan participants.

  



  

4.15  _Compliance With Laws_. Public Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
complied in all material respects with, is not in material violation of, and,
as of the date of this Agreement, has not received any notice alleging any
material violation with respect to, any applicable provisions of any statute,
law or regulation with respect to the conduct of its business, or the
ownership or operation of its properties or assets.

  



  

4.16  _Permits and Regulatory Matters_.

  



  

(a) Public Company and each of its Subsidiaries have all material Permits
required to conduct their businesses as currently conducted, including all
such Permits required by any Regulatory Authority, or any other Governmental
Entity exercising comparable authority (the "Public Company Authorizations").

  



  

(b) Public Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with the terms of the Public Company Authorizations. No Public
Company Authorization shall cease to be effective as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) All manufacturing, processing, distribution, labeling, storage, testing,
specifications, sampling, sale or marketing of products or other business
operations performed by or on behalf of Public Company or any of its
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
laws, rules, regulations or orders issued by the any Governmental Entity
having jurisdiction, regulatory or other authority over Public Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. As of the date of this Agreement, except
as set forth in _Section 4.16(c)_ of the Public Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither Public Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notices or other correspondence from any Governmental Entity and to the
knowledge of Public Company, there is no action or proceeding pending or
threatened (including any prosecution, injunction, seizure, civil fine,
suspension or recall), in each case alleging that Public Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is in material noncompliance with any and all applicable
laws, regulations or orders implemented by any Governmental Entity.

  



  

4.17  _Employees_.

  



  

(a) All current and past key employees of Public Company or any of its
Subsidiaries have entered into confidentiality and assignment of inventions
agreements with Public Company, a copy or form of which has previously been
made available to Merger Partner. To the knowledge of Public Company, as of
the date of this Agreement, no employee of Public Company or any Subsidiary of
Public Company is in violation of any term of any patent disclosure
agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a
former employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by
Public Company or any of its Subsidiaries because of the nature of the
business currently conducted by Public Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information of others. To the
knowledge of Public Company, as of the date of this Agreement, no key employee
or group of employees has any plans to terminate employment with Public
Company or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) Neither Public Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has been a party
to or otherwise bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or
other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization.
Neither Public Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has been the subject
of any proceeding asserting that Public Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
committed an unfair labor practice or is seeking to compel it to bargain with
any labor union or labor organization, nor is there or has there been pending
or, to the knowledge of Public Company, threatened, any labor strike, dispute,
walkout, work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving Public Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c) To the knowledge of Public Company, Public Company and its Subsidiaries
are and have been in material compliance with all applicable Laws related to
employment (including verification of employment eligibility), employment
practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours (including,
without limitation, classification of employees) with respect to any employee
(as defined by, or determined in accordance with, applicable Laws). To the
knowledge of Public Company, all employees of Public Company and
its Subsidiaries are citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United
States.

  



    

57

(d) Neither Public Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice of any charge or complaint pending before the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission or other Governmental Entity alleging unlawful
discrimination, harassment, retaliation or any other violation of or non-
compliance with applicable Law relating to the employment, treatment, or
termination of any employees of Public Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Public Company, has any such charge been threatened.
No current or former employee of Public Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has, pursuant to internal complaint procedures, made a written complaint of
discrimination, retaliation or harassment, nor to Public Company's knowledge,
has an oral complaint of any of the foregoing been made.

  



  

(e) Neither Public Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has caused a plant
closing as defined in the WARN Act affecting any site of employment or one or
more operating units within any site of employment, or a mass layoff as
defined in the WARN Act, nor have any of the foregoing been affected by any
transaction or engaged in layoffs or employment terminations sufficient in
number to trigger application of any similar foreign, state or local Law.

  



  

4.18  _Insurance_. Public Company and its Subsidiaries maintain insurance
policies (the "Public Company Insurance Policies"), including insurance
covering directors and officers for securities law and other customary
liabilities, with reputable insurance carriers against all risks of a
character and in such amounts as are usually insured against by
similarly situated companies in the same or similar businesses. Each Public
Company Insurance Policy is in full force and effect. None of the Public
Company Insurance Policies shall terminate or lapse (or be affected in any
other adverse manner) by reason of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Public Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in
all material respects with the provisions of each Public Company Insurance
Policy under which it is the insured party. No insurer under any Public
Company Insurance Policy has cancelled or generally disclaimed liability
under any such policy or indicated to Public Company any written intent to do
so or not to renew any such policy. All claims under the Public Company
Insurance Policies have been filed in a timely fashion.

  



  

4.19  _Section 203 of the DGCL_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of Merger Partner in _Section 3.23_ , the Public Company Board
has taken all actions so that the restrictions contained in Section 203 of the
DGCL applicable to a "business combination" (as defined in Section 203 of the
DGCL) shall not apply to the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement or any of the agreements ancillary hereto.

  



  

4.20  _Brokers; Fees and Expenses_. No agent, broker, investment banker,

result of any action, agreement or commitment of Public Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar
fee or commission in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Public Company is not a party to any other agreements with any
agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other similar firm or
person that have not been made available to Merger Partner and which grant to
such person rights after the Closing.

Business relating to employment, or (ii) Contracts relating to
stock purchases and awards, stock options and other equity arrangements, in
each case relating to compensation.

  



  

4.27  _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Each of Public Company and
Merger Sub hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, none of Merger
Partner nor any other person on behalf of Merger Partner makes any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Merger Partner or with
respect to any other information provided to Public Company, Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (subject to the express representations and
warranties of Merger Partner set forth in _ARTICLE III_ (in each case as
qualified and limited by the Merger Partner Disclosure Schedule)) none of

(ii) each of Public Company and Merger Partner shall not enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement (an "Alternative

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this

effect a Public Company Board Recommendation Change or Merger Partner Board

Superior Proposal or (B) in response to an Intervening Event (in the case of
either clause (A) or clause (B)) if: (i) such board of directors shall have
determined (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that such Public
Company Board Recommendation Change or Merger Partner Board Recommendation
Change, as applicable, would be required to comply with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable law; (ii) such party has provided at least four

counsel), after considering the terms of such offer by the other party, that
the Acquisition Proposal is still a Superior Proposal and a Public Company
Board Recommendation Change or Merger Partner Board Recommendation Change, as
the case may be, would still be required to comply with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable law. In the event of any material amendment to
any Superior Proposal (including any revision in the amount, form or mix of
consideration such party's stockholders would receive as a result of such
potential Superior Proposal), such party shall be required to provide the
other party with notice of such material amendment and there shall be a new

board of directors of such party shall not make a Public Company Board
Recommendation Change or Merger Partner Board Recommendation Change, as
applicable, prior to the end of any such period as so extended.

or a summary of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal

Acquisition Proposal or to enter into discussions or negotiations concerning
any Acquisition Proposal or to provide non-public information with respect
to such to any person, which notice shall be given as promptly as practicable

material terms of an Acquisition Proposal submitted to such party (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours following any such changes), including by
providing a copy of all written proposals and a summary of all oral proposals
or material oral modifications to an earlier written proposal, in each
case relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (C) prior to, or substantially
concurrently with, the provision of any non-public information of such party

or Public Company, as applicable, is unable to take a position with respect
to the bidder's tender offer unless the respective Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that such statement would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law; _provided, further_ , that any such disclosures (other than a "stop,
look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be
a Merger Partner Board Recommendation Change or Public Company Board
Recommendation Change, as applicable, unless the respective Board of Directors
expressly publicly reaffirms its recommendation for the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby within five (5) Business Days after being
requested in writing to do so by the other party, it being understood that any
such request in writing by the other party may only be made once by each
party with respect to a particular disclosure.

Partner) but in no event later than forty-five (45) days after the effective
date of the Registration Statement. If sufficient votes to obtain the Public
Company Voting Proposal and the Other Public Company Voting Proposals, as

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger
service, telecopy, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice or
other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until
it actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any party to

communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to
this Agreement notice in the manner herein set forth.

9.3  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules, Annexes and
Exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are
to be delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the
Parties to this Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements
or representations by or among the Parties hereto, or any of them, written or
oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof and the Parties hereto
expressly disclaim reliance on any such prior understandings, agreements or
representations to the extent not embodied in this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms.

  



  

9.4  _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
shall not, confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder.

  



  

9.5  _Assignment_. No party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of
its performance obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties, and any such assignment or attempted or purported assignment without
such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any purported assignment of rights or delegation of
performance obligations in violation of this _Section 9.5_ is void.

  



  

9.6  _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the Parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the Parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

  



  

9.7  _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered
by electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall
become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties
hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed
and delivered by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered by electronic
mail.

9.8  _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the Parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include
the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form
of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference
to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also
to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." Where this Agreement refers to information
that was "made available," that means that such information was either (i)
provided directly to Public Company or Merger Partner, as applicable, by the
other party, (ii) included in the virtual data rooms established by Public
Company and Merger Partner created for the purposes of providing information
to the other party in connection with this Agreement at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement or (iii)
solely with respect to information made available by Public Company, filed
with and publicly available on the SEC's EDGAR system prior to the date of
this Agreement. When used in the Agreement, "person" shall mean any natural
person, corporation, exempted company, limited liability company, partnership,
exempted limited partnership, association, trust or other entity, including a
Governmental Entity, as applicable. No summary of this Agreement prepared by
any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

9.9  _Governing Law_. All matters arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including its
interpretation, construction, performance and enforcement) shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the
State of Delaware.

  



  

9.10  _Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided herein,
any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

9.11  _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties to this Agreement (a)
consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the
Municipal Courts of the State of New Jersey, Mercer County, or, if that court
does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Camden, New Jersey in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all
claims in respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined
in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement in any other court. Each of the Parties hereto waives any defense
of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so
brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required
of any other party with respect thereto. Any party may make service on another
party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be
served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in
_Section 9.2_. Nothing in this _Section 9.11_ , however, shall affect the
right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
law.

  



  

9.12  _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PUBLIC COMPANY, THE MERGER SUB AND
MERGER PARTNER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PUBLIC COMPANY, THE MERGER SUB OR MERGER
PARTNER IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF
THIS AGREEMENT.

  



  

9.13  _Disclosure Schedule_. Each of the Merger Partner Disclosure Schedule
and the Public Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections
corresponding to the numbered sections contained in this Agreement, and the
disclosure in any section shall qualify only (a) the corresponding section of
this Agreement and (b) the other sections of this Agreement, to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such disclosure that
it also qualifies or applies to such other sections. The inclusion of any
information in the Merger Partner Disclosure Schedule or the Public Company
Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the
terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or would result in
a Merger Partner Material Adverse Effect or a Public Company Material Adverse
Effect, as applicable, or is outside the Ordinary Course of Business. The
Parties acknowledge that _Section 6.13_ of the Public Company Disclosure
Schedule may be updated prior to the Effective Time to reflect any changes in
the individuals to be appointed to the Public Company Board and the class
such individual is to serve or from whom resignations shall be obtained.
