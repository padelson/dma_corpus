                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
     AGREEMENT  AND  PLAN  OF  MERGER,   dated  as  of  October  6,  2000  (this
"Agreement"), among Concord EFS, Inc ., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Orion
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware  corporation and a direct wholly-owned  subsidiary
of  Parent  ("Sub"),  and  Star  Systems,  Inc.,  a  Delaware  corporation  (the
"Company") (Sub and the Company being  hereinafter  collectively  referred to as
the "Constituent Corporations").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS,  the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company
have approved and declared advisable the merger of Sub with and into the Company
with the Company  surviving  (the  "Merger"),  upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein,  whereby each issued and outstanding  Class A Share
of Common Stock,  par value $0.01 per share  ("Class A Shares"),  of the Company
and each issued and outstanding  Class B Share of Common Stock,  par value $0.01
per share of the Company (the "Class B Shares" and collectively with the Class A
Shares,  the "Company  Common  Stock"),  not owned directly or indirectly by the
Company,  will be converted into shares of Common Stock, par value $0.33 1/3 per
share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock");

     WHEREAS,  the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have
determined  that the  Merger is in  furtherance  of and  consistent  with  their
respective  long-term  business  strategies and is in the best interest of their
respective stockholders;

     WHEREAS,  in order to induce  Parent and Sub to enter into this  Agreement,
concurrently  herewith  certain  stockholders  of the Company are entering  into
agreements   with  Parent  dated  as  of  the  date  hereof  (the   "Stockholder
Agreements"),  in the form of the attached  Exhibit A, pursuant to which,  among
other  things,  each  such  stockholder  has  agreed  to vote in  favor  of this
Agreement and the Merger;

     WHEREAS,  it is intended  that the Merger will qualify as a  reorganization
within the meaning of section  368(a) of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as
amended (the "Code"); and

     WHEREAS,  it is intended  that the Merger shall be recorded for  accounting
purposes as a pooling of interests.
<PAGE>

     NOW,  THEREFORE,   in  consideration  of  the  premises,   representations,
warranties and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER
                            Section 1.1 The Merger.
     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions  set forth in this  Agreement,
and in accordance with the Delaware  General  Corporation Law (the "DGCL"),  Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as  hereinafter
defined).  Following the Merger, the separate  corporate  existence of Sub shall
cease  and  the  Company  shall  continue  as  the  surviving  corporation  (the
"Surviving  Corporation")  and shall  succeed  to and  assume all the rights and
obligations of Sub in accordance with the DGCL.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, at the election of Parent, any direct  wholly-owned  Subsidiary
(as  hereinafter  defined) of Parent may be substituted for Sub as a Constituent
Corporation  in the Merger;  provided  that such  substituted  corporation  is a
Delaware  corporation  which is formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has engaged in no other business
activities. In such event, the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment
to this Agreement,  in form and substance reasonably  satisfactory to Parent and
the Company, in order to reflect such substitution.

     Section 1.2  Effective  Time.  The Merger  shall  become  effective  when a
Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL, is filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware;  provided,  however, that, upon mutual written consent of the
Constituent Corporations, the Certificate of Merger may provide for a later date
of  effectiveness  of the  Merger  not  more  than 30 days  after  the  date the
Certificate of Merger is filed. When used in this Agreement, the term "Effective
Time"  shall  mean  the date and time at which  the  Certificate  of  Merger  is
accepted for  recording or such later time  established  by the  Certificate  of
Merger. The filing of the Certificate of Merger shall be made on the date of the
Closing (as hereinafter defined).
     Section 1.3 Effects of the  Merger.  The Merger  shall have the effects set
forth in Sections 259 through 261 of the DGCL.
     Section  1.4  Charter  and  Bylaws;  Directors  and  Officers.  (a)  At the
Effective Time, the  Certificate of  Incorporation,  as amended,  of the Company

<PAGE>

(the "Company  Charter"),  as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be amended so that (i) Article  FOURTH  reads in its  entirety as follows:
"The  total  number  of  shares  of all  classes  of  capital  stock  which  the
Corporation  shall have authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock,  par
value $.01 per share" (ii) subsection (7) of Article SIXTH reads in its entirety
as follows:  "Intentionally  deleted"  and (iii)  Article  SEVENTH  reads in its
entirety as follows: "Intentionally deleted". As so amended, the Company Charter
shall be the Certificate of  Incorporation  of the Surviving  Corporation  until
thereafter  changed or amended as provided  therein or by applicable law. At the
Effective  Time,  the  Bylaws  of Sub,  as in  effect  immediately  prior to the
Effective  Time,  shall  be  the  Bylaws  of  the  Surviving  Corporation  until
thereafter  changed or  amended as  provided  therein or in the  Certificate  of
Incorporation  of the  Surviving  Corporation.  (b) The directors of Sub and the
employee  officers of the Company at the  Effective  Time shall be the directors
and  officers  of  the  Surviving  Corporation,   until  the  earlier  of  their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, as the case may be.
     Section 1.5 Conversion of Securities.  As of the Effective  Time, by virtue
of the Merger and  without  any  action on the part of Sub,  the  Company or the
holders of any securities of the Constituent  Corporations:  (a) Each issued and
outstanding  share of common stock,  par value $0.01 per share,  of Sub shall be
converted into one validly issued,  fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.  (b) All shares of Company Common Stock that
are held in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company shall be canceled and no capital stock of Parent or other  consideration
shall be paid or delivered in exchange  therefor.  (c) Subject to the provisions
of Sections  1.8,  1.10 and 7.1(g)  hereof,  each share of Company  Common Stock
issued and  outstanding  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time  (other than
Dissenting  Shares  (as  hereinafter  defined)  and  shares  to be  canceled  in
accordance  with Section  1.5(b))  shall be converted  into the right to receive
4.6452 (such number being the "Exchange  Ratio") validly issued,  fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the Exchange Ratio being determined
by dividing (i)  24,750,000  by (ii) the  aggregate  number of shares of Company
Common  Stock  outstanding  determined  on a fully  diluted  basis  assuming all
options are fully exercised (the "Company  Diluted Share Number") as of the date
hereof).  In the event the Company Diluted Share Number immediately prior to the
Effective  Time shall be greater than  5,328,036,  the  Exchange  Ratio shall be
proportionately  reduced  and  all  references  to the  Exchange  Ratio  in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be to the Exchange Ratio, as so reduced. All shares
of Company Stock  outstanding  immediately  prior to the Effective Time, when so

<PAGE>

converted,  shall no longer be outstanding and shall  automatically  be canceled
and retired and each holder of a certificate  representing any such shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect  thereto,  except the right to receive (i)
subject to Section 1.6,  certificates  representing  the shares of Parent Common
Stock  into  which  such  shares  are   converted,   (ii)  dividends  and  other
distributions  in  accordance  with  Section  1.7,  and (iii) any cash,  without
interest,  in lieu of  fractional  shares to be issued or paid in  consideration
therefor in accordance  with Section 1.8. (d)  Notwithstanding  anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held of record by stockholders
who shall not have voted  such  shares in favor of the Merger and who shall have
demanded properly in writing appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL  ("Dissenting  Shares") shall not be converted into the right to
receive  Parent  Common Stock and cash as set forth in Section  1.5(c),  but the
holders  thereof  instead shall be entitled to, and the Dissenting  Shares shall
only represent the right to receive, payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance  with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL;  provided,  however,
that (i) if such a holder fails to demand properly in writing from the Surviving
Corporation the appraisal of his or its shares in accordance with Section 262(d)
of the DGCL or,  after making such  demand,  subsequently  delivers an effective
written  withdrawal of such demand, or fails to establish his or its entitlement
to appraisal  rights as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, if so required,  or
(ii) if a court  shall  determine  that such  holder is not  entitled to receive
payment for his or its shares or such  holder  shall  otherwise  lose his or its
appraisal  rights,  then, in any such case,  each share of Company  Common Stock
held of record by such holder or holders shall  automatically  be converted into
and  represent  only the right to receive  Parent  Common  Stock and cash as set
forth in Section  1.5(c),  upon  surrender of the  certificate  or  certificates
representing  such  Dissenting  Shares.  Any cash paid in respect of  Dissenting
Shares shall be paid by the Company  solely with its own funds,  and the Company
shall not be  reimbursed  therefor by Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries  either
directly or indirectly.  (e) In calculating the consideration payable under this
Section  1.5,  Parent  shall  be  entitled  to rely on the  representations  and
warranties contained in Section 3.2(a) and the certificate delivered pursuant to
Section  6.3(f).  If such  representations,  warranties and  certificate are not
correct,  Parent shall have the right to adjust the Exchange  Ratio  accordingly
and,  notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
in no event shall the aggregate merger  consideration  payable by Parent, Sub or
the  Surviving  Corporation  to the holders of equity  interests  in the Company
(including,  without  limitation,  holders of  options) in  connection  with the

<PAGE>

Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby exceed such consideration payable
assuming such representations,  warranties and certificate are correct.  Section
1.6 Delivery of Certificates  and Payment of Cash. (a) At or after the Effective
Time, each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (collectively,  the
"Certificates")   representing   shares  of  Company  Common  Stock  issued  and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively,  the "Company
Stockholders"),  may surrender  such  Certificate  or  Certificates  to Parent's
designee as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent"), together with a letter of
transmittal  in the form  prepared by Parent  (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected,  and risk of loss and title to the  Certificates  shall pass,
only upon actual  delivery of the  Certificates  to the Exchange Agent and shall
contain  instructions  for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in
lieu of  fractional  shares)  (the  "Transmittal  Letter").  Promptly  after the
Effective  Time,  Parent  shall  deposit with the  Exchange  Agent  certificates
representing  the shares of Parent  Common  Stock  issuable  pursuant to Section
1.5(c) for exchange with outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and cash as
required to make payments in lieu of any fractional  shares  pursuant to Section
1.8 (such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions  with  respect  hereto,  being  hereinafter  referred  to  as  the
"Exchange  Fund").  The  Exchange  Agent shall  deliver the Parent  Common Stock
contemplated  to be issued  pursuant to Section 1.5(c) out of the Exchange Fund.
Upon surrender for cancellation to the Exchange Agent of all  Certificates  held
by any Company Stockholder, together with the Transmittal Letter, duly executed,
such  Company  Stockholder  shall be entitled to receive in exchange  therefor a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into
which the shares  represented by the  Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall have been converted at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.5(c), cash
in lieu of any  fractional  share in  accordance  with  Section  1.8 and certain
dividends  and other  distributions  in  accordance  with  Section  1.7, and any
Certificate so surrendered  shall  forthwith be canceled.  (b) Each  Transmittal
Letter  shall  contain   representations   and  warranties  by  the  Person  (as
hereinafter defined) surrendering any Certificates similar to those contained in
Section 3.31. Each certificate  delivered pursuant to Section 1.6 evidencing any
Parent  Common  Stock  shall  bear  a  legend  substantially  as  follows:  "THE
SECURITIES  REPRESENTED BY THIS  CERTIFICATE  HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES  ACT  OF  1933,  AS  AMENDED,  OR ANY  STATE  SECURITIES  LAWS.  SUCH
SECURITIES  HAVE BEEN  ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER  HEREOF NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR
RESALE IN CONNECTION  WITH, ANY  DISTRIBUTION  THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED.  SUCH SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR

OTHERWISE  TRANSFERRED,  PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED  UNLESS (A) THE SECURITIES HAVE
BEEN REGISTERED  UNDER SUCH ACT AND ANY AND ALL SUCH OTHER  APPLICABLE  LAWS, OR
(B) PARENT  RECEIVES AN OPINION OF  COUNSEL,  IN FORM AND  SUBSTANCE  REASONABLY
SATISFACTORY  TO PARENT,  TO THE EFFECT THAT  REGISTRATION OF SUCH SECURITIES IS
NOT REQUIRED."

     Section 1.7 Dividends;  Transfer Taxes; Withholding.  No dividends or other
distributions  that are declared on or after the Effective Time on Parent Common
Stock,  or are payable to the  Company  Stockholders  on or after the  Effective
Time,  will be paid to any Person  entitled by reason of the Merger to receive a
certificate  representing  Parent Common Stock until such Person  surrenders the
related  Certificate  or  Certificates,  as provided in Section 1.6, and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares will be paid to any such Person pursuant to
Section 1.8 until such Person  shall so  surrender  the related  Certificate  or
Certificates.  Subject to the effect of applicable  law,  there shall be paid to
each record holder of a new certificate  representing  such Parent Common Stock:
(i) at the time of such surrender or as promptly as practicable thereafter,  the
amount of any dividends or other distributions  theretofore paid with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such new certificate and having
a record date on or after the  Effective  Time and a payment  date prior to such
surrender;  (ii) at the  appropriate  payment date or as promptly as practicable
thereafter,  the amount of any  dividends  or other  distributions  payable with
respect to such  shares of Parent  Common  Stock and having a record  date on or
after the  Effective  Time but prior to such  surrender and a payment date on or
subsequent  to such  surrender;  and (iii) at the time of such  surrender  or as
promptly as practicable thereafter,  the amount of any cash payable with respect
to a  fractional  share of Parent  Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section  1.8. In no event shall the Person  entitled to receive such
dividends  or  other  distributions  or cash in lieu  of  fractional  shares  be
entitled to receive interest on such dividends or other distributions or cash in
lieu of fractional  shares.  If any cash or certificate  representing  shares of
Parent  Common  Stock is to be paid to or  issued in a name  other  than that in
which the Certificate  surrendered in exchange therefor is registered,  it shall
be a condition of such exchange that the  Certificate  so  surrendered  shall be
properly  endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting  such  exchange  shall  pay to Parent  any  transfer  or other  taxes
required  by reason of the  issuance of  certificates  for such shares of Parent
Common  Stock  in a name  other  than  that  of  the  registered  holder  of the
Certificate  surrendered,  or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable.  Parent shall be entitled to deduct

<PAGE>

and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Person such  amounts as Parent is required  to deduct and  withhold  with
respect to the making of such payment  under the Code or under any  provision of
state,  local or foreign tax law. To the extent that  amounts are so withheld by
Parent,  such  withheld  amounts  shall  be  treated  for all  purposes  of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person who  otherwise  would have  received
the  payment  in respect of which such  deduction  and  withholding  was made by
Parent.

     Section 1.8 No Fractional Securities. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional  shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of  Certificates  pursuant to this Article I, and no Parent dividend or
other  distribution or stock split shall relate to any fractional  share, and no
fractional  share shall entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a securityholder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional share, each holder
of Company Common Stock who would  otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of
a share of Parent  Common  Stock upon  surrender  of  Certificates  for exchange
pursuant to this  Article I will be paid an amount in cash  (without  interest),
rounded  down to the  nearest  cent,  determined  by  multiplying  (i) the  last
reported  sale price per share of Parent  Common  Stock on the  Nasdaq  National
Market System ("Nasdaq") on the Closing Date (or, if the shares of Parent Common
Stock do not trade on Nasdaq on such date, the trading day immediately preceding
the Closing  Date) by (ii) the  fractional  interest to which such holder  would
otherwise be entitled. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional share interests, the
Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall deposit such amount with
the  Exchange  Agent and shall cause the Exchange  Agent to forward  payments to
such holders of fractional share interests subject to and in accordance with the
terms of Section 1.7 and this Section 1.8.

     Section  1.9 Return of Exchange  Fund.  Any  portion of the  Exchange  Fund
deposited  with the Exchange  Agent which remains  undistributed  to the Company
Stockholders  for 60 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon  demand  of  Parent,  and  any  such  Company  Stockholders  who  have  not
theretofore  complied with this Article I shall  thereafter  look only to Parent
for  payment  of  their  claim  for  Parent  Common  Stock,  any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Common  Stock.  Neither  Parent nor the Surviving  Corporation
shall  be  liable  to  any  former  holder  of  Company  Common  Stock  for  any
consideration  payable in accordance with this Article I which is delivered to a

<PAGE>

public  official  pursuant  to any  applicable  abandoned  property,  escheat or
similar law.

     Section  1.10   Adjustment  of  Exchange   Ratio.   In  the  event  of  any
reclassification,  stock split or stock  dividend  with respect to Parent Common
Stock or any change or conversion  of Parent Common Stock into other  securities
(or if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing should occur) prior to
the Effective Time, appropriate and proportionate adjustments,  if any, shall be
made to the Exchange  Ratio,  and all  references to the Exchange  Ratio in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be to the Exchange  Ratio, as so adjusted.

     Section  1.11 No Further  Ownership  Rights in Company  Common  Stock.  All
shares  of Parent  Common  Stock  issued  upon the  surrender  for  exchange  of
Certificates  in  accordance  with the  terms  hereof  (including  any cash paid
pursuant  to  Section  1.8)  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  issued  in  full
satisfaction  of all rights  pertaining  to the shares of Company  Common  Stock
represented by such Certificates.

     Section 1.12 Closing of Company  Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereafter be made on the records of the Company. If,
after  the  Effective  Time,   Certificates   are  presented  to  the  Surviving
Corporation  or Parent,  such  Certificates  shall be canceled and  exchanged as
provided in this Article I.

     Section 1.13 Lost  Certificates.  If any Certificate  shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed,  upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such  Certificate  to be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the  Exchange  Agent,  the posting by such  Person of a bond,  in such
amount as Parent or the  Exchange  Agent may direct,  as  indemnity  against any
claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent  with  respect  to such  Certificate,  the  Exchange  Agent  will issue in
exchange for such lost,  stolen or destroyed  Certificate,  the shares of Parent
Common  Stock to which the holder  thereof is entitled  pursuant to Section 1.5,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holder
thereof  is  entitled  pursuant  to  Section  1.8 and  any  dividends  or  other
distributions to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7.

     Section 1.14 Further  Assurances.  If at any time after the Effective  Time
the Surviving  Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of

<PAGE>

sale,  assignments  or  assurances  or any other acts or things  are  necessary,
desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise,  in
the Surviving  Corporation  its right,  title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, privileges,  powers,  franchises,  properties or assets of either of
the Constituent Corporations, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement,  the Surviving  Corporation  and its proper officers and directors or
their designees  shall be authorized to execute and deliver,  in the name and on
behalf of either of the Constituent Corporations, all such deeds, bills of sale,
assignments  and  assurances  and to do,  in the name and on  behalf  of  either
Constituent  Corporation,  all such other  acts and things as may be  necessary,
desirable  or proper to vest,  perfect or confirm  the  Surviving  Corporation's
right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges,  powers,
franchises,  properties or assets of such Constituent  Corporation and otherwise
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE II

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB
     Parent and Sub represent and warrant, jointly and severally, to the Company
as follows:
<PAGE>

     Section 2.1  Organization,  Standing and Power. Each of Parent and Sub is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the State of Delaware and has the requisite  corporate power and authority to
carry on its  business  as now being  conducted.  Each of Parent and Sub is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction  where the
character  of its  properties  owned or held  under  lease or the  nature of its
activities makes such qualification or good standing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate,  have a Material  Adverse  Effect on  Parent.  For  purposes  of this
Agreement,  "Material  Adverse Change" or "Material  Adverse Effect" means, when
used with  respect  to Parent or the  Company,  as the case may be,  any  event,
change or effect that  individually  or when taken  together with all other such
events,  changes or effects is or could  reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to the business, prospects, assets, liabilities,  financial condition or
results of operations of Parent and its  Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole, or the
Company and its Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole, as the case may be. None of the
following  shall be deemed by itself or by themselves,  to constitute a Material
Adverse Change or Material Adverse Effect: (i) conditions affecting the industry
in which the Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, operates or the U.S. economy as a whole, or (ii) any effect arising
from the public announcement of this Agreement.

     Section 2.2 Capital  Structure.  (a) As of the date hereof,  the authorized
capital stock of Parent  consists of 500,000,000  shares of Parent Common Stock.
At the close of business on September 29, 2000, (i) 215,364,106 shares of Parent
Common  Stock were issued and  outstanding,  all of which were  validly  issued,
fully paid and  nonassessable and free of preemptive  rights,  (ii) no shares of
Parent  Common Stock were held in the treasury of Parent or by  Subsidiaries  of
Parent,  and (iii)  24,220,513  shares of Parent  Common Stock were reserved for
issuance pursuant to outstanding options,  warrants,  convertible securities and
rights  ("Parent  Stock  Options"),  to purchase or otherwise  acquire shares of
Parent  Common  Stock under  Parent's  benefit  plans or other  arrangements  or
pursuant to any plans or  arrangements  assumed by Parent in connection with any
acquisition,  business  combination or similar  transaction  (collectively,  the
"Parent Stock Plans"). As of the date of this Agreement,  except as set forth in
Section  2.2(a) of the letter  dated as of the date  hereof  from  Parent to the
Company, which letter relates to this Agreement and is designated therein as the
Parent Letter (the "Parent Letter"),  except as set forth above,  except for the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Parent Stock Plans and

<PAGE>

except in connection with acquisitions,  mergers or other business  combinations
involving Parent or its Subsidiaries (the "Parent  Transactions"),  no shares of
capital  stock or other voting  securities  of Parent were issued,  reserved for
issuance or  outstanding.  All of the shares of Parent Common Stock  issuable in
exchange for Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in accordance  with this
Agreement will be, when so issued, duly authorized,  validly issued,  fully paid
and  nonassessable  and  free  of  preemptive  rights.  As of the  date  of this
Agreement,  except for (i) this Agreement and (ii) as set forth above, there are
no options,  warrants,  calls, rights, puts or agreements to which Parent or any
of its  Subsidiaries  is a party  or by which  any of them is  bound  obligating
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver, sell or redeem, or cause to
be issued,  delivered,  sold or redeemed, any additional shares of capital stock
(or  other  voting  securities  or equity  equivalents)  of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or obligating Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to grant, extent or
enter into any such option,  warrant,  call, right, put or agreement.  (b) As of
the date of this Agreement,  each  outstanding  share of capital stock (or other
voting  security  or equity  equivalent)  of each  Subsidiary  of Parent is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and each such share (or
other  voting  security  or equity  equivalent)  is owned by  Parent or  another
Subsidiary of Parent, free and clear of all security interests,  liens,  claims,
pledges,  options,  rights of first refusal,  agreements,  limitations on voting
rights,  charges and other encumbrances of any nature  whatsoever,  except where
any failure(s) be so duly authorized, valid issued, fully paid and nonassessable
or owned would not have,  individually or in the aggregate,  a Material  Adverse
Effect  on  Parent.  (c)  Except as set forth in  Section  2.2(c) of the  Parent
Letter,  Exhibit 21 to  Parent's  Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 1999, as filed with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (the
"SEC") (the  "Parent  Annual  Report"),  contained a true,  accurate and correct
statement in all material respects of all of the information  required to be set
forth therein by the regulations of the SEC. (d) For purposes of this Agreement,
"Subsidiary"  means any corporation,  partnership,  limited  liability  company,
joint  venture,  trust,  association  or other  entity  of which  Parent  or the
Company,  as the case may be (either alone or through or together with any other
Subsidiary),  owns,  directly or  indirectly,  50% or more of the stock or other
equity  interests  the holders of which are  generally  entitled to vote for the
election of the board of directors or other governing body of such  corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other entity.

     Section 2.3  Authority.  On or prior to the date of this  Agreement (i) the
Board of Directors of Sub approved this  Agreement  and declared this  Agreement

<PAGE>

and the Merger  advisable  and fair to and in the best  interest  of Sub and its
sole stockholder, and (ii) the Board of Directors of Parent approved and adopted
this  Agreement  and approved the issuance of Parent  Common Stock in connection
with the Merger (the "Share  Issuance"),  both in accordance  with the DGCL. The
Board of Directors of Parent has  approved  the other  agreements  to be entered
into by it as contemplated hereby (such other agreements,  the "Parent Ancillary
Agreements").  Parent has the requisite  corporate  power and authority to enter
into this  Agreement and the Parent  Ancillary  Agreements,  to  consummate  the
transactions  contemplated  hereby and thereby and to effect the Share Issuance.
Sub has all corporate  power and  authority to enter into this  Agreement and to
consummate the transactions  contemplated  hereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Parent and Sub and the Parent Ancillary  Agreements by Parent,
and the consummation by Parent and Sub of the transactions  contemplated  hereby
and thereby,  have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of Parent and Sub, subject to the filing of appropriate Merger documents as
required by the DGCL. This Agreement and the  consummation  of the  transactions
contemplated  hereby have been  approved by the sole  stockholder  of Sub.  This
Agreement  has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Sub and the Parent
Ancillary  Agreements executed as of the date hereof have been duly executed and
delivered by Parent. Assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery by
the other parties thereto and the validity and binding effect hereof and thereof
on the other parties thereto,  this Agreement  constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Sub enforceable against each of them in accordance with
its terms,  and each of the Parent  Ancillary  Agreements,  upon  execution  and
delivery thereof by Parent,  will constitute the valid and binding obligation of
Parent  enforceable   against  it  in  accordance  with  its  terms,  except  as
enforceability   may  be   limited   by   applicable   bankruptcy,   insolvency,
reorganization,   moratorium  or  similar  laws  affecting  the  enforcement  of
creditors'  rights  generally and by the effect of general  principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

     Section  2.4  Consents  and  Approvals;  No  Violation.  Assuming  that all
consents, approvals,  authorizations and other actions described in this Section
2.4 have been obtained and all filings and obligations described in this Section
2.4 have been made, except as set forth in Section 2.4 of the Parent Letter, the
execution  and  delivery  of this  Agreement  by Parent and Sub,  and the Parent
Ancillary Agreements by Parent, do not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated  hereby and thereby and compliance  with the provisions  hereof and
thereof will not, result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice

<PAGE>

or lapse of time,  or both)  under,  or give to  others a right of  termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a material benefit
under,  or result in the  creation  of any lien,  security  interest,  charge or
encumbrance  upon  any of the  properties  or  assets  of  Parent  or any of its
Subsidiaries  under,  any  provision of (i) the Parent  Charter or the Bylaws of
Parent (the "Parent  Bylaws") or the Certificate of  Incorporation  or Bylaws of
Sub, (ii) the comparable  charter or  organization  documents of any of Parent's
Subsidiaries,  (iii)  any  loan  or  credit  agreement,  note,  bond,  mortgage,
indenture, lease or other agreement,  instrument, permit, concession,  franchise
or  license  applicable  to  Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries  or any of their
respective properties or assets, or (iv) any judgment,  order, decree,  statute,
law,  ordinance,  rule  or  regulation  applicable  to  Parent  or  any  of  its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, other than, in the
case of clauses (ii),  (iii) and (iv), any such  violations,  defaults,  rights,
liens, security interests,  charges or encumbrances that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, materially impair
the ability of Parent or Sub to perform their respective  obligations  hereunder
or, in the case of Parent, under the Parent Ancillary Agreements, or prevent the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby by Parent
or Sub.  Except as set forth in Section 2.4 of the Parent  Letter,  no filing or
registration  with,  or  authorization,  consent or  approval  of, any  domestic
(federal and state),  foreign or supranational court,  commission,  governmental
body,  regulatory  agency,  authority or tribunal (a  "Governmental  Entity") is
required by or with respect to Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries  in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Sub or the Parent
Ancillary Agreements by Parent or is necessary for the consummation by Parent or
Sub of the Merger and the other  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement or
the Parent Ancillary Agreements,  except for (i) in connection, or in compliance
with the  provisions  of the  Bank  Holding  Company  Act of  1956,  as  amended
(together  with the  rules and  regulations  promulgated  thereunder,  the "Bank
Act"), and the Hart-Scott-Rodino  Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended
(together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "HSR Act"),
(ii) the filing of the  Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware and  appropriate  documents  with the relevant  authorities of
other states in which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries is qualified to do
business,  (iii) such  filings,  authorizations,  orders and approvals as may be
required by state  takeover  laws (the "State  Takeover  Approvals"),  (iv) such
filings as may be required in  connection  with the taxes  described in Sections
5.7, 5.8 and 5.9, (v) applicable  requirements,  if any, of state  securities or
"blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky Laws") and Nasdaq, (vi) applicable  requirements,  if

<PAGE>

any, under foreign laws and (vii) such other consents,  orders,  authorizations,
registrations,  declarations  and filings the failure of which to be obtained or
made would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
on  Parent,  materially  impair  the  ability  of Parent or Sub to  perform  its
obligations  hereunder  or, in the case of Parent,  under the  Parent  Ancillary
Agreements,  or prevent the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby by Parent or Sub.

     Section 2.5 SEC Documents and Other Reports.  Parent has filed all required
documents with the SEC between  January 1, 2000 and the date hereof (the "Parent
SEC Documents").  As of their respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of
the last amendment,  the Parent SEC Documents  complied in all material respects
with the  requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended  (together with
the rules and regulations promulgated  thereunder,  the "Securities Act") or the
Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as  amended  (together  with the  rules  and
regulations promulgated thereunder, to "Exchange Act"), as the case may be, and,
at the  respective  times they were  filed,  none of the  Parent  SEC  Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein,
in light of the  circumstances  under which they were made, not misleading.  The
consolidated financial statements  (including,  in each case, any notes thereto)
of Parent  included  in the  Parent  SEC  Documents  complied  as to form in all
material  respects with  applicable  accounting  requirements  and the published
rules  and  regulations  of the SEC  with  respect  thereto,  were  prepared  in
accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles  ("GAAP") (except, in
the case of the  unaudited  statements,  as  permitted  by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
applied on a  consistent  basis  during the periods  involved  (except as may be
indicated  therein or in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material
respects  the  consolidated  financial  position of Parent and its  consolidated
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated  results of
their  operations and their  consolidated  cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject,  in the  case  of  unaudited  statements,  to  normal  year-end  audit
adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein). Except as disclosed
in the  Parent SEC  Documents  or as  required  by GAAP,  Parent has not,  since
December  31,  1999,  made any material  change in the  accounting  practices or
policies  applied in the  preparation  of financial  statements  included in the
Parent SEC Documents.

     Section 2.6 Actions and Proceedings.  Except as set forth in the Parent SEC
Documents  filed prior to the date of this  Agreement and except as set forth in

<PAGE>

Section 2.6 of the Parent Letter,  as of the date hereof,  there are no actions,
suits, labor disputes or other litigation,  legal or administrative  proceedings
or  governmental   investigations  pending  or,  to  the  Knowledge  of  Parent,
threatened  against  Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries  or, to the Knowledge of
Parent,  any of its or their present or former officers,  directors,  employees,
consultants, agents or stockholders, as such, or any of its or their properties,
assets or business  relating to the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement
and the  Parent  Ancillary  Agreements.  Except as set forth in the  Parent  SEC
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement,  and except as set forth in

such  Company  Plans  qualify in form with Section  401(a) of the Code,  and the
Company is not aware of any reason why any such Company Plan is not so qualified
in  operation.  Neither  the Company  nor any of its ERISA  Affiliates  has been

withholding  taxes or penalties for failure to comply with any of the foregoing,
except as would not,  individually or in the aggregate,  have a Material Adverse
Effect on the  Company.  Neither the Company  nor any of its  Subsidiaries  is a

Company and, to the Knowledge of the Company,  the other parties thereto, and is

     Section 3.27 Pooling of Interests;  Reorganization. To the Knowledge of the
Company,  neither  it nor any of its  Subsidiaries  has (i) taken any  action or
failed to take any action which action or failure would jeopardize the treatment
of the Merger as a pooling of interests  for  accounting  purposes or (ii) taken
any action or failed to take any action  which action or failure  would  prevent
the Merger from  qualifying  as a  reorganization  within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

<PAGE>

     Section  3.29  Hart-Scott-Rodino.  The  Company  is its own sole  "ultimate
parent entity" (as defined in 16 C.F.R. Section 801.1(a)(3) (1995)).

     Section 3.30 Stockholder Information.  None of the information presented to
the  Company's   stockholders  in  connection  with  the   solicitation  of  the
Stockholder  Consent (the  "Stockholder  Information")  will, at the time of the
mailing or  presentation  of such  information  or at the effective  time of the
Stockholder Consent,  contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to
make the statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made,  not  misleading.  If at any  time  prior  to the  effective  time  of the
Stockholder  Consent any event with  respect to the  Company,  its  officers and
directors or any of its Subsidiaries  shall occur which is required at that time
to be described in the Stockholder  Information in order for this representation
to be true and correct,  the Company  shall  advise  Parent and, if requested by
Parent,  promptly  notify the  stockholders  of the Company of such  event.  The
Company will comply with the  provisions of the DGCL in seeking the  Stockholder
Consent and notifying its stockholders of the taking of such action by consent.

     Section 3.31 Investor  Qualifications.  (a) Each Company  Stockholder is an
"accredited"  investor  as such term is  defined  in  Regulation  D  promulgated
pursuant to the  Securities  Act.  Each Company  Stockholder,  by reason of such
Company Stockholder's  knowledge in business or financial matters,  either alone
or with a Company  Stockholder  representative,  is  capable of  evaluating  the
merits and risks of Company Stockholder's investment in Parent Common Stock, and
will  be  making  an  informed   investment  decision  in  connection  with  its
acquisition  of the Parent Common Stock and the  Stockholder  Consent.  (b) Each
Company  Stockholder  is acquiring or will be acquiring  the Parent Common Stock
for investment for such Company  Stockholder's own account,  not as a nominee or
agent,  for investment  purposes only and not with the view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof. Each Company Stockholder  understands
that any offer and sale of the Parent Common Stock pursuant hereto has not been,
and will not be,  registered  under the  Securities  Act by  reason of  Parent's
reliance  on a  specific  exemption  from  the  registration  provisions  of the
Securities  Act that depends upon,  among other things,  the bona fide nature of
the  investment  intent of the  Company  Stockholders  and the  accuracy  of the
representations as expressed herein. Each Company  Stockholder,  if other than a
natural  person,  has not been formed for the specific  purpose of acquiring the
Parent   Common  Stock.   (c)  There  are   substantial   restrictions   on  the

<PAGE>

transferability  of the Parent Common Stock. The Parent Common Stock is not, and
Company  Stockholders have no right (other than as set forth in the Registration
Rights  Agreement) to require that the Parent  Common Stock be registered  under
the  Securities  Act.  Accordingly,  Company  Stockholders  may have to hold the
Parent  Common  Stock  indefinitely  and it  may  not be  possible  for  Company
Stockholders to liquidate their Parent Common Stock. (d) No Company  Stockholder
will be acquiring  the Parent  Common Stock as a result of or  subsequent to any
advertisement,   article,   notice  or  other  communication  published  in  any
newspaper,  magazine or similar media or broadcast over  television or radio, or
presented at any seminar or meeting, or any solicitation of purchase by a person
not previously known to the Company  Stockholders in connection with investments
in securities generally.  (e) The Parent Common Stock acquired hereunder may not
be offered, sold, or otherwise  transferred,  pledged or hypothecated unless (i)
such Parent Common Stock shall have been registered under the Securities Act and
any and all such other  applicable  laws or (ii)  Parent  receives an opinion of
counsel,  in form and  substance  satisfactory  to Parent,  to the  effect  that
registration of such securities is not required.

accordance with the terms hereof,  the Company shall not, nor shall it authorize
or permit  any of its  Subsidiaries  to,  nor shall it  authorize  or permit any

that prior to the effective date of the Stockholder  Consent,  nothing contained
in this  Agreement  shall  prevent  the Company or its Board of  Directors  from
furnishing   non-public   information  to,  or  entering  into   discussions  or
negotiations  with,  any  Person in  connection  with an  unsolicited  bona fide
written  Takeover  Proposal by such  Person,  if and only to the extent that (w)
such Takeover  Proposal  would,  if  consummated,  result in a transaction  that
would,  in the reasonable  good-faith  judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company, after consultation with its financial advisors, result in a transaction
more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than
the Merger (any such more favorable  Takeover Proposal being referred to in this
Agreement as a "Superior  Proposal") and, in the reasonable  good-faith judgment
of the Board of Directors of the Company,  after consultation with its financial
advisors,  the Person making such Superior  Proposal has the financial  means to
conclude  such  transaction,  (x) the failure to take such  action  would in the
reasonable  good-faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, on the
basis of the advice of the outside corporate counsel of the Company, violate the
fiduciary  duties of the Board of  Directors  of the  Company  to the  Company's
stockholders  under  applicable  law, (y) prior to  furnishing  such  non-public
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations  with, such Person,
such Board of Directors  receives  from such Person an executed  confidentiality
agreement with provisions not less favorable to the Company than those contained

<PAGE>

in the  Confidentiality  Agreement (as defined  below) and (z) the Company shall
have fully  complied  with this Section  4.2.  For  purposes of this  Agreement,
"Takeover  Proposal" means any proposal or offer, or any expression of interest,
by any Person other than Parent or Sub relating to the Company's  willingness or
ability to receive or discuss a proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation or
other business  combination  involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any  proposal  or offer to acquire in any  manner,  directly  or  indirectly,  a
substantial  equity interest in, a substantial  portion of the voting securities
of,  or a  substantial  portion  of  the  assets  of the  Company  or any of its
Subsidiaries,  other than the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.  (b)
The Company shall advise Parent orally  (within one business day) and in writing
(as promptly as  practicable)  of (i) any Takeover  Proposal or any inquiry with
respect to or which could lead to any Takeover Proposal, (ii) the material terms
of such  Takeover  Proposal and (iii) the identity of the Person making any such
Takeover  Proposal or  inquiry.  The  Company  will keep Parent  informed of the
status and details of any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry.

     Section 4.3 Third Party Standstill  Agreements.  During the period from the
date of this  Agreement  through  the  Effective  Time,  the  Company  shall not
terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality agreement
relating to a Takeover Proposal or standstill  agreement to which the Company or
any of its  Subsidiaries  is a party (other than any involving  Parent).  During
such period,  the Company  agrees to enforce,  to the fullest  extent  permitted
under applicable law, the provisions of any such agreements,  including, but not
limited to, obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and
to enforce  specifically  the terms and  provisions  thereof in any court of the
United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction.

     Section 4.4 Pooling of  Interests;  Reorganization.  During the period from
the date of this Agreement  through the Effective  Time,  unless the other party
shall  otherwise agree in writing,  none of Parent,  the Company or any of their
respective  Subsidiaries  shall (a)  knowingly  take or fail to take any action,
which  action or  failure  would  jeopardize  the  treatment  of the Merger as a
pooling of interests for  accounting  purposes or (b) knowingly  take or fail to
take any  action,  which  action  or  failure  would  prevent  the  Merger  from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
Between  the date of this  Agreement  and the  Effective  Time,  Parent  and the
Company each shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably  necessary
in order for the Merger to be treated as a pooling of interests  for  accounting
purposes.

                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     Section  5.1  Stockholder  Consent.  (a)  The  Company  will,  as  soon  as
practicable   following  the  date  of  this  Agreement,   duly  submit  to  its
stockholders  this Agreement for the purpose of considering the approval of this
Agreement and the Merger,  all in accordance  with the DGCL, the Company Charter
and the Company  Bylaws.  The  Company  will,  through  its Board of  Directors,
recommend to its  stockholders  the approval and adoption of this  Agreement and
shall use all  commercially  reasonable  efforts  (including  direction from the
Company's Board of Directors that the  stockholders  take such action by written
consent in accordance with the Company  Charter) to solicit such approval by its
stockholders in the form of a written  consent in form and substance  reasonably
acceptable to Parent (the "Stockholder  Consent"). In connection with soliciting
such  consent,  the Company and Parent  shall  promptly  prepare an  information
statement.  Parent and the  Company  shall  furnish all  information  concerning
Parent or the  Company,  as the case may be, as may be  reasonably  requested in
connection  with  such  information  statement.  If at  any  time  prior  to the
effective  time of the  Stockholder  Consent,  any  information  relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors,

amendment or supplement  to such  information  statement,  so that such document
would not  include  any  misstatement  of a  material  fact or omit to state any

time  subsequent to the date hereof that this  Agreement is no longer  advisable
and recommends that the stockholders of the Company reject it. The Company shall

restrictions  applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,  the Company
shall,  and shall cause each of its  Subsidiaries to, afford to the accountants,

Agreement  through  the  Effective  Time,  all  of  its  employees,   customers,
properties,  assets,  books,  contracts,  commitments  and  records  (including,
without limitation, the work papers of independent accountants, if available and

the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly
to Parent  all  information  concerning  its  business,  properties,  assets and
personnel  as  Parent  may  reasonably  request.  Parent  shall  afford  to  the
accountants,  counsel,  financial  advisors  and  other  representatives  of the
Company  reasonable  access to the  executive  officers of Parent  during normal
business  hours  during the period from the date of this  Agreement  through the
Effective Time. No  investigation  pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall affect any
representation  or  warranty  in  this  Agreement  of any  party  hereto  or any
condition to the  obligations of the parties hereto.  All  information  obtained
pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be kept  confidential  in accordance with the
Confidentiality  Agreement,  dated July 12, 2000 between  Parent and the Company
(the "Confidentiality Agreement").

(including,  without limitation, filing fees under the Bank Act and the HSR Act)
shall be divided equally between Parent and the Company.

     Section 5.4 Company  Stock Plan.  (a) At the Effective  Time,  each Company
Stock  Option  which is  outstanding  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time
pursuant  to the  Company  Stock Plan shall  become and  represent  an option to
purchase  the number of shares of Parent  Common Stock (a  "Substitute  Option")
(decreased to the nearest full share)  determined by multiplying  (i) the number
of  shares  of  Company  Common  Stock  subject  to such  Company  Stock  Option
immediately  prior  to the  Effective  Time by (ii)  the  Exchange  Ratio  at an
exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest tenth
of a cent)  equal to the  exercise  price  per  share of  Company  Common  Stock
immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time divided by the Exchange  Ratio.  With
respect to Company  Stock  Options  that are not  Incentive  Stock  Options  (as
defined in Section 422 of the Code), Parent shall pay cash to holders of Company
Stock Options in lieu of issuing  fractional  shares of Parent Common Stock upon
the exercise of Substitute  Options for shares of Parent Common Stock. After the
Effective  Time,  except as provided above in this Section 5.4, each  Substitute
Option  shall  be  exercisable  upon  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as were
applicable  under  the  related  Company  Stock  Option at the  Effective  Time.
Notwithstanding  anything  in  Section  5.4 to  the  contrary,  the  adjustments
provided  therein with respect to any Company  Stock  Options that are Incentive
Stock Options shall be effected in a manner  consistent with the requirements of
Section  424(a) of the Code.  The  Company  shall take all  necessary  action to
implement the provisions of this Section 5.4(a) including,  without  limitation,
any action  necessary or advisable to be taken by the Committee (as such term is
defined in the  Company  Stock  Plan).  (b) Any shares of Company  Common  Stock
issued upon exercise of options under the Company Stock Plan have been issued in
compliance  with  all  appropriate  securities  laws  and  are  subject  to  all
appropriate  restrictions  on transfer in connection with such laws. (c) As soon
as reasonably  practicable  after the Effective  Time but in any event within 30
days after the Effective  Time,  Parent shall file a  registration  statement on
Form S-8 (or any  successor  or other  appropriate  form) with respect to Parent
Common  Stock  subject to  Substitute  Options,  or shall cause such  Substitute
Options  to be deemed to be issued  pursuant  to a Parent  Stock  Plan for which
shares of Parent  Common Stock have been  previously  registered  pursuant to an
appropriate  registration  form. In addition to any  requirement  of the Company
Stock Plan,  any Parent  Common  Stock issued upon  exercise of a Company  Stock
Option prior to  effectiveness  of such  registration  statement  shall bear the
legend set forth in Section 1.6(b).

     Section 5.5 Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Pooling of Interests. (a) Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the

<PAGE>

parties agrees to use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions,  and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing,  all things  necessary,  proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective,  in the most expeditious manner practicable,  the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, but
not  limited to using  commercially  reasonable  efforts for the purpose of: (i)
obtaining all necessary actions or non-actions,  waivers, consents and approvals
from all  Governmental  Entities  and making  all  necessary  registrations  and
filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and taking all reasonable
steps as may be necessary  to obtain an approval or waiver from,  or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental  Entity (including those in connection
with the HSR Act, the Bank Act and State Takeover  Approvals),  (iii)  obtaining
all necessary  consents,  approvals or waivers from third parties,  (iv) taking,
together with their respective accountants,  all actions reasonably necessary in
order to obtain a favorable  determination  (if required)  from the SEC that the
Merger may be accounted for as a pooling of interests in  accordance  with GAAP,
and (v)  executing  and  delivering  any  additional  instruments  necessary  to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (b) Each party shall
use all commercially  reasonable  efforts to not take any action,  or enter into
any  transaction,  which would cause any of its  representations  or  warranties
contained  in this  Agreement to be untrue or result in a breach of any covenant
made by it in this  Agreement.  (c)  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary
contained in this Agreement  (including  without  limitation  this Section 5.5),
Parent shall have no obligation to oppose,  challenge or appeal any suit, action
or  proceeding  by any  Governmental  Entity  before  any court or  governmental
authority,  agency or  tribunal,  domestic or foreign (i) seeking to restrain or
prohibit or restraining or prohibiting the  consummation of the Merger or any of
the other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) seeking to prohibit
or limit or seeking to apply conditions on or prohibiting,  limiting or imposing
conditions on the ownership,  operation or control by the Company, Parent or any
of their  respective  Subsidiaries  of any  portion  of the  business  or assets
(including  without  limitation any agreement) of the Company,  Parent or any of
their respective  Subsidiaries or that otherwise would have,  individually or in
the  aggregate,  an  adverse  effect  on  Parent,  the  Company  or any of their
respective  Subsidiaries,  or (iii) seeking to compel or compelling the Company,
Parent or any of their  respective  Subsidiaries  to dispose of, grant rights in
respect of, or hold  separate any portion of the  business or assets  (including
without  limitation  any  agreement)  of the  Company,  Parent  or any of  their
respective  Subsidiaries.  Parent shall have no obligation to commence any suit,
action or proceeding in any court or before any governmental  authority,  agency

<PAGE>

or  tribunal,   domestic  or  foreign,   in  connection  with  the  transactions
contemplated  by  this  Agreement.  Further,  notwithstanding  anything  to  the
contrary contained in this Agreement, (including without limitation this Section
5.5),  Parent shall have no obligation (i) to dispose of, hold separate or grant
any rights in respect  of, any  portion  of the  business  or assets  (including
without  limitation  any  agreement)  of the  Company,  Parent  or any of  their
respective Subsidiaries,  or (ii) to agree to any limitations or conditions with
respect to any portion of the business or assets (including  without  limitation
any agreement) of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries if
such limitations or conditions, either alone or together with any other factors,
in the good faith opinion of Parent, would have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company,  Parent or any of their  respective  Subsidiaries or would detract from
the value of the Merger to Parent in any  material  manner.  Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall take any of the actions described in preceding
sentences of this Section  5.5(c)  without the prior written  consent of Parent.
(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.5, shall limit or restrict Parent or any
of its  Subsidiaries  from entering into or effecting any agreement  relating to
any other  business  combination,  acquisition  or merger  and no such  business
combination,  acquisition or merger shall be deemed to violate this Section 5.5;
provided,  however, that this Section 5.5(d) is not intended to permit Parent to
make any acquisition,  by means of merger or otherwise, of assets or securities,
in each case,  which could reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
obtaining the consents or approvals of any  Governmental  Entity  required under
this Agreement.

     Section 5.6 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company will not issue any
press release with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise issue any written public  statements with respect to such transactions
without prior  consultation  with the other party,  except as may be required by
applicable  law or by  obligations  pursuant to any listing  agreement  with any
national securities exchange or the rules of Nasdaq.

     Section  5.7 Real  Estate  Transfer  and Gains Tax.  Parent and the Company
agree that either the Company or the Surviving Corporation will pay any state or
local tax which is attributable  to the transfer of the beneficial  ownership of
the Company's or its  Subsidiaries'  real property,  if any  (collectively,  the
"Gains  Taxes"),  and any penalties or interest with respect to the Gains Taxes,
payable in  connection  with the  consummation  of the  Merger.  The Company and
Parent  agree to  cooperate  with the other in the  filing of any  returns  with
respect to the Gains Taxes,  including  supplying in a timely  manner a complete

<PAGE>

list of all real property interests held by the Company and its Subsidiaries and
any  information  with respect to such property that is reasonably  necessary to
complete such returns.  The portion of the  consideration  allocable to the real
property of the Company and its  Subsidiaries  shall be  determined by Parent in
its reasonable discretion.

     Section 5.8 Transfer Tax Filings. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in
the   preparation,   execution  and  filing  of  all  returns,   questionnaires,
applications or other documents  regarding any real property  transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer,
recording,  registration and other fees or any similar taxes ("Transfer  Taxes")
which become payable in connection  with the  transactions  contemplated  by the
Agreement  that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective
Time.

     Section  5.9 Other  Transfer  Taxes.  Parent  and  Company  agree  that all
Transfer  Taxes  incurred by Parent,  Sub or the Company in connection  with the
Merger  arising on or after the  Effective  Time shall be borne by the Surviving
Corporation and shall not be reimbursed directly or indirectly by Parent.

     Section  5.10  State  Takeover   Laws.  If  any  "fair  price,"   "business
combination" or "control share acquisition"  statute or other similar statute or
regulation shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or in
the Company  Ancillary  Agreements,  Parent and the Company and their respective
Boards of Directors  shall use their  commercially  reasonable  efforts to grant
such  approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the  transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms  contemplated  hereby and thereby and  otherwise  act to minimize  the
effects  of any such  statute or  regulation  on the  transactions  contemplated
hereby and thereby.

     Section 5.11 Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance. (a) For six
years after the  Effective  Time,  Parent  shall,  and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation  to,  indemnify  and hold  harmless all past and present  directors,
officers,  employees or agents of the Company and of its  Subsidiaries  (each an
"Indemnified  Party")  to the full  extent  permitted  by law,  any  outstanding
indemnification  agreements listed in Section 5.11 of the Company Letter and the
Company  Charter or the Company Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof,  in each
case for all acts or omissions  occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, and
shall periodically  advance litigation expenses reasonably incurred by each such

<PAGE>

person in connection with defending any claim,  action or investigation  arising
out  of  such  acts  or  omissions   (including  the  reasonable   cost  of  any
investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject to such
person  providing an  undertaking  to  reimburse  all amounts so advanced in the
event  of  a  final  non-appealable   determination  by  a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction that such person is not entitled thereto.  Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate period of not
less than six years from the Effective  Time,  the Company's  current and former
directors  and officers an insurance  and  indemnification  policy that provides
coverage for events  existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "D&O
Insurance") that is no less favorable with respect to its limits and deductibles
than the Company's  existing policy or, if  substantially  equivalent  insurance
coverage is unavailable,  the best available coverage;  provided,  however, that
the Parent and  Surviving  Corporation  shall not be  required  to pay an annual
premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 150% of the last annual  premium paid
by the Company prior to the date hereof, but in such case shall purchase as much
coverage  as possible  for such  amount.  (b) In the event  Parent or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates  with or merges into any other Person and
is not the continuing or surviving  corporation or entity of such  consolidation
or merger or (ii) conveys all or substantially  all of its properties and assets
to any Person then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors  and  assigns  of Parent  assume  the  obligations  set forth in this
Section 5.11.

     Section  5.12  Notification  of  Certain  Matters.  Parent  shall  use  its
commercially  reasonable  efforts to give prompt notice to the Company,  and the
Company shall use its commercially  reasonable  efforts to give prompt notice to
Parent, of: (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence,  of any event the occurrence,
or non-occurrence,  of which it is aware and which would be reasonably likely to
cause (x) any  representation  or warranty  contained  in this  Agreement  to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material  respect or (y) any covenant,  condition or
agreement  contained in this  Agreement  not to be complied with or satisfied in
all material  respects,  (ii) any failure of Parent or the Company,  as the case
may be, to comply in a timely manner with or satisfy any covenant,  condition or
agreement to be complied  with or satisfied by it  hereunder.  The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to give prompt notice to Parent of any change or
event which would be reasonably  likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.  The  delivery of any notice  pursuant to this  Section  5.12 shall not
limit  or  otherwise  affect  the  remedies  available  hereunder  to the  party
receiving such notice.
<PAGE>

     Section 5.13  Compliance  with the Securities  Act. (a) Section 5.13 of the
Company  Letter  contains a list  identifying  all Persons who, at the effective
time of the Stockholder Consent, may be deemed to be "affiliates" of the Company
as that term is used in paragraphs  (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities
Act, other than directors of the Company who do not own any Company Common Stock
or Company Stock Options (the "Rule 145 Affiliates").  The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Person who is identified as a Rule
145  Affiliate  in such list to execute and deliver to Parent  within 30 days of
the date  hereof a written  agreement  in  substantially  the form of  Exhibit B
hereto  (the  "Company  Affiliate  Letter").  Prior to the  Effective  Time,  if
required,  the Company  shall amend and  supplement  Section 5.13 of the Company
Letter and use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to cause each  additional
Person who is  identified  as a Rule 145  Affiliate  of the Company to execute a
Company Affiliate Letter.  Parent shall be entitled to place appropriate legends
on the  certificates  evidencing  any  Parent  Common  Stock to be  received  by
affiliates of the Company  pursuant to this  Agreement and to issue  appropriate
stop transfer  instructions  to the transfer  agent for the Parent Common Stock,
consistent with the terms of the Company Affiliate  Letter.  (b) Section 5.13 of
the Parent Letter contains a list  identifying  those Persons who may be, at the
effective time of the Stockholder Consent, affiliates of Parent under applicable
SEC  accounting  releases  with  respect  to  pooling  of  interests  accounting
treatment.  Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a
written  agreement  in  substantially  the form of Exhibit C hereto (the "Parent
Affiliate  Letter")  within 30 days of the date hereof with each of such Persons
identified in the  foregoing  list.  Prior to the  Effective  Time, if required,
Parent shall amend and supplement  Section 5.13 of the Parent Letter and use its
reasonable  best  efforts to cause  each  additional  Person  who is  identified
therein as an affiliate of Parent to execute the Parent Affiliate Letter.

     Section 5.14 Registration  Rights Agreement.  Parent agrees to enter into a
Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), in the form
of the attached  Exhibit D, with each of the  stockholders of the Company who or
which elects to become a party thereto by giving Parent  written  notice to such
effect no later than 60 days after the date hereof.

     Section 5.15 Employee  Matters.  To the extent any Parent Plan (or any plan
of the Surviving Corporation) shall be made applicable to any employee or former
employee of the Company,  Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, grant to employees  and former  employees of the Company  credit for service

<PAGE>

with the Company and its  Subsidiaries  (or service  credited by the Company and
its Subsidiaries) for the purposes of determining  eligibility to participate in
such plan and the employee's  nonforfeitable interest in benefits thereunder and
for purposes of  calculating  benefits  thereunder  (but  subject to offset,  if
necessary,  to avoid duplication of benefits).  Parent shall (i) waive (or cause
to be waived) any pre-existing  condition limitations that might otherwise apply
to employees or former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries  unless not
waived under the Company's  equivalent  plan and (ii)  recognize (or cause to be
recognized)  the dollar  amount of all expenses  incurred by employees or former
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries  during the calendar year in which
the  Effective  Time  occurs  for  purposes  of  satisfying  the  calendar  year
deductions and co-payment  limitations for such year, under the relevant welfare
benefit plans of Parent or the Surviving Corporation.  Nothing in this Agreement
shall be interpreted as limiting the power of the Surviving Corporation to amend
or  terminate  any Company Plan or any other  employee  benefit  plan,  program,
agreement or policy in  accordance  with its terms or as requiring the Surviving
Corporation  or Parent to offer or to  continue  (other  than as required by its
terms) any written employment contract.

     Section 5.16  Advisory  Committee.  (a) Except as otherwise  limited by any
applicable  law,  regulation,  rule,  ordinance,  judgment,  order or  decree or
otherwise  required by any Government Entity,  Parent will establish,  following
the  Closing,  a  Network  Advisory  Board  (the  "Advisory  Board")  of  senior
executives  of financial  institution  members of the MAC(r) and Star  System(r)
Networks  (collectively,  the "Network").  The selection and terms of service of
the members of the  Advisory  Board shall be at Parent's  sole  discretion.  The
Advisory  Board shall expire on December  31, 2010.  (b) Parent shall give prior
written  notice to the Advisory  Board of changes  proposed by Parent to (i) the
operating rules governing the Network from any combination of the MAC(r) Network
Rules and Regulations and the Star Systems, Inc. Operating Rules existing on the
Closing  Date or (ii) the  external  interchange  rates  and fees  (ATM and POS)
payable between, or passed through to, Network participants. The Advisory Board,
by a majority  vote of the entire  Advisory  Board,  may veto any such  proposed
change prior to the effective date of such proposed  change.  The Advisory Board
also may propose changes to Network operating rules and pricing,  which shall be
considered by Parent in its sole discretion. (c) If, after the Closing Date, the
Network offers new products or services  under the Network  brand,  Parent shall
give  prior  written  notice  to the  Advisory  Board  of the  establishment  or
modification  of the  pricing of  transactions  for such  products  or  services
between  Network  participants.  The Advisory  Board,  by a majority vote of the

<PAGE>

entire Advisory Board, may veto any such proposed pricing prior to the effective
date of such proposed change. (d) Parent shall retain sole authority to set fees
payable  to any  legal  entity  operating  the  Network.  (e)  Parent  considers
point-to-point transfers,  electronic check services and Internet debit services
to be significant strategic initiatives for the Network and will make reasonable
efforts to develop and support such transactions.

     Section 5.17  Directorship.  At the first meeting of the Board of Directors
of Parent following the Effective Time,  Parent's Board of Directors shall elect
Ronald V. Congemi to be a director of Parent so that immediately thereafter, the
Board of Directors of Parent shall consist of ten directors.

Subsidiaries,  shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,  enforced or entered any

(whether  temporary,  preliminary or permanent)  which is then in effect and has
the effect of making the Merger or any of the transactions  contemplated  hereby
illegal.  (d) Accounting.  The Company shall have received the written  opinion,

Effective  Time, of Ernst & Young LLP that Parent is eligible to be a party to a
business combination  accounted for as a pooling of interests in accordance with

Merger will  qualify for pooling of interests  accounting.  Each of such written

<PAGE>

opinions will be in form and substance  reasonably  satisfactory  to the Parent.
(e)  Certain  Governmental  Consents.  All  authorizations,   consents,  orders,
declarations or approvals of, or filings with, or terminations or expirations of
waiting  periods  imposed  by, any  Governmental  Entity,  which the  failure to

been obtained, shall have been made or shall have occurred.

substantially  to the  effect  that on the basis of facts,  representations  and
assumptions  set forth in such opinion  which are  consistent  with the state of
facts  existing as of the Effective  Time,  for United States federal income tax
purposes,  the Merger will constitute a  "reorganization"  within the meaning of

its Subsidiaries,  shall have been obtained,  shall have been made or shall have

     Section 7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior

presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company:  (a)
by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company; (b) by either Parent or the
Company if the other party shall have failed to comply in any  material  respect
with any of its covenants or agreements  contained in this Agreement required to

has not been cured  within 30 days  following  receipt  by such  other  party of
written notice from the  non-breaching  party of such failure to comply;  (c) by
either  Parent or the  Company if there has been (i) a breach by the other party
(in the case of Parent,  including any breach by Sub) of any  representation  or
warranty that is not qualified as to materiality  which has the effect of making
such representation or warranty not true and correct in all material respects or
(ii) a breach by the other party (in the case of Parent, including any breach by
Sub) of any  representation or warranty that is qualified as to materiality,  in
each case which  breach has not been cured within 30 days  following  receipt by

either party may by written  notice to the other party  delivered on or prior to
June 30,  2001 extend such date until the day  immediately  preceding  the first
anniversary  hereof if the  failure of the Merger to be  effected on or prior to
June 30, 2001 shall have resulted from the failure of the condition set forth in
Section 6.1(b);  provided,  further,  that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this  Section  7.1(d)(i)  shall not be  available to any party whose

<PAGE>

failure to fulfill any of its  obligations  contained in this Agreement has been
the cause of, or resulted  in, the failure of the Merger to have  occurred on or
prior to the  aforesaid  date;  or (ii) any court or other  Governmental  Entity
having  jurisdiction  over a party hereto shall have issued an order,  decree or
ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise
prohibiting  the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement and such order,
decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; (e) by
Parent  if the  stockholders  of the  Company  do not  approve  and  adopt  this
Agreement  in an action by written  consent no later than 45 days after the date
hereof;  (f) by Parent if (i) the Board of  Directors  of the Company  shall not
have  recommended,  or shall  have  resolved  not to  recommend,  or shall  have
qualified, modified or withdrawn its recommendation of the Merger or declaration
that the Merger is advisable and fair to and in the best interest of the Company
and its  stockholders,  or shall have  resolved to do so, (ii) any Person (other
than Parent or its Affiliates)  acquires or becomes the beneficial  owner of 10%

result of a bona fide change of control of existing stockholders of the Company,
all of whom  are  parties  to a  Stockholder  Agreement),  (iii)  the  Board  of
Directors  of the Company  shall have  recommended  to the  stockholders  of the
Company any Takeover  Proposal or shall have  resolved to do so or (iv) a tender
offer or  exchange  offer for 10% or more of the  outstanding  shares of capital
stock of the Company is  commenced,  and the Board of  Directors  of the Company
fails to recommend against  acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by
its stockholders (including by taking no position with respect to the acceptance
of such tender offer or exchange offer by its stockholders); (g) by the Company,
upon  written  notice to Parent,  at any time during the five trading day period
after the Determination Date, if both of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) the  Parent  Average  Price on the  Determination  Date  shall be less  than
$24.25;  and (2) (i) the number obtained by dividing the Parent Average Price on
the  Determination  Date by 30.3125 (such number being referred to herein as the
"Parent  Ratio") shall be less than (ii) the average of the Index Company Ratios
less 0.15 (such number being referred to herein as the "Index Ratio");  subject,
however,  to the following  provisions.  The Company may withdraw such notice of
termination  at any time  within the  aforementioned  five  trading  day period.
During the five trading day period  commencing  with its receipt of such notice,
Parent shall have the option to elect to increase  the  Exchange  Ratio to equal
the lesser of (i) the number  obtained by dividing (1) 24.25  multiplied  by the
Exchange  Ratio  (as then in  effect)  by (2) the  Parent  Average  Price on the
Determination  Date, and (ii) the number obtained by dividing (1) the product of
the Index  Ratio and the  Exchange  Ratio (as then in  effect) by (2) the Parent

<PAGE>

Ratio.  Any election by Parent pursuant to the preceding  sentence shall be made
by delivery  of a written  notice to the  Company  within such five  trading day
period and shall  specify  the revised  Exchange  Ratio.  Upon  delivery of such
notice by Parent,  no termination  shall be deemed to have occurred  pursuant to
this Section 7.1(g) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with
its terms (except as the Exchange  Ratio shall have been so  modified),  and any
references in this Agreement to "Exchange  Ratio" shall  thereafter be deemed to
refer to the  Exchange  Ratio  as  adjusted  pursuant  to this  Section  7.1(g).
Promptly  after Parent gives notice of its election to adjust the Exchange Ratio
hereunder,  Parent and the Company  shall agree on a date to be the Closing Date
under this Agreement, which date shall be not more than five business days after
the date of  delivery  of such notice by Parent.  For  purposes of this  Section

transaction  reporting  system for the market or  exchange  on which such common

such Reporting System of shares of such company's common stock for all such days
during the  Calculation  Period.  "Index  Company  Ratios" shall mean,  for each
company  included in the Index Group,  the number obtained by dividing the Index

7.1 of the Parent  Letter,  those  companies  the common stock of which shall be

transactions with a value exceeding 25% of the acquiror's market  capitalization
as of the Starting Date.  "Parent Average Price" on a given date shall equal the
quotient  (calculated  to the nearest  hundredth) of (i) the sum for all trading
days  during the  Calculation  Period of (x) the average of the high and the low
sales price as reported on Nasdaq of a share of Parent Common Stock on each such
day,  multiplied  by (y) the  trading  volume as reported on Nasdaq of shares of

volumes as reported on Nasdaq of shares of Parent Common Stock for all such days
during the Calculation Period.  "Starting Date" shall mean the tenth trading day
prior to the date of this Agreement.  If Parent or any company  belonging to the
Index   Group   declares   or  effects  a  stock   dividend,   reclassification,

the  Determination  Date,  the prices for the  common  stock of such  company or
Parent and the other  numbers set forth above in this  Section  7.1(g)  shall be
appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this Section 7.1(g); and (h)

(iv) seeks to compel or compels the Company,  Parent or any of their  respective
Subsidiaries  to dispose of,  grant  rights in respect of, or hold  separate any

amendment  shall  be  made  which  by law  requires  further  approval  by  such
stockholders  without such further  approval.  This Agreement may not be amended
except by an  instrument  in  writing  signed  on behalf of each of the  parties
hereto.

due  authorization,  execution  and delivery of this  Agreement by Parent,  this
Agreement  constitutes  the  valid  and  binding  agreement  of the  Stockholder
enforceable  against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except as may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,  moratorium and
other similar laws of general  application  which may affect the  enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by general equitable  principles.  The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Stockholder does not and will not conflict
with any agreement, order or other instrument binding upon the Stockholder,  nor
require the Stockholder to make or obtain any regulatory filing or approval. (c)
Each of the representations and warrants contained in Section 3.31 of the Merger
Agreement  is true and correct  with respect to the  Stockholder.  4.  Affiliate
Letter.  The  Stockholder  agrees to execute  and  deliver on a timely  basis an
Affiliate Letter in the form of Exhibit B to the Merger  Agreement,  when and if
requested  by  Parent.  5.  Termination.  The  obligations  of  the  Stockholder
hereunder  shall  terminate  upon the earlier of the  termination  of the Merger
Agreement  pursuant to Section 7.1 thereof or the Effective Time;  provided that
in the event the Merger  Agreement is terminated  pursuant to Section  7.1(e) or
7.1(f) thereof, the obligations of the Stockholder hereunder shall terminate six
months after the termination of the Merger Agreement.  No such termination shall
relieve the  Stockholder  from any liability in connection  with this  Agreement
incurred prior to such termination. 6. Further Assurances. The Stockholder will,
from time to time,  execute and deliver,  or cause to be executed and delivered,
such additional or further  consents,  documents and other instruments as Parent
may  reasonably  request  for  the  purpose  of  effectively  carrying  out  the
transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement.  7.  Successors,   Assigns  and
Transferees Bound. Any successor, assignee or transferee (including a successor,
assignee or transferee as a result of the death of the  Stockholder,  such as an
executor or heir) shall be bound by the terms hereof,  and the Stockholder shall
take any and all actions reasonably necessary to obtain the written confirmation
from  such  successor,  assignee  or  transferee  that it is bound by the  terms
hereof.  8. Remedies.  The Stockholder  acknowledges that money damages would be
both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by
it, and that any such breach would cause Parent  irreparable harm.  Accordingly,
the Stockholder  agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened  breach of
this Agreement, Parent, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity it
may have, shall be entitled,  without the requirement of posting a bond or other

security,  to  equitable  relief,   including  injunctive  relief  and  specific
performance.  9.  Severability.   The  invalidity  or  unenforceability  of  any
provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement in such jurisdiction, or
the validity or  enforceability  of any provision of this Agreement in any other
jurisdiction.  If in the good-faith opinion of Parent's independent accountants,
any  provision  hereof would cause the Merger to be  ineligible  for "pooling of
interest"  accounting  treatment,  it  shall be  deemed  to be  ineffective  and
inapplicable.  10.  Amendment.  This Agreement may be amended only by means of a
written  instrument  executed and delivered by both the  Stockholder and Parent.
11.  Governing  Law.  This  Agreement  shall be governed  by, and  construed  in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware,  regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
12. Submission to Jurisdiction.  Each party hereto hereby irrevocably submits in
any suit,  action or proceeding  arising out of or related to this  Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of the United  States in Delaware and the  jurisdiction  of the courts of
the State of Delaware and waives any and all objections to jurisdiction  that it
may have under the laws of the State of  Delaware  or the United  States and any
claim or objection that any such court is an inconvenient forum. 13. Capitalized
Terms.  Capitalized  terms used in this  Agreement  that are not defined  herein
shall have such meanings as set forth in the Merger Agreement. 14. Counterparts.
For  the  convenience  of  the  parties,  this  Agreement  may  be  executed  in
counterparts,  each of  which  shall be  deemed  an  original,  but all of which
together  shall  constitute  one and the same  instrument.  15. No Limitation on
Actions of the  Stockholder  as Director.  In the event the  Stockholder  or its
designee is a director of the Company,  notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this  Agreement,  nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed
to require  the  Stockholder  or such  designee  to take or in any way limit any
action  that  the  Stockholder  or  such  designee  may  take to  discharge  the
Stockholder's or such designee's fiduciary duties as a director of the Company.
