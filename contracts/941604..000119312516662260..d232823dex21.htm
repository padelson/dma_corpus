material correspondence between the SEC and the Company since December 31,
2013 that is not set forth in the Company SEC Reports or included on the SECs
EDGAR website or that has not otherwise been disclosed to Parent prior to the
date hereof. No Subsidiary of the Company is subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act or is otherwise required to file any periodic

Section 3.10 _Financial Statements; Internal Controls_.

 

(a) The consolidated financial statements of the Company (including any
related notes thereto) included or incorporated by reference in the Company
SEC Reports:

(i) as of their respective filing dates with the SEC (or, if such Company SEC
Reports were amended prior to the date of this Agreement, the date of the
filing of such amendment, with respect to the consolidated financial
statements that are amended or restated therein), complied as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the rules and
regulations of the SEC;

(ii) were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis (except as
may be indicated in the notes to those financial statements, as permitted by
Regulation S-X or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form
10-Q under the Exchange Act, and except that the unaudited statements may not
contain certain footnotes and are subject to normal, recurring audit
adjustments); and

 

(iii) fairly presented (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and
subject in the case of unaudited statements to normal, recurring year-end
audit adjustments) in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income, cash flows and stockholders equity for the periods indicated.

(b) Since December 31, 2013, there has been no material change in
the Companys accounting methods or principles that would be required to be
disclosed in the Companys financial statements in accordance with GAAP,
except as described in the notes thereto.

 

(c) Since December 31, 2013, neither the Company nor any Representative of the
Company has received any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
regarding deficiencies in the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls.

 



23 (d) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and a system of internal control over financial reporting (within
the meaning of Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act) required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the Companys periodic reports under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods,
and that all such information is communicated to the individuals responsible
for the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Since December 31, 2013, neither the
Company nor the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, has
identified (i) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys or any of
its Subsidiaries ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information in any material respect and (ii) any fraud or allegation of fraud,
whether or not material, that involves (or involved) management or other
employees who have (or had) a significant role in the Companys internal
controls. The Company is, and has been since December 31, 2013, in compliance
in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market. Neither the Company nor any of its

credit" to directors or executive officers of the Company prohibited by
Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

Section 3.11 _Liabilities_.

of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP, other than:

Section 3.13 _Litigation_. There are no legal actions, arbitrations,
mediations, litigations, suits, claims, investigations, or other civil or
criminal proceedings (collectively, " _Legal Actions_ ") pending or, to the

Subsidiaries or any Company Asset that would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. There are no Orders outstanding against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Company Assets that would, individually or in the

and conditions therein, for debt financing in the amounts set forth therein
(being collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ " and,
together with the Equity Financing, collectively referred to as the "
_Financing_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Financing
Letters has been amended or modified, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no such
amendment or modification is contemplated, and, to the Knowledge of Parent,
none of the respective obligations and commitments contained in such letters
have been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect and, to the

contemplated. Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub or Redbox Merger Sub has fully paid
any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Financing
Letters that are payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement and will
continue to pay in full any such amounts required to be paid pursuant to the
terms of the Financing Letters as and when they become due and payable on or
prior to the Closing Date. Assuming (i) the Financing is funded in accordance
with the Financing Letters, (ii) the accuracy in all material respects of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.8, Section 3.10(a),
Section 3.11, Section 3.12(c) (as it relates to Section 5.1(c)), Section

this Agreement, the net proceeds contemplated by the Financing Letters (after
netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar
premiums and charges and after giving effect to the maximum amount of flex
(including original issue discount flex) provided under the Debt Commitment
Letters), together with any available cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries

other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions (including all amounts payable in respect of Company Stock
Options and Company Awards under this Agreement) and to pay all related fees
and expenses payable by them in connection with the Transactions (such amount
collectively, the " _Required Amount_ "). The Financing Letters are (x)
legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub and

or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub or Redbox Merger Sub or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto under the Equity Funding Letter
or the Debt Commitment Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parents, Outerwall Merger Subs
and Redbox Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Offer and the Mergers,
Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub and Redbox Merger Sub do not have any reason to
believe that the conditions precedent set forth in the Financing Letters will
not be satisfied or that the Required Amount will not be available on the
Closing Date. The only conditions precedent (including the market "flex"
provisions) related to the obligations of the Guarantors to fund the full
amount of the Equity Financing and the lenders to fund the full amount of the
Debt Financing are those set forth in the Equity Funding Letter and the Debt
Commitment Letters, respectively. As of the date of this Agreement, there are
no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements (except for the portions
of the Redacted Fee Letter permitted to be redacted hereunder) to which Parent
or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the Financing other than as
contained in the Financing Letters delivered to the Company prior to the date
of this Agreement that would (A) impair the enforceability of any of the
Financing Letters, (B) reduce the aggregate amount of any portion of the
Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount as compared to the fees and original issue discount
contemplated by the Financing Letters on the date of this Agreement) such that
the aggregate amount of the Financing would be below the amount required to
pay the Required Amount, (C) impose new or additional conditions precedent to
the Financing, (D) otherwise adversely modify any of the conditions precedent
to the Financing or (E) reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or delay
the consummation of the Financing.

Section 4.8 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,

any of its Subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall require the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to provide such access or information to the extent the
Company determines, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
outside counsel), that such action (A) would reasonably be expected to result
in a waiver of attorney-client privilege, work-product doctrine or similar

the Company or applicable Subsidiary will enter into a joint defense agreement
with Parent if requested with respect to any such information), (B) would
reasonably be expected to violate any applicable Law or any confidentiality
obligation pursuant to any binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or
owing to a third party ( _provided_ that the Company shall have used
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to provide
such information, if requested), or (C) specifically relates to the
evaluation, deliberation or minutes of the Company Board (or any committee or
subcommittee thereof) related to the Transactions, the strategic and financial
alternatives process leading thereto, or any information or materials

this Agreement shall be governed under the terms and conditions of the letter
agreement regarding confidentiality, dated April 1, 2016, between the Company
and Apollo Management VIII, L.P., including any amendment or addendum thereto
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). The Company agrees that it will treat
any documents and information concerning the Parent Associated Parties

their respective Representatives in connection with the Transactions as if it
was " _Confidential Information_ " under the Confidentiality Agreement and as
if the use and disclosure restrictions thereunder applied to the Company. 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, rights to control or direct the operations of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time. Before the Effective Time, the
Company shall, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
exercise complete control and supervision over the operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries.

Section 5.4 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) From and after the date hereof until the Offer Acceptance Time or, if

its reasonable best efforts to cause its

indirectly (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage any
inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes,
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter
into, continue, knowingly encourage or facilitate or otherwise participate in
any discussions with, or furnish any non-public information with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Person in connection with a
Takeover Proposal (other than to state that the Company is not permitted to
have discussions), (iii) execute or enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle or Contract with respect to a Takeover Proposal (other

modify or fail to enforce any provision of any "standstill" or
similar obligation of any person (other than Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub and
Redbox Merger Sub) with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
except solely to the extent necessary to allow for a confidential Takeover
Proposal to be made to the Company Board. The Company shall, shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations (including
electronic data room access) with any Person (other than Parent, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives) conducted prior to the date
of this Agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall
promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days hereof) deliver a
written notice to each such Person to the effect that the Company is ending
all such solicitations, communications, activities, discussions or
negotiations with such Person, effective on the date hereof, which written
notice shall also request that each Person promptly return or destroy all non-
public information previously furnished to such Person or any of its
Representatives by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

the restrictions or obligations set forth in this Section 5.4 by any
Subsidiary of the Company, or by any Representative of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries acting on behalf of or at the direction of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of Section 5.4 by the
Company.

 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a) or any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, at any time after the date hereof until the Offer Acceptance
Time, and following the receipt by the Company of a Takeover Proposal that did
not result from a breach of Section 5.4(a), (i) the Company and its
Representatives shall be permitted to contact the Person making such Takeover
Proposal solely to the extent necessary to clarify the terms of such Takeover
Proposal and (ii) if the Company Board determines in good faith (A) that such
Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to
a Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that the failure to take the actions set forth in clauses
(x) and (y) below with respect to such Takeover Proposal would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company
may, in response to such Takeover Proposal, (x) furnish access and information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries to the Person who has made such Takeover Proposal, and its
Representatives, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, so long
as any material non-public information provided or made available under this
clause (x) has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and
(y) participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such Takeover
Proposal.

the Company shall advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) the receipt of
any Takeover Proposal or any bona fide proposal, request (including

expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, specifying the material terms and
conditions thereof and the identity of the party making such Takeover Proposal
and including a copy of the Takeover Proposal, proposal, request or inquiry,
as applicable, and copies of all material communications and proposed
transaction documents received in connection therewith, and (ii) any material
modifications to the financial or other material terms and conditions of such
Takeover Proposal, in each case as soon as is reasonably practicable and
in any event within twenty four (24) hours of the Companys receipt thereof
and with copies of any written correspondence to or from any Person making any
such Takeover Proposal or bona fide proposal, request or inquiry, as
applicable.

 

(d) Except as set forth in Section 5.4(e), Section 5.4(f) and Section 5.4(g),
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall not (i) withdraw, modify or
amend, or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or amend, the Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose, or
announce an intention, to approve, endorse or recommend, a Takeover Proposal,
(iii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9
or, if any Takeover Proposal has been made public, fail to reaffirm the
Company Board Recommendation upon request of Parent within the earlier
of three (3) Business Days prior to the then-scheduled Expiration Time or ten
(10) Business Days after Parent requests such reaffirmation with respect to a
Takeover Proposal ( _provided_ that, if any such request is made within
three (3) Business Days of the then-scheduled Expiration Time, as promptly as
practicable; and _provided_ , _further_ that Parent may make such request only
once with respect to such Takeover Proposal unless such Takeover Proposal
is subsequently modified in any material respect, in which case Parent may
make one (1) such request to reaffirm each time such a modification is made)
(any action described in clauses (i) through (iii) being referred to as an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (iv) approve, recommend or allow the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or Contract relating to
a Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (an
" _Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(e) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(d) or any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company Board may, at any time before the Offer
Acceptance Time and in response to a Superior Proposal received by the Company
Board after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of
this Section 5.4 (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) validly
terminate this Agreement to enter into an Acquisition Agreement in accordance
with Section 7.4(a) or authorize, resolve, agree or propose publicly to take
any such action, but only if:

(i) the Company has not breached any of its obligations under this Section
5.4, other than _de minimis_ breaches;

 



52 (ii) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

(iii) the Company shall have first provided at least three (3) Business Days
prior written notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to Parent that the Company is
prepared to (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (y)
validly terminate this Agreement to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall include the material terms
and conditions of the transaction (including a copy of the Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, if available) that constitutes such Superior Proposal
and the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal;

(iv) during the Notice Period, the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, with Parent and its Representatives in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to
propose in writing such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the
Transaction Documents so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal; and

(v) following the end of the Notice Period (it being understood that any
material change to the financial or other terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal shall require an additional notice to Parent and a new two
(2) Business Day period), and after considering such negotiations and any
adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Transaction Documents that have
been agreed to in writing by Parent, the Company Board has determined in good
faith that, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.

(f) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(d) or any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company Board may, at any time before the Offer
Acceptance Time, make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event, but only if:

 

(i) the Company has not breached any of its obligations under this Section
5.4, other than _de minimis_ breaches;

 

(ii) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

(iii) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent
for at least the duration of the Notice Period that the Company is prepared to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change, which notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the Intervening Event and the basis therefor;

 



53 (iv) during the Notice Period, the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel to negotiate, with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to
propose in writing such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the
Transaction Documents so that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation
Change would no longer be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

 

(v) following the end of the Notice Period (it being understood that any
material change with respect to the Intervening Event shall require an
additional notice to Parent and a new two (2) Business Day period), and after
considering such negotiations and any adjustments in the terms and conditions
of the Transaction Documents that have been agreed to in writing by Parent,
the Company Board has determined that, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, the failure to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change continues to be inconsistent with the directors
exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company, the
Company Board or any committee or subcommittee thereof from complying with
Rules 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or from making any required disclosure under applicable Law to
the Companys stockholders if the Company Board determines, in good faith
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or such
disclosure is otherwise required under applicable Law; _provided_ that any
such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) shall be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company
Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the issuance of a "stop, look and
listen" statement (or other similar statement of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) constitute an Adverse Recommendation
Change.

Section 5.5  _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

(a) As of the Effective Time and for a period of at least one year thereafter
(the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, provide
to each individual who, immediately prior to the Effective Time is an employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, an " _Employee_ ") (i) a salary or hourly wage rate substantially
comparable to that provided to such Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) incentive pay opportunities, including bonus and
commission opportunities, but not including equity, equity-based awards or any
change in control or retention bonuses, that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided to such Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (iii) other compensation and employee benefits (excluding
equity, equity-based awards or any change in control or retention bonuses,
which will remain discretionary) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate, determined on an

 



54  individual basis, to those provided to such Employee under the compensation
and employee benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements, arrangements and
practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
after the Effective Time, nothing herein shall preclude the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
from terminating the employment of any Employee at any time.

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, honor all Company Benefit Plans
(including all severance, change of control, retention and similar plans,
agreements and practices) in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or
termination thereof that may be permitted by the terms of such Company Benefit
Plans and except as provided herein; _provided_ , that, subject to Section
5.5(a) nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of any
Company Benefit Plan or other specific plan, program, policy, agreement,
arrangement or practice, or interfere with Parents, the Surviving
Corporations or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates rights
or obligations to make such changes as are necessary to comply with applicable
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) for the later of the duration of the
Continuation Period or the remaining term of any individual employment,
severance or separation agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, provide each Employee who suffers a
termination of employment under circumstances that would have given the
Employee a right to severance payments and benefits under the Companys or any
of the Companys Subsidiaries severance practice set forth on Section
5.5(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Severance Policy_
") or individual employment, severance or separation agreement or other
arrangement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with severance
payments and benefits no less favorable than those that would have been
provided to such Employee under the Company Severance Policy (as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time) or such individual agreement or other
arrangement, (ii) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, honor the Companys and any of
Companys Subsidiaries performance bonus plans set forth on Section
5.5(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule in accordance with their terms
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and consistent with the
Companys past practice (including with respect to timing of payment and
methods for determining achievement of performance measures), and (iii)
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, honor the Companys and any of Companys
Subsidiaries retention bonus program set forth on Section 5.5(b)(iii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule in accordance with its terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) For all purposes under all employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates providing
benefits to any Employee after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each
Employee shall receive full credit for such Employees years of service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time (including
predecessor or acquired entities or any

 



55  other entities for which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company
Benefit Plan has given credit for prior service), to the same extent as such
Employee was entitled, prior to the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan (except to the
extent such credit would result in a duplication of accrual of benefits). In
addition, where applicable, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing: (i) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause. at
the Effective Time, each Employee to be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in each New Plan to the extent such waiting time
was satisfied under a similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), (ii) Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and limitations, actively-at-work requirements and evidence-of-
insurability requirements of each New Plan to be waived or satisfied for such
Employee and his or her covered spouse, domestic partner and dependents to
the extent waived, satisfied or not applicable under the analogous Old Plan as
of the Effective Time and (iii) Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all eligible expenses incurred by each Employee and his or
her covered spouse, domestic partner and dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Employees participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

(d) With respect to any earned but unused paid time off or PTO time to which
any Employee is entitled pursuant to the PTO policy or individual agreement
or other arrangement applicable to such Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, (i) allow such Employee
to use such earned PTO and (ii) if any Employees employment terminates during
the Continuation Period under circumstances entitling the Employee to
severance pay under the Company Severance Policy, pay the Employee, in cash,
an amount equal to the value of the earned and unused PTO, in each case, to
the extent such amounts have been properly accrued by the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary.

 

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.5, whether express or implied, shall confer upon
any current or former employee or independent contractor of the Company,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, any rights or remedies including any right to employment or
continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind
whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.5. No provision of this
Section 5.5 is intended to modify, amend or create any employee benefit plan
of the Company, Parent, Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or, subject to the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.5, limit the ability of the Company, Parent, Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend or terminate
any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan or policy in
accordance with applicable Law and the terms of such Company Benefit Plan or
other benefit plan or a policy.

 



56 Section 5.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Related
Insurance_. 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, in each case, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless, and
advance expenses to, each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any
time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the Company or
of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively,
the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims, Liabilities, losses,
damages, judgments, fines, penalties, reasonable and documented
costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses
(including reasonable and documented fees and expenses of legal counsel) in
connection with any Legal Action (including as may be administrative or
investigative), whenever asserted based on or arising out of, in whole or in
part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or was acting in such capacity, or (B) acts
or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or taken at the request of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including in connection with serving
at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a representative of
another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under
clause (A) or (B) above, at, or at any time prior to the Effective Date
(including any Legal Action (including as may be administrative
or investigative) relating in whole or in part to the Transactions or
relating to enforcement of this provision) and (ii) assume all obligations of
the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of Liabilities for
acts or omissions at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the Company
Organizational Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in any
agreement in existence as of the date of this Agreement and set forth on
Section 5.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule providing indemnification
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
Indemnitee, on the other hand. Without limiting the foregoing, for a period
of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause, unless
otherwise required by Law, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the
Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors of the
Company and indemnification of directors and officers of the Company than are
set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company Organizational
Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
Indemnitees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.6(a),
any Person to whom an advancement of expenses is provided shall be required
to provide, as a condition to such advancement, an undertaking to repay the
amounts so advanced if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification for the Legal Action for which advancements have
been made.

(b) In the event of any Legal Action (including as may be administrative or
investigative) related to the acts or omissions covered under this Section
5.6 (each, a " _Claim_ ") (i) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with
the Indemnitee and its insurer in the defense of any such Claim and (ii)
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Surviving Corporation shall not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry

 



57  of any judgment in any Claim pending or threatened in writing to which an
Indemnitee is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could be sought
by such Indemnitee hereunder);  _provided_ , that the consent of the
Indemnitee shall not be required if such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all Liability
arising out of such Claim.

 

(c) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect
for at least six years after the Effective Time the current policies of
directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company on terms and scope with respect to coverage, and in
amount, no less favorable to its covered individuals than those of such
policies in effect on the date of this Agreement, or policies, issued by a
reputable insurer at least equivalent to the insurer(s) of the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance, of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous with respect to claims arising out
of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time
(including in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions) so long as Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, is not required to pay an annual premium in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such
insurance before the date of this Agreement (such 300% amount being the "
_Maximum Premium_ "). If Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, is unable to obtain the insurance described in the prior sentence for an
amount less than or equal to the Maximum Premium, then Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for
an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in lieu of the arrangements contemplated by this Section
5.6(c), before the Effective Time, the Company shall be entitled to purchase a
six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy providing no less favorable terms and
benefits as the current policies of directors and officers liability and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time covering,
without limitation, the Transactions; _provided_ , that in no event shall the
annual premium for any such "tail" policy exceed the Maximum Premium, and, if
such a "tail" policy has been obtained by the Company before the Effective
Time, then Parent and the Surviving Corporations obligations under this
Section 5.6(c) shall be satisfied.

(d) The covenants contained in this Section 5.6 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnitees and their
respective heirs and legal representatives and, following the Effective Time,
shall not be deemed exclusive of, or in substitution for, any other rights to
which an Indemnitee is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 5.6 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.6 applies
unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or
(y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that, following the
Effective Time, the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.6 applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.6).

 



58 (e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary action so that
the successors or assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.6.

(f) Any Indemnitee seeking to claim indemnification or an advancement of
expenses under this Agreement or otherwise, upon learning of any such Legal
Action, shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation of any
Liability it may have to such Indemnitee, except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the Surviving Corporation.

Section 5.7 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable Law,
each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to ensure that, as promptly as practicable, the Offer Conditions and
the conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied and to consummate the
Transactions as promptly as practicable, including by preparing and filing
promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications
and other documents. The terms of this Section 5.7 shall not limit the rights
of the Company set forth in Section 5.4.

Section 5.8 _Consents; Filings; Further Action_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with applicable Law, each of the parties to this Agreement shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
(i) obtain any consents, approvals, registrations, waivers, permits, orders or
other authorizations from, and make any filings and notifications with, any
Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions, (ii) make any other submissions necessary, proper
or advisable in connection with the Transactions under the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act, the HSR Act, the DGCL, the Nasdaq rules and regulations and
any other applicable Law and (iii) take or cause to be taken all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable consistent with this Section 5.8 to cause
the expiration of the applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required
consents, approvals or authorizations, as applicable, under such Laws as soon
as practicable. Parent and the Company shall cooperate and consult with each
other in connection with the making of all such filings and notifications,
including by providing copies of all relevant documents to the non-filing
party and its advisors before filing. Parent shall not consent to any
voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any
voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Authority without the consent of
the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

 



59 (b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and in any
event by no later than five (5) Business Days from the date of this
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall file and not withdraw any
Notification and Report Forms and related material required to be filed by it
with the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of
Justice, as applicable, with respect to the Transactions (which shall request
the early termination of any waiting period applicable to the Transactions
under the HSR Act), and shall promptly make any further filings pursuant
thereto that may be necessary, proper or advisable.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly inform the other party upon
receipt of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the Transactions. If Parent or the Company (or any of their respective
Affiliates) receives a request for additional information from any
Governmental Authority that is related to the Transactions, then such party
shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, to the extent
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate
response to such request as promptly as reasonably practicable. No party
shall participate in any meeting or engage in any material substantive
conversation with any Governmental Authority without giving the other party
prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by
such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. Parent
shall advise the Company promptly of any understandings, undertakings or
agreements (oral or written) which Parent proposes to make or enter into with
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted with
respect to the Transactions under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulatory Law, including the HSR Act, as promptly as practicable.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall
take all action necessary to avoid the entry or to effect the dissolution of,
or vacate or lift, any Order that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing, impairing or delaying the consummation of the Transactions, or to
resolve any objections as the Federal Trade Commission, the United States
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority may assert under any
Law with respect to the Transactions and to obtain any clearance required
under the HSR Act, or any other approval, consent or authorization necessary
under applicable Law for the consummation of the Transactions, including (i)
(A) selling, licensing, divesting or disposing of or holding separate any
entities, assets or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries), (B) terminating, amending or assigning existing relationships
or contractual rights or obligations of Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries), (C) changing or modifying any course of conduct regarding
future operations of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including, after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries),
(D) otherwise taking actions that would limit the respective freedom of action
of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) with respect to, or their
ability to retain, one or more of their respective businesses, assets or
rights or interests therein, (E) executing settlements, undertakings, consent
decrees, stipulations or other agreements

 



60  with any Governmental Authority or with any other Person and (F) committing
to take any such actions in the foregoing clauses (A) through (E) and (ii)
defending through litigation any Legal Action brought or threatened to be
brought by any Person (including any Governmental Authority) in order to avoid
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted or terminated, any Order that would
prevent the consummation of the Transactions from occurring prior to the
Termination Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not require the
Company or its Subsidiaries to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
be required to, take any action with respect to any Order or any applicable
Law which would bind the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time or in the event the Mergers do not occur.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or otherwise, (i) Parent
shall determine strategy and timing, lead all proceedings and coordinate all
activities with respect to seeking any actions, non-actions, terminations or
expirations of waiting periods, consents, approvals or waivers of any
Governmental Authority as contemplated hereby, (ii) the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, to take such actions as
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with obtaining any such actions,
non-actions, terminations or expirations of waiting periods, consents,
approvals or waivers and (iii) Parent shall have the sole and exclusive right
to propose, negotiate, offer or commit to make or effect any divestitures,
dispositions, or licenses of any assets, properties, products, rights,
services or businesses, or to agree to any other remedy, requirement,
obligation, condition or restriction related to the conduct of Parents, its
Affiliates, any other portfolio company or investment fund with Apollo Global
Management, LLC or the Companys and its Subsidiaries businesses in order to
resolve any Governmental Authoritys objections to or concerns about the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub and
Redbox Merger Sub shall not be required to agree to any amendment to, or
waiver under, this Agreement in connection with obtaining any requisite
consent or expiration of an applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.

 

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release regarding the
Transactions shall be a joint press release by the Company and Parent. Unless
and until an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred, Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements about this Agreement or any of
the Transactions, and shall give each other the reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon any such release or statement. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except to the extent required by applicable Law,
Order or the Nasdaq requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to consult with Parent in
connection with, or provide Parent an opportunity to review or comment upon,
any press release or other public statement or comment to be issued or made
with respect to any Takeover Proposal or with respect to any actions
contemplated by Section 5.4(e), Section 5.4(f) or Section 5.4(g) (if and to
the extent such public statement or comment is permitted by such Sections).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5.9 shall not (x) apply to any
press release or other public statement (a) that contains information that
has been previously announced or made public in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement or

 



61  (b) is made in the ordinary course of business and does not relate
specifically to the signing of this Agreement or the Transactions, or (y)
prohibit Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub, Redbox Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates from providing ordinary course communications regarding this
Agreement and the Transactions to existing or prospective general and limited
partners, equity holders, members, managers and investors of any Affiliates
of such Person who are subject to confidentiality restrictions prohibiting
further communications thereof.

Section 5.10  _Fees and Expenses_. Except as explicitly provided otherwise in
this Agreement, whether or not the Mergers are consummated, all expenses
(including those payable to Representatives) incurred by any party to this
Agreement or on its behalf in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions and the other Transaction Documents (" _Expenses_ ") shall be
paid by the party incurring those Expenses.

 

Section 5.11 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub and Redbox Merger Sub shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and obtain the Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions
(including the market "flex" provisions) set forth in the Financing
Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect
and comply with the Financing Letters, (ii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and
subject only to the conditions (including the market "flex" provisions) set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (or on other terms that, with respect to
conditionality, are not less favorable to Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub or
Redbox Merger Sub than the terms and conditions (including market "flex"
provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters), (iii) satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub and
Redbox Merger Sub in the Financing Letters and the definitive agreements
related thereto (including by consummating the Equity Financing at or prior to
the Closing on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Equity
Funding Letter) or, if necessary or deemed advisable by Parent, seek the
waiver of conditions applicable to Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub and Redbox
Merger Sub contained in such Financing Letters or such definitive agreements
related thereto, (iv) upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
to Parents, Outerwall Merger Subs and Redbox Merger Subs obligations to
consummate the Offer and the Mergers, consummate the Financing and cause the
lenders and the other Persons committing to fund the Financing to fund such
Financing at the Closing, (v) enforce its rights under the Financing Letters
and the definitive agreements relating to the Financing and (vi) otherwise
comply with Parents, Outerwall Merger Subs and Redbox Merger Subs covenants
and other obligations under the Financing Letters and the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing. Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub, Redbox
Merger Sub and the Guarantors shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Company, agree to or permit any termination of or amendment, supplement
or modification to be made to, or grant any waiver of any provision under, the
Financing Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing if
such termination, amendment, supplement, modification or waiver would (A)
reduce the aggregate amount of any portion of the Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or

 



62  original issue discount as compared to the fees and original issue discount
contemplated by the Financing Letters on the date of this Agreement unless the
Debt Financing or Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount)
such that the aggregate amount of the Financing would be below the amount
required to pay the Required Amount, (B) impose new or additional conditions
precedent to the availability of the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any of the conditions precedent to the Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the funding of the
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) or (C)
adversely impact the ability of Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub or Redbox Merger
Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect to the Financing.
Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any amendment,
modification, supplement, consent or waiver to or under any Financing Letter
or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing promptly upon execution
thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Section 5.11 shall require, and in no event shall the
reasonable best efforts of Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub or Redbox Merger Sub
be deemed or construed to require, either Parent or Outerwall Merger Sub to
(i) seek the Equity Financing from any source other than the counterparties
to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Funding
Letter, or (ii) pay any material fees in excess of those contemplated by the
Equity Funding Letter or the Debt Commitment Letters (including any market
"flex" provisions contained therein).

 

(b) Upon request by the Company, Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub and Redbox
Merger Sub shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably prompt basis and
in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing and provide to the Company drafts (reasonably in advance of
execution) and thereafter complete, correct and executed copies of the
material definitive documents for the Debt Financing. Parent, Outerwall
Merger Sub and Redbox Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (i) of
any material breach, default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any
party to any of the Financing Letters or definitive documents related to the
Financing of which Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub or Redbox Merger Sub becomes
aware, (ii) of the receipt by Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub or Redbox Merger
Sub of any written notice or other written communication from any Financing
source with respect to any (A) material breach, default, termination,
cancellation or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Letters or
any definitive document related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing or (B)
material dispute or disagreement between Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub and
Redbox Merger Sub and any Financing source or among any parties to any of the
Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing, in each
case regarding the Financing, and (iii) of the occurrence of an event or
development that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability
of Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub or Redbox Merger Sub to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount on the terms
and in the manner contemplated by the Financing Letters. As soon as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within two Business Days of the date the
Company delivers to Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub or Redbox Merger Sub a
written request, Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub and Redbox Merger Sub shall
provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred

 



63  to in the immediately preceding sentence. If any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any
applicable market "flex" provisions) contemplated by either the Redbox
Business Debt Commitment Letter or the Other Company Businesses Debt
Commitment Letter, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing and
Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub and Redbox Merger Sub shall use their reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable, in replacement
thereof alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient
to fund the Required Amount with terms and conditions (including
market "flex" provisions) not less favorable to Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub
and Redbox Merger Sub (or their respective Affiliates) than the terms and
conditions set forth in the Redbox Business Debt Commitment Letter or the
Other Company Businesses Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable. Parent shall
deliver to the Company true and complete copies of the alternative debt
commitment letters (including Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Debt
Financing. For purposes of this Agreement, references to (x) the " _Financing_
" shall include the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as

Senior Notes due 2019 or 5.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (collectively, the "
_Debt Securities_ "),  _provided_ that (x) the closing of any Debt Offer

or after Closing) the funds needed, if applicable, to satisfy and discharge
such Debt Securities in connection with such Debt Offer, and (z) the Company

redemption provisions of the applicable indenture and take any actions at or
prior to the Effective Time reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate any
such redemption and (B) take any other actions reasonably requested by Parent
to facilitate the satisfaction and discharge of such series of Debt
Securities pursuant to the satisfaction and discharge provisions of the
applicable indenture and the other provisions of such indenture applicable
thereto.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all such requested
cooperation provided in accordance with this Section 5.11 shall
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be
required to bear any cost or expense, pay any commitment or other fee, enter
into any definitive agreement, incur any other Liability, make any other
payment or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing or
any of the foregoing prior to the Effective Time. In addition, nothing in this
Section 5.11 shall require any action that would conflict with or violate the
Company Organizational Documents or any Law or result in, prior to the
Effective Time, the contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to
result in, prior to the Effective Time, a violation or breach of, or default
under, any Contract to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party if
such action could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, none of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors
(with respect to any Subsidiary of the Company) or employees shall be required
to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters that is not contingent upon
the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing and no directors
of the Company or managers of Redbox, acting in such capacity, shall be
required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to
the Financing. Parent (i) shall promptly, upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including (A) reasonable attorneys fees and (B) fees and
expenses of the Companys accounting

 



67  firms engaged to assist in connection with the Financing, including
reviewing any marketing materials, participating in any meetings) incurred by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in
connection with the Financing, including the cooperation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and Representatives contemplated by this Section 5.11(c) and
(ii) shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing (including the
performance of their respective obligations under, or the taking of or
refraining from any action in accordance with, this Section 5.11) and any
information used in connection therewith, in each case other than to the
extent any of the foregoing was suffered or incurred as a result of the bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or, in each case, their respective Affiliates and
Representatives.

 

(d) The Company hereby consents to the use of its logos solely in connection
with the Financing; _provided_ that Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub and Redbox
Merger Sub shall ensure that such logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or the
Companys reputation or goodwill and will comply with the Companys usage
requirements to the extent made available to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement.

(e) Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub and Redbox Merger Sub acknowledge and agree
that the obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a
condition to Closing.

 

(f) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts to periodically update any Required Financial Information
provided to Parent as may be necessary so that such Required Financial
Information is (i) Compliant and (ii) meets the applicable requirements set
forth in the definition of "Required Financial Information", in each case
throughout the pendency of the Marketing Period. For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent may, to most effectively access the financing markets, request the
cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries under this Section 5.11 at any
time, and from time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Marketing Period shall not be applicable as to each attempt to access the
markets. If, in connection with a marketing effort contemplated by either of
the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent reasonably requests the Company to file a
Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that contains material
non-public information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
which Parent reasonably determines (and which the Company does not
unreasonably object) to include in customary marketing materials for the Debt
Financing, then the Company shall file a Current Report on Form 8-K
containing such material non-public information.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
may enter discussions regarding, and may enter into arrangements and
agreements relating to the Equity Financing to add other equity providers, so
long as in respect of any such arrangements and agreements, the following
conditions are met: (i) the aggregate

 



68  amount of the Equity Financing is not reduced; (ii) the arrangements and
agreements, in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to delay, impede
or prevent the Closing; and (iii) the arrangements and agreements would not
diminish or release the pre-Closing obligations of the parties to the Equity
Funding Letter as of the date of this Agreement, adversely affect the rights
of Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub or Redbox Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Equity Funding Letter, or otherwise
constitute a waiver or reduction of Parents, Outerwall Merger Subs or Redbox
Merger Subs rights under the Equity Funding Letter. 

Section 5.12 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (and
shall be permitted to) take such steps as may be reasonably required or
advisable to cause dispositions of the Companys equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is
a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, of (a) any notice or other communication received by
such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement
or the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain
such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving LLC or Parent, (b) any Legal Actions commenced or, to such partys
Knowledge, threatened against such party which relates to this Agreement or
the Transactions and (c) any fact, event or circumstance that: (i) has had or
would reasonably be expected to result in any Company Material Adverse Effect
or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, or (ii) is reasonably likely
to result in the failure of any of the Offer Conditions or any of the
conditions set forth in Article VI to be satisfied; _provided_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.13 shall not affect any of
the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors or
officers relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 

Section 5.14 _Delisting_. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall
use its reasonable best efforts prior to the Closing Date to cause the Common
Stock to be delisted from the Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act
as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.15 _Rule 14d-10_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "
_Compensation Committee_ ") to the extent required will take such steps to
cause each employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement pursuant to which consideration is payable to any officer,
director or employee who is a holder of any security of the Company to be
approved by the Compensation Committee in accordance

 



69  with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the
instructions thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under
the Exchange Act and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.16 _Takeover Laws_. The Company and Parent shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no
Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and refrain
from taking any actions that would cause the applicability of such Laws and
(ii) if the restrictions of any Takeover Law become applicable to any of the
Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise lawfully eliminate or minimize the effect of such
Takeover Law on the Transactions.

Section 5.17 _Tax Returns._ The Company shall, to the extent permitted by Law,
timely file any Tax Return or other document with respect to any Taxes or
fees imposed on the Company as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (and Parent shall cooperate with respect thereto as necessary).

74  by the Company pursuant to Section 7.4(b) or Section 7.4(c)(i) and (B) the
material breach or material failure by Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub or Redbox
Merger Sub or the failure by Outerwall Merger Sub to commence the Offer
pursuant to Section 1.1(a) within three (3) Business Days of the time period
specified therein, as applicable, is the primary cause of the failure of the
Offer, the Offer Closing or the Closing, as applicable, to be consummated
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
then Parent shall pay to the Company an amount in cash equal to the Parent
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds, such payment
to be made within two (2) Business Days following such valid termination.

amount in cash equal to $53,700,000.

(g) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that the damages resulting from the valid termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee or Parent Expenses is or are payable are uncertain and
incapable of accurate calculation and that, without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement, and, therefore, the
Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses,
as applicable, if, as and when required pursuant to this Section 7.6, shall
not constitute a penalty, but rather liquidated damages, and in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the party receiving such amount in the
circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Mergers and
the Offer. The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall
either the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the
Parent Expenses, or Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee, as
the case may be, on more than one occasion.

(h) If the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section
7.6(b)(i), Section 7.6(b)(ii), Section 7.6(b)(iii) or Section 7.6(c), or
Parent fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 7.6(d), in
each case by the respective payment date specified in such Section, and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub or Redbox Merger
Sub, on the one hand, or the Company or Redbox, on the other hand, commences a
Legal Action that results in a final and non-appealable judgment against the
other party for the amount due pursuant to such Section, the Company shall
pay to Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub or Redbox Merger Sub, or Parent shall pay
to the Company, as applicable, such other partys reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket attorneys fees) up to a maximum aggregate amount of $1,500,000 in
connection with such Legal Action, in addition to such other amount or amounts
due pursuant to this Section 7.6, together with interest on each such amount
at the rate equal to the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as
published in The Wall Street

 



75  Journal, Eastern Edition, calculated on a daily basis from the date such
amounts were required to be paid to the date of actual payment. Any amount
payable pursuant to this Section 7.6(h) shall be paid by the applicable party
by wire transfer of same day funds prior to or on the date such payment is
required to be made as referenced in this Section 7.6(h).

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any
Transaction Document, but subject in all respects to Section 7.5, this
Section 7.6, Section 8.15 and Section 8.17 (including, in each case, the
limitations set forth or referenced herein and therein), if Parent, Outerwall
Merger Sub or Redbox Merger Sub fails to effect the Offer Closing or
the Closing when required pursuant to Section 1.1 or Section 1.4, as

(whether such breach is intentional, unintentional, willful, material or

unintentional, willful, material or otherwise), then the Company may seek one
or all of (but never receive more than one of) (A) a decree or order of
specific performance or any injunction or injunctions or other equitable
relief if and to the extent permitted by Section 8.15, (B) the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, Section 7.2 or Section

in respect of any other Contract, document or theory of Law or equity or in
respect of any representations, warranties or covenants made or alleged to be

and (ii) the Company, its Affiliates or any of the foregoings respective
Representatives seek, directly or indirectly, to recover against the Parent

language to Article III, the Company has or may have set forth information in
the Company Disclosure Schedule in a section of such Company Disclosure
Schedule that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it
relates. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall not constitute an admission by the Company that such
item is material, that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to

Section 8.15 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur if
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies (including those as set forth in Section 7.6) would not
be an adequate remedy for any such non-performance or breach. It
is accordingly agreed that, subject to

 



93  Section 8.15(b), the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Chosen Courts, without proof of damages or otherwise, this
being in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, and the parties to
this Agreement hereby waive any requirement for the posting of any bond or
similar collateral in connection therewith. Each party hereto agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that or otherwise assert that (a) the other
party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

otherwise to the contrary, and subject in all respect to this Section
8.15(b), in no event shall the Company or any Affiliate or stockholder thereof

or seek to enforce specifically Parents, Outerwall Merger Subs or Redbox
Merger Subs obligation to cause all or any portion of the Equity Financing to
be funded (whether under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) or
otherwise cause Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub or Redbox Merger Sub to take
action to consummate the Mergers, the Offer, the Financing or the other
transactions contemplated hereunder or any other Transaction Document or
otherwise (including the obligation to pay all or any portion of the Offer
Price and/or the Merger Consideration) unless and only if: (i) the Marketing
Period has ended, (ii) with respect to the Offer, the Offer Closing, the
payment of the Offer Price and the Equity Financing related thereto, all of
the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived (other than those Offer
Conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance
Time, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such Offer Conditions at the
Offer Acceptance Time), (iii) with respect to the Mergers, the payment of the
Merger Consideration and the Equity Financing related thereto, all the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), (iv)
the Debt Financing (or alternative financing in accordance with Section
5.11(b)) has been received by Parent in full in accordance with the terms
thereof, or such full amount will be funded to Parent at the Offer Closing or
Closing, as applicable, if the Equity Financing related thereto is funded at
the Offer Closing or Closing, as applicable ( _provided_ , that Parent,
Outerwall Merger Sub and Redbox Merger Sub shall not be required to draw down
the Equity Financing or consummate the Offer Closing or the Closing, as
applicable, if the Debt Financing (or alternative financing in accordance with
Section 5.11(b)) is not in fact funded at the Offer Closing or the Closing,
as applicable), (v) the Company has irrevocably and unconditionally confirmed
in writing to Parent that (A) if specific performance is granted and the
Equity Financing and Debt Financing (or alternative financing in accordance
with Section 5.11(b)) are funded, then the Closing will occur substantially
simultaneously with the drawdown of the Equity Financing and the Debt
Financing (or alternative financing in accordance with Section 5.11(b)) (and
the Company has not revoked, withdrawn, modified or conditioned such
confirmation) and (B) the Company is prepared, willing and able to effect the
Offer Closing, Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereunder, as
applicable, and (vi) Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub and Redbox Merger Sub fail
to complete the Offer

 



94  Closing or Closing, as applicable, within three (3) Business Days after
delivery of the Companys irrevocable and unconditional written confirmation.

otherwise, for the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may, subject in all
respects to Section 7.5, Section 7.6, this Section 8.15(b) and Section 8.17
(including, in each case, the limitations set forth therein), concurrently
seek (x) specific performance or other equitable relief, subject in all
respects to this Section 8.15(b), and (y) payment of the Parent Termination
Fee, if, as and when required pursuant to Section 7.6(d), under no
circumstances shall the Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or
entitled to receive (1) both a grant of specific performance to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the Equity
Funding Letter) or other equitable relief, on the one hand, and/or the payment
of any monetary damages whatsoever and/or the payment of all or any portion of
the Parent Termination Fee and/or any amount, if any, as and when due,
pursuant to Section 5.11 and Section 7.6(h), on the other hand, or (2) both
payment of any monetary damages whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of
any of the Parent Termination Fee and/or any amount, if any, as and when due,
pursuant to Section 5.11 and Section 7.6(h), on the other hand. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically

8.15 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection
with any such order or injunction.

Affiliates (and in the case of the Company, its Associated Parties), that all
Legal Actions (whether in Contract or in tort, at Law or in equity or

of the DGCL), together with the shares of Common Stock then owned by
Outerwall Merger Sub, do not represent at least one share more than 50% of the
then outstanding shares of Common Stock (the " _Minimum Condition_ ").

 

(b) _Orders_. Any Law or Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent,

Section 3.5, Section 3.8 (other than Section 3.8(a) and Section 3.8(c)),

import set forth therein) as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as
though made as of the Expiration Time (except to the extent expressly made
as   of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), except, in the
case of this clause (iv), where the failure to be true and correct would not,

capital stock of the Company or any non-wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company (other than a dividend expressly permitted by Section 5.1(b)(ii) of
the Agreement).

shall have made, any purchases (other than purchases as expressly permitted by
Section 5.1(c)(i) of the Agreement) of any shares of capital stock of the
Company or any non-wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (or any warrants,
options or other rights to acquire the foregoing).

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Outerwall
Merger Sub and, other than the Minimum Condition, may be waived by Parent and
Outerwall Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in
their respective sole discretion, in each case subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
The failure by Parent, Outerwall Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent
at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be

 



Annex I-2  deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect
to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with
respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.

The capitalized terms used in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement to which it is annexed unless specifically defined in this
Annex I.

 



Annex I-3 _Exhibit A-1_

 

AMENDED AND RESTATED

 

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF

 

OUTERWALLL INC.

(a Delaware corporation)

ARTICLE I

 

The name of the Corporation is Outerwall Inc.

 

ARTICLE II

The address of the Corporations registered office in the State of Delaware
is Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington,
New Castle County, Delaware 19808. The name of the Corporations registered
agent at such address is Corporation Service Company.

ARTICLE III

 

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware as it now exists or may hereafter be amended and/or
supplemented from time to time (the " _DGCL_ ").

 

ARTICLE IV

The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation is
authorized to issue is one thousand (1,000) shares of capital stock, all of
which shall be common stock with a par value of one-tenth of one cent ($0.001)
per share (the " _Common Stock_ "). Each holder of record of Common Stock
shall be entitled to vote at all meetings of the stockholders and shall have
one vote for each share held by such holder of record.

 

ARTICLE V

From time to time, any of the provisions of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered or repealed, and other
provisions authorized by the DGCL or other statutes or laws of the State of
Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted in the manner and at
the time prescribed by said laws, and all rights at any time conferred upon
the stockholders of the Corporation by this Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation are granted subject to this reservation. 

ARTICLE VI

In furtherance and not in limitation of the rights, powers, privileges and
discretionary authority granted or conferred by the DGCL or other statutes or
laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors of the Corporation
(the " _Board_ ") is expressly authorized to make, alter, amend or repeal the
Bylaws of the Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "), without any action on the part
of the stockholders, but the stockholders may make, alter, amend or repeal
the Bylaws whether adopted by them or otherwise. ARTICLE VII

 

Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws shall so
require.

 

ARTICLE VIII

No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation
or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors duty of
loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions
not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, as the same exists or
hereafter may be amended, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director
derived an improper personal benefit. If the DGCL is amended to authorize the
further elimination or limitation of liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of the Corporation, in addition to the limitation on
personal liability provided herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the amended DGCL. Any repeal or modification of this Article VIII
by the stockholders of the Corporation shall be prospective only and shall
not adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of
the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

 

ARTICLE IX

Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of Delaware,
as the Bylaws may provide. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any
annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing,
setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding Common Stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares of Common Stock entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and
shall be delivered to the Corporation.

 

The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision contained
in the DGCL) within or outside of the State of Delaware at such place or
places as may be designated from time to time by the Board or in the Bylaws.

ARTICLE X

 

Neither any contract or other transaction between the Corporation and any
other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
firm, association, or other entity (an " _Entity_ "), nor any other acts of
the Corporation with relation to any other Entity will, in the absence of
fraud, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in any way
be invalidated or otherwise affected by the fact that any one or more of the
directors or officers of the Corporation are pecuniary or otherwise interested
in, or are directors, officers, partners, or members of, such other Entity
(such directors, officers, and Entities, each a " _Related Person_ "). Any
Related Person may be a party to, or may be pecuniary or otherwise interested
in, any contract or transaction of the Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the fact that person is a Related Person or is pecuniary or otherwise
interested in such contract or transaction is disclosed or is known to the
Board or a majority of directors present at any meeting of the Board at which
action upon any such contract or transaction is taken. Any director of the
Corporation who is also a Related Person or who is pecuniary or otherwise
interested in such contract or transaction may be counted in determining the
existence of a quorum at any meeting of the Board during which any such
contract or transaction is authorized and may vote thereat to authorize any
such  contract or transaction, with like force and effect as if such person were
not a Related Person or were not pecuniary or otherwise interested in such
contract or transaction. Any director of the Corporation may vote upon any
contract or any other transaction between the Corporation and any subsidiary
or affiliated Entity without regard to the fact that such person is also a
director, officer, manager, general partner or other fiduciary of such
subsidiary or affiliated Entity.

Any contract, transaction or act of the Corporation or of the directors of the
Corporation that is ratified at any annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation, or at any special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation
called for such purpose, will, insofar as permitted by applicable law, be as
valid and as binding as though ratified by every stockholder of the
Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure of the stockholders to
approve or ratify any such contract, transaction or act, when and if
submitted, will not be deemed in any way to invalidate the same or deprive
the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees, of its or their right
to proceed with such contract, transaction or act.

 

Subject to any express agreement that may from time to time be in effect, (x)
any director or officer of the Corporation who is also an officer, director,
partner, employee, managing director or other affiliate of either Apollo
Management VIII, L.P., on behalf of its investment funds (" _Apollo_ "), or
any of its respective affiliates (collectively, the " _Managers_ ") and (y)
the Managers and their affiliates, may, and shall have no duty not to, in each
case on behalf of the Managers or their affiliates (the persons and entities
in clauses (x) and (y), each a " _Covered Manager Person_ "), to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, (i) carry on and conduct, whether
directly, or as a partner in any partnership, or as a member or manager in any
limited liability company or as a joint venturer in any joint venture, or as
an officer, director or stockholder of any corporation, or as a participant in
any syndicate, pool, trust or association, any business of any kind, nature or
description, whether or not such business is competitive with or in the same
or similar lines of business as the Corporation, (ii) do business with any
client, customer, vendor or lessor of any of the Corporation or its
affiliates, and (iii) make investments in any kind of property in which the
Corporation may make investments. To the fullest extent permitted by Section
122(17) of the DGCL, the Corporation hereby renounces any interest or
expectancy of the Corporation to participate in any business of the Managers
or their affiliates, and waives any claim against a Covered Manager Person
and shall indemnify a Covered Manager Person against any claim that such
Covered Manager Person is liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of such persons or entitys
participation in any such business.

In the event that a Covered Manager Person acquires knowledge of a potential
transaction or matter which may constitute a corporate opportunity for both
(x) the Covered Manager Person, in his or her Apollo-related capacity, as the
case may be, or Apollo or its affiliates, as the case may be, and (y) the
Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Covered Manager
Person shall not have any duty to offer or communicate information regarding
such corporate opportunity to the Corporation. To the fullest
extent permitted by Section 122(17) of the DGCL, the Corporation hereby
renounces any interest or expectancy of the Corporation in such corporate
opportunity and waives any claim against each Covered Manager Person and shall
indemnify a Covered Manager Person against any claim that such Covered
Manager Person is liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for breach of
any fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact that such Covered Manager
Person (i) pursues or acquires any corporate opportunity for its own account
or the account of any affiliate, (ii) directs, recommends, sells, assigns or
otherwise transfers such corporate opportunity to another person or (iii) does
not communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to the
Corporation. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest
in any shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have
notice of and to have consented to the provisions of this Article X.

This Article X may not be amended, modified or repealed without the prior
written consent of each of the Managers.

In the event of a conflict between this Article X and any other Article or
provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, this
Article X shall prevail under all circumstances. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, under no circumstances shall any employee of the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries be deemed to be a "Covered Manager
Person", and under no circumstances shall the Corporation waive or renounce
any interest or expectancy of the Corporation in, or in being offered any
opportunity to participate in, any business opportunities that are presented
to any Manager who is also an employee of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries, irrespective of whether such employee is a director or officer
of the Corporation of any of its affiliates.

ARTICLE XI

 

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any
derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any
action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any
director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the Corporation to the
Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (c) any action asserting a
claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or (d) any action
asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or
entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of
capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and
consented to the provisions of this Article XI.

ARTICLE XII

The Corporation elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL. _Exhibit A-2_

 

AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS

 

OF

OUTERWALL INC. 

(Adopted [●], 2016)

 

ARTICLE I

_Offices_

 

Section 1\. _Registered Office; Registered Agent_. The registered office of
Outerwall Inc. (the " _Corporation_ ") in the State of Delaware, and the name
of its registered agent at such address, shall be as set forth in the Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (as the same may
be amended and/or restated from time to time, the " _Certificate of
Incorporation_ "). The Corporations registered agent in the State of
Delaware, and the address of such registered agent, may be changed from time
to time by or under the authority of the board of directors of
the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ ") in the manner provided in the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").

 

Section 2\. _Other Offices_. The Corporation may have a principal or other
office or offices at such other place or places, either within or without the
State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine
or as shall be necessary or appropriate for the conduct of the business of the
Corporation.

 

ARTICLE II

_Stockholders _

Section 1\. _Place of Meetings_. All meetings of stockholders shall be held at
the principal office of the Corporation or at such other place, if any,
within or without the State of Delaware, or by means of remote communication,
as may be designated by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the
meeting.

 

Section 2\. _Annual Meetings_. An annual meeting of stockholders for the
election of directors and the transaction of such other business as may
properly come before the meeting shall be held on such day and at such hour,
as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors and designated in the notice of
the meeting. At each annual meeting, the stockholders entitled to vote
shall elect a Board of Directors and may transact such other corporate
business as may properly be brought before the meeting.

Section 3.  _Special Meetings_. A special meeting of the stockholders (or of
any class thereof) for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by
the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or by order of the Board of
Directors and shall be called by the President or the Secretary upon the
written request therefor delivered to the President or Secretary signed by
stockholders holding of record more than 50% of the outstanding shares of
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting. Such written
request shall state the

 



1  purpose or purposes for which such meeting is to be called and the call
therefor shall be issued within 60 days after the receipt of said request.
Business transacted at all special meetings shall be confined to the objects
specifically stated in the call therefor.

Section 4\. _Notice of Meetings_. Except as otherwise expressly required by
law, written notice of each meeting of stockholders, whether annual or
special, shall be given at least 10 and not more than 60 days before the date
on which the meeting is to be held to each stockholder of record entitled
to vote thereat by delivering a notice thereof to such stockholder personally
or by mailing such notice in a postage prepaid envelope directed to such
stockholder at such stockholders address as it appears on the stock ledger of
the Corporation, unless such stockholder shall have filed with the Secretary
of the Corporation a written request that notices intended for such
stockholder be directed to another address, in which case such notice shall be
directed to such stockholder at the address designated in such request.
Notices of each meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, shall set
forth the date, time, place, if any, the means of remote communications, if
any, by which stockholders or proxy holders may be deemed to be present in
person and vote at such meeting, the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting (if such date is different from
the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting). Notices
of each special meeting of stockholders shall also set forth the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called. In lieu of written notice, notice
may be given by electronic transmission if permitted by applicable law and if
given in compliance therewith. If electronically transmitted by means of
facsimile telecommunication or electronic mail, then notice is deemed given
when transmitted and directed to a facsimile number or electronic mail
address, as the case may be, at which the stockholder has consented to
receive notice. If mailed, notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited
in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder in the
manner set forth herein. An affidavit of the Secretary or of the transfer
agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given shall,
in the absence of fraud, be _prima facie_ evidence of the facts stated
therein.

 

Section 5\. _List of Stockholders_. The Secretary or any Assistant Secretary
of the Corporation shall produce, at least 10 days before every meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote thereat
(provided, however, if the record date for determining the stockholders
entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days before the date of the meeting,
the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day
before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the
address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of
such stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least
10 days prior to the meeting, either on a reasonably accessible electronic
network as permitted by law (provided that the information required to gain
access to the list is provided with the notice of the meeting) or during
ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation.
If the meeting is to be held at a place, such list shall be produced and kept
at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be
examined by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held
solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to
the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a
reasonably accessible electronic network (provided that the information
required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the
meeting). Except as otherwise provided by law, the original or duplicate
stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to the stockholders entitled to
examine such list or to vote in person or by proxy at such meeting.

 



2 Section 6\. _Quorum; Adjournment of Meetings_. Except as otherwise provided by
law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Amended and Restated Bylaws of
the Corporation (" _Bylaws_ "), the presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of stock
entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business at all meetings of the stockholders. The stockholders present at a
duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do
business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough
stockholders to leave less than a quorum. If less than a quorum shall be
present or represented at the time for which the meeting shall have been
called, the stockholders so present in person or by proxy at such meeting
may, by a majority in voting power thereof, adjourn the meeting from time to
time without any notice or call other than by an announcement at the meeting
of the time and place of the adjourned meeting, until a quorum shall attend.
Any meeting or adjournment thereof at which a quorum is present may also be
adjourned in like manner without notice or call or upon such notice or call as
may be determined by vote of the holders of a majority in voting power voting
thereon. If, however, the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to
vote at such meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for
determination of stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned
meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an
earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote
at the adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to
each stockholder of record as of the record date so fixed for notice of such
adjourned meeting. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be
present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted if
the meeting had been held as originally called.

Section 7.  _Voting_. Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation, at every meeting of stockholders, each holder of record of the
issued and outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such
meeting shall be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each such
share of stock having voting power upon the matter in question held by such
stockholder. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or
to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may
authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but
no proxy shall be voted after three years from its date unless the proxy
provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable
if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is
coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A
proxy may remain irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it
is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the
Corporation generally. Shares of its own capital stock belonging to the
Corporation directly or indirectly shall not be voted directly or indirectly;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the
Corporation to vote any shares of the Corporations stock held by it in a
fiduciary capacity (and to count such shares for purposes of determining a
quorum). Except as otherwise required by the laws of the State of Delaware or
the Certificate of Incorporation, and except for the election of directors,
at all meetings of the stockholders, a quorum being present, all matters shall
be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting
power of the shares of stock entitled to vote thereon which are

 



3  present in person or by proxy. Directors shall be elected by plurality of
the votes cast at a meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is
present. Unless demanded by a stockholder of the Corporation present in
person or by proxy at any meeting of the stockholders and entitled to vote
thereat before the meeting begins, or so directed by the person presiding at
the meeting or required by the laws of the State of Delaware, the election of
directors of the Corporation or the vote on any other question presented at
the meeting need not be by ballot. On any vote by ballot, each ballot shall be
signed by the stockholder voting, or in such stockholders name by
such stockholders proxy, if there be such a proxy, and shall state the
number of shares voted by such stockholder and the number of votes to which
each share is entitled.

 

Section 8\. _Organization of Meeting_. The Chairman of the Board, if any,
shall preside at all meetings of stockholders, or in his or her absence, the
Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, shall preside, or in his or her absence,
the President of the Corporation shall preside. If neither the Chairman of the
Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board or the President is present at
the meeting, the holders of a majority of the shares present at the meeting
and entitled to vote, in person or by proxy, shall select a person to preside
at the meeting. Subject to the requirements of any applicable law or the rules
and regulations of any national securities exchange, national securities
association or interdealer quotation system upon which the Corporations
securities may be listed, the person presiding at a meeting of stockholders
shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting,
including, without limitation, the regulation of the manner of voting and the
conduct of any discussion, as he or she believes to be in order. The Secretary
of the Corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings of stockholders, or
in his or her absence, any Assistant Secretary of the Corporation who is
present shall act as secretary of the meeting, or if no Assistant Secretary
shall be present, the person presiding at such meeting shall appoint a
secretary for that particular meeting.

Section 9\. _Action Without a Meeting_. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at
any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a
meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in
writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such corporate action at a meeting at which
all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be
delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law. Prompt notice
of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous
consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in
writing. In the event that the action which is consented to is such as would
have required the filing of a certificate with any governmental body, if such
action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, the certificate
filed shall state, in lieu of any statement required by law concerning any
vote of stockholders, that consent had been given in accordance with the
provisions of Section 228 of the DGCL. Without limiting the manner by which
consent may be given, written consent may be given by means of electronic
transmission in the manner prescribed by Section 228 of the DGCL.

Section 10.  _Ratification of Acts of Directors and Officers_. Except as
otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, any
transaction or contract or act of the Corporation or of the directors or the
officers of the Corporation may be ratified by the

been necessary to approve such transaction, contract or act at a meeting of
stockholders, or by the written consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting.

 _Board of Directors_

 

Section 1\. _General Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors, except
as may be otherwise provided by the DGCL or the Certificate of Incorporation.

Section 2\. _Number of Directors; Term of Office_. The Board of Directors
shall consist of three members but may be increased or decreased as
hereinafter provided. Each director shall hold office until the annual meeting
of the stockholders next following his or her election and until his or her
successor shall have been elected and shall qualify, or until his or her
death, resignation or removal from office. At any time or from time to time at
a special meeting called for that purpose, the Board of Directors, by the
vote of a majority of the entire Board, may increase the number of directors
of the Corporation, or may decrease the number of directors of the
Corporation; provided, however, that in no event shall the number of directors
of the Corporation be less than one. Directors shall be elected at the annual
meeting of stockholders. Directors need not be stockholders or residents of
the State of Delaware. Except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, elections
of directors need not be by written ballot.

 

Section 3\. _Quorum; Manner of Acting; Telephonic Participation_. Unless
otherwise provided by law, the presence of a majority of the entire Board of
Directors shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business. In the absence of a quorum, the directors present shall adjourn the
meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present. Notice of
any adjourned meeting need not be given. At all meetings of the directors, a
quorum being present, all matters shall be decided by the affirmative vote of
a majority of the directors present, except as otherwise required by the laws
of the State of Delaware or the Certificate of Incorporation. All or any one
or more directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or of
any committee thereof by means of conference telephone or similar
communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the
meeting can hear each other and participation in a meeting pursuant to such
communications equipment shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
The minutes of any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee
thereof held by telephone shall be prepared in the same manner as a meeting of
the Board of Directors or of such committee held in person.

 

Section 4\. _Place of Meetings_. The Board of Directors may hold its meetings
at such place or places, within or without the State of Delaware, as the
Board of Directors may from time to time determine.

Section 5\. _Annual Meeting_. As promptly as practicable after each annual
meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors, the Board of
Directors shall meet for the purpose of the appointment of officers and the
transaction of such other business as may properly 

 



5  come before the meeting. Notice of such meeting need not be given if held
immediately after the annual meeting of stockholders. Such meeting may be held
at any other time or place as shall be specified in a notice given as
hereinafter provided for special meetings of the Board of Directors or in a
waiver of notice thereof signed by all the directors.

 

Section 6\. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may
be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Delaware, as
shall from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors. After there
has been such determination, and notice thereof has been given to each member
of the Board of Directors, regular meetings may be held without
further notice being given.

Section 7\. _Special Meetings and Notice Thereof_. Special meetings of the
Board of Directors shall be held whenever called by the Chairman of the
Board, if any, the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or by a
majority of the directors. Notice of the time, date and place of each such
meeting shall be mailed to each director, addressed to him or her at his or
her residence or usual place of business, at least four days before the date
on which the meeting is to be held, or shall be given to him or her by
telegram, telex, mailgram, facsimile transmission, electronic mail or other
means of electronic transmission, or be delivered personally or by telephone,
not later than the day before the day on which such meeting is to be held.
Such notice shall state the time and place of the meeting, but need not state
the purposes thereof. In lieu of the notice to be given as set forth above, a
waiver thereof in writing, signed by the director or directors entitled to
said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent thereto for purposes of this Section 7\. If mailed, such notice
shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail so
addressed, with first-class postage thereon prepaid. If sent by any other
means (including facsimile, courier, electronic mail or express mail, etc.),
such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when actually delivered to the
home or business address, electronic address or facsimile number of the
director. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting, and objects at the beginning of the meeting, to
the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings of the
Board of Directors may fix any place, either within or without the State of
Delaware, as the place for holding any special meeting of the Board of
Directors called by them.

 

Section 8\. _Removal_. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of
Incorporation or applicable law, the entire Board of Directors or any
individual director may be removed from office with or without cause by the
holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding stock entitled to
vote at an election of directors. In case the Board of Directors or any one
or more directors be so removed, one or more individuals may be appointed at
the same meeting at which such director or directors have been so removed to
fill the vacancy or vacancies created thereby, to serve for the remainder of
the terms, respectively, of the director or directors so removed.

Section 9\. _Resignation_. Any director of the Corporation may resign at any
time by giving written notice thereof to the Chairman of the Board, if any,
the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or the Secretary of the
Corporation. The resignation of any

 



6  director shall take effect upon receipt of notice thereof or at such later
time as shall be specified in such notice; and, unless otherwise specified
therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it
effective.

Section 10\. _Vacancies on Board of Directors_. If any vacancy occurs in the
Board of Directors caused by the death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal from office of any director or otherwise, or any
new directorship is created by any increase in the authorized number of
directors, a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a
quorum, may fill the vacancy or newly created directorship, as the case may
be, or such vacancy or newly created directorship may be filled at an annual
meeting or at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose.
Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of
stockholders and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall be
qualified or until his or her death, resignation or removal from office.

 

Section 11 _Waiver of Notice and Consent_. The transactions of any meeting of
the Board of Directors, however called and noticed or wherever held, shall be
as valid as though such meeting had been duly held after a regular call and
notice, if a quorum be present and if, before or after the meeting, each of
the directors not present signs or electronically transmits a written waiver
of notice of such meeting whether before or after the date stated therein.
Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or
special meeting of directors or members of a committee of directors need be
specified in any written waiver of notice. All such waivers shall be filed
with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.

 

Section 12\. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may, by resolution of the
Board of Directors, designate one or more committees, each committee to
consist of one or more directors of the Corporation, which, to the extent
provided in the resolution or in these Bylaws, shall have and may exercise
such powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business
and affairs of the Corporation, as the Board of Directors may by resolution
determine and specify in the respective resolutions appointing them, subject
to such restrictions as may be contained in the Certificate of Incorporation
or the laws of the State of Delaware. Such committee or committees shall have
such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolutions
adopted by the Board of Directors. The committees shall keep regular minutes
of their proceedings and report the same to the Board of Directors when
required. A majority of all the members of any such committee may fix its
rules of procedure, determine its action and fix the time and place, whether
within or without the State of Delaware, of its meetings and specify what
notice thereof, if any, shall be given, unless the Board of Directors shall
otherwise by resolution provide. The Board of Directors shall have the power
to change the membership of any such committee at any time, to fill
vacancies thereon and to discharge any such committee, either with or without
cause, at any time. Each member of any such committee shall be paid such fee,
if any, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors for each meeting of such
committee which he or she shall attend and for his or her expenses, if any,
of attendance at each regular or special meeting of such committee as shall be
determined by the Board of Directors.

 

Section 13\. _Action Without Meeting_. Any action required or permitted to be
taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof
may be taken without

 



7  a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or of such committee, as
the case may be, consent thereto in writing, or by electronic transmission and
the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed
with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors, or committee.

Section 14\. _Fees and Compensation_. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may, if
it so desires, authorize members of the Board of Directors to be compensated
for their expenses, if any, of attendance at each regular or special meeting
of the Board of Directors. Such compensation may, in the Board of Directors
discretion, also include a fixed sum for each meeting and an annual fee for
serving as a director, such as may be allowed by resolution of the Board of
Directors. Directors who are officers or employees of the Corporation may
receive, if the Board of Directors desires, fees for serving as directors.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any director from
serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation
therefor.

Section 1\. _Certificates of Shares_. The shares of the Corporation shall be
represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide
by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series
of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not
apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate
is surrendered to the Corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a
resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock represented by
certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name
of the Corporation by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of
Directors, or the President or Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an
Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the
Corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, where any such certificate is signed (a) by a
transfer agent or an assistant transfer agent, or (b) by a transfer clerk
acting on behalf of the Corporation and a registrar, if the Board of
Directors shall by resolution so authorize, the signature of such Chairman of
the Board, President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary, Assistant
Treasurer or Assistant Secretary may be facsimiles thereof. In case any
officer or officers of the Corporation who shall have signed, or whose
facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used on, any such
certificate shall cease to be such officer or officers, whether by reason of
death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate shall have been
delivered by the Corporation, such certificate may nevertheless be adopted by
the Corporation and be issued and delivered as though the person or persons
who signed such certificate, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall
have been affixed thereto, had not ceased to be such officer or officers.

Section 2\. _Stock Ledger_. A record shall be kept by the Secretary, transfer
agent or by any other officer, employee or agent designated by the Board of
Directors of the name of the person, firm or corporation holding the stock
represented by such certificate, the number of shares represented by such
certificate, and the date of issuance thereof, and in case of cancellation,
the date of cancellation.

Section 3.  _Cancellation_. Every certificate surrendered to the Corporation
for exchange or transfer shall be cancelled, and no new certificate or
certificates shall be issued in exchange for any existing certificate until
such existing certificate shall have been so cancelled, except in cases
provided for in Section 6 of this Article V.

Section 4\. _Transfers of Stock_. Transfers of shares of the capital stock of
the Corporation shall be made only on the books of the Corporation by the
registered holder thereof, or by his attorney thereunto authorized by power of
attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation or
with a transfer clerk or a transfer agent appointed as provided in Section 5
of this Article V, and on surrender of the certificate or certificates, if
any, for such shares properly endorsed and the payment of all taxes thereon.
The person in whose name shares of stock stand on the books of the Corporation
shall be deemed the owner thereof for all purposes as regards the Corporation;

of Incorporation or these Bylaws, concerning the issue, transfer and
registration of shares of the stock of the Corporation. It may appoint, or
authorize any principal officer or officers to appoint, one or more transfer
clerks or one or more transfer agents and one or more registrars, and may
require all certificates of stock to bear the signature or signatures of any
of them.

 

Section 6\. _Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates_. As a
condition to the issue of a new certificate or uncertificated shares of stock
in the place of any certificate theretofore issued and alleged to have been
lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, the Board of Directors, in its
discretion, may require the owner of any such certificate, or his legal
representatives, to give the Corporation a bond in such sum and in such form
as it may direct or to otherwise indemnify the Corporation against any claim
that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft, mutilation
or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new
certificate or uncertificated shares. Proper evidence of such loss, theft,
mutilation or destruction shall be procured for the Board of Directors, if
required. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may authorize the
issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares without any bond
when in its judgment it is proper to do so.

 

Section 7\. _Record Date_.

 

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board
of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board
of Directors, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law,
not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of
such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also
be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such
record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be
the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board
of Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as
the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting
the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to

 



12  exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of
stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date
shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no such record
date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such
purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 

(c) Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation, in order
that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten (10) days after
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors. If no record date for determining stockholders entitled to
express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting is fixed by
the Board of Directors, (i) when no prior action of the Board of Directors is
required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be the first date on
which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to
be taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law,
and (ii) if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, the
record date for such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on
which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

13 Section 3\. _Dividends; Reserves_.

 

(a) Subject to any restrictions contained in the Certificate of Incorporation,
the Board of Directors may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of the
Corporations capital stock from the Corporations surplus, or if there be
none, out of its net profits for the current fiscal year and/or the preceding
fiscal year. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property or in shares
of capital stock of the Corporation, subject to the provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully
paid shares, the Corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares

consideration actually paid thereon. Dividends shall be payable upon such
dates as the Board of Directors may designate.

capital stock of the Corporation, the Board of Directors shall,
by resolution, direct that there be designated as capital in respect of such
shares an amount which is not less than the aggregate par value of par value
shares being declared as a dividend and, in the case of shares without par
value being declared as a dividend, such amount as shall be determined by the
Board of Directors; provided, however, that no such designation as capital
shall be necessary if shares are being distributed by the Corporation pursuant
to a split-up or division of its stock. 

(c) The Board of Directors may set apart out of the funds of the Corporation
available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may
abolish any such reserve.

Section 4\. _Corporate Seal_. The Board of Directors may adopt a corporate
seal. The corporate seal shall consist of a die bearing the name of the
corporation and the inscription, "Corporate Seal-Delaware." Said seal may be
used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or
reproduced or otherwise.

Section 1\. _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party
or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any

investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or an
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation,
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee, agent or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise (hereinafter an "indemnitee") shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent
permitted by Delaware law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended
(but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights
than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment),
against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees,

 



14  judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection
therewith; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to
indemnify any indemnitee in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required
to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by the Board of
Directors, (iii) such indemnification is provided by the Corporation, in its
sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Corporation under the
DGCL or (iv) such indemnification is required to be made under Section 3 of
this Article VIII.

Section 2\. _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. In addition to the right
to indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this Article VIII, an indemnitee
shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred in appearing at, participating in or
defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition or in
connection with a proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article VIII (which
shall be governed by Section 3 of this Article VIII) (hereinafter an
"advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that, any advancement of
expenses hereunder in connection with any such proceeding shall be made solely
upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an
"undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified in connection with such
proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined
pursuant to Section 4 of this Section Article VIII, no advance shall be made
by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 2 to an officer of the Corporation
with respect to any action or omission occurring prior to the effectiveness
of these Bylaws (except by reason of the fact that such officer is or was a
director of the Corporation in which event this sentence shall not apply) in
any proceeding if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the
Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who
were not parties to the proceeding, or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable,
or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by
independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the
decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate
clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner
that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation.

Section 3.  _Enforcement_. If a claim under Section 1 or Section 2 of this
Article VIII is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days
after a written claim for indemnification has been received by the
Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in
which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may
at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the
unpaid amount of the claim or to obtain advancement of expenses, as
applicable. To the fullest extent permitted by law, if successful in whole or
in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover
an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or
defending such suit. In connection with any claim for indemnification, the
Corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that
the indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct that makes it permissible
under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the indemnitee for the amount
claimed. In connection with any claim by an officer of the Corporation with
respect to any action or omission prior to the effectiveness of these Bylaws
(except in any action, suit or

 



15  proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by
reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of the
Corporation) for advances, the Corporation shall be entitled to raise a
defense as to any such action clear and convincing evidence that such person
acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or
not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, that such person acted without reasonable cause
to believe that such persons conduct was lawful. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or
its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such action that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the
circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought
by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement
of expenses hereunder, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under
this Article VIII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

 

Section 4\. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by
this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person
may have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such persons
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office.
The Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts
with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents
respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited
by the DGCL, or by any other applicable law.

Section 5.  _Survival of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by this
Article VIII shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors and administrators of such a person.

Section 6\. _Insurance_. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, or any
other applicable law, the Corporation, upon approval by the Board of
Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or
permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Article VIII.

 

Section 7\. _Amendments_. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article
VIII that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or his or her
successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such
right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged
occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such
amendment or repeal.

Section 8\. _Saving Clause_. If this Article VIII or any portion hereof shall
be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and executive officer
to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Article
VIII that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other

 



16  applicable law. If this Article VIII shall be invalid due to the application
of the indemnification provisions of another jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall indemnify each director and executive officer to the full
extent under any other applicable law.

Section 9\. _Nature of Rights_. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this
Article VIII shall be contract rights (and, without the necessity of entering
into an express contract, all such rights shall be effective to the same
extent and as if provided for in a contract between the Corporation and
the indemnitee) and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director, officer or trustee and shall inure to the benefit of
the indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment,
alteration or repeal of this Article VIII that adversely affects any right of
an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit,
eliminate, or impair any such right with respect to any proceeding involving
any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that
took place prior to such amendment or repeal.

Section 10\. _Certain Definitions_. For the purposes of this Article VIII,
the following definitions shall apply:

(a) The term " _proceeding_ " shall be broadly construed and shall include,
without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution, defense,
settlement, arbitration and appeal of, and the giving of testimony in, any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative.

(b) The term " _expenses_ " shall be broadly construed and shall
include, without limitation, court costs, attorneys fees, witness fees,
fines, amounts paid in settlement or judgment and any other costs and expenses
of any nature or kind incurred in connection with any proceeding.

 

(c) The term the " _Corporation_ " shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger that, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or
was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or
is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position
under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or
surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent
corporation if its separate existence had continued.

(d) References to a " _director_ ," " _executive officer_ ," " _officer_ ," "
_employee_ ," or " _agent_ " of the Corporation shall include, without
limitation, situations where such person is serving at the request of the
Corporation as, respectively, a director, executive officer,
officer, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

(e) References to " _other enterprises_ " shall include employee benefit
plans; references to " _fines_ " shall include any excise taxes assessed on a
person with respect to an

 



17  employee benefit plan; and references to " _serving at the request of the
Corporation_ " shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation that imposes duties on, or involves services by,
such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit
plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith
and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to
have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation"
as referred to in this Article VIII.

7\. _Management_.

 

(a) _Authorization_. The business and affairs of the LLC shall be managed by

in which, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement and as
otherwise required by the Act, is vested the full, exclusive and complete
power, authority and discretion to manage and control the administration,
affairs and operations of the LLC. The Board of Managers is the manager of the
LLC for the purposes of the Act and, notwithstanding the last sentence of
Section 18-402 of the Act, no Manager may bind the LLC except as provided in
this Agreement or in a resolution of the Board of Managers adopted pursuant to
this Agreement. The Member hereby appoints each person set forth on _Annex A_
hereto to the Board of Managers, and each person on the Board of Managers
is hereinafter referred to as a " _Manager_." The Member agrees that all
determinations, decisions and actions made or taken by the Board of Managers
in accordance with this Agreement shall be conclusive and absolutely binding
upon the LLC, the Member and the Members successors, assigns and personal
representatives.

(b) _Managers_. The initial number of members of the Board of Managers shall
be eleven (11) and the Board of Managers shall initially be comprised of the
persons set forth on _Annex A_ hereto. The authorized number of members of the
Board of Managers may be increased or decreased by the Member at any time in

designated or appointed by the Member shall hold office until a successor is
elected and qualified or until such Managers earlier death, resignation,
expulsion or removal.

 



2 (c) _Voting; Quorum_. Each Manager shall have one (1) vote. Unless a higher
number of votes is otherwise required by this Agreement, a majority of the
Managers, either present (in person or by teleconference) or represented by
proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at a meeting
of the Board of Managers. Any action taken by the Board of Managers
(including the giving of consent, waivers or approvals) must be approved by
the consent of a majority of the Managers present at a meeting at which there
is a quorum, unless otherwise set forth in this Agreement.

(d) _Resignation and Removal of Managers_. Any Manager may resign at any time
by delivering written notice of such resignation to the Member. Such
resignation shall take effect at the time specified in such notice or, if the
time is not specified, upon receipt thereof by the Member. Unless otherwise
specified therein, acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to
make it effective. Any or all of the Managers may be removed at any time, with
or without cause and for any reason or no reason at all, by the Member in its
sole and absolute discretion.

 

(e) _Committees_. The Board of Managers may, from time to time, delegate to
one or more persons (including any Member or Officer and including through
the creation and establishment of one or more other committees) such authority
and duties as the Board of Managers may deem advisable. Any delegation
pursuant to this _Section 7(f)_ may be revoked at any time by the Board of
Managers. The members of any committee of the Board of Managers shall be
determined by the Member in its sole and absolute discretion.

meetings in such place or places, within or without the State of Delaware, as
the Board of Managers may from time to time determine by resolution. At all
meetings of the Board of Managers, business shall be transacted in such order
as shall from time to time be determined by resolution of the Board
of Managers.

(g) _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Managers shall be
held at such times and places as shall be designated from time to time by
resolution of the Board of Managers. Notice of such regular meetings shall not
be required if held at the times and places set forth in the relevant
resolution and such resolution has been provided to each Manager. Any Manager
may be excluded from any meeting or portion thereof and/or excluded from
receiving materials with respect to such meeting if the Board of Managers as a
whole or any committee, as applicable, determines upon the reasonable advice
of counsel (i) that it is necessary to comply with applicable law or (ii)
there exists, with respect to the subject of a meeting or materials thereof,
an actual or potential conflict of interest between the Board of Managers,
such committee or the LLC, on the one hand, and such Manager, on the other
hand; _provided_ , that if the rights of such Manager to attend meetings or
receive such materials, as applicable, are limited pursuant to this _Section
7(h)_, the Board of Managers or such committee, as applicable, shall notify
such Manager of such limitation in writing as soon as reasonably practicable
and in advance of imposing such limitation and such notice shall provide (1) a
description of such limitation and the reasons therefor and (2) a reasonable
description of the applicable meeting or materials, as applicable, in a manner
that would comply with applicable law or not give rise to the applicable
conflict of interest, as applicable.

 



3 (h) _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of Managers may be
called by a majority of the Managers on at least twenty-four (24) hours
personal, written, wireless or electronic notice to each Manager, which notice
must include appropriate dial-in information to permit each Manager to
participate in such meeting by means of telephone conference, in accordance
with _Section 7(j)_.

(i) _Action Without a Meeting_. Any action required or permitted to be taken
at any meeting of the Board of Managers may be taken without a meeting if a
consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken shall be signed by
Managers representing the requisite number of votes that would be required to
take the applicable action at a meeting of the Board of Managers at which all
of the Managers were present, and, when so signed, such written consent shall
constitute the approval of the Board of Managers of such action, and notice of
any such action taken shall be provided to those Managers who have not
consented in writing promptly following the taking of such action.

(j)  _Telephonic Conference Meeting_. Subject to the requirement for notice
of meetings, members of the Board of Managers may participate in a meeting by
means of a telephone conference or similar communications equipment by means
of which all individuals participating in the meeting can hear each other,
and participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at
such meeting, except where a person participates in the meeting for the
express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground
that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and such person has
notified the other Managers at such meeting of such purpose.

 

(k) _Waiver of Notice Through Attendance_. Attendance of a Manager at any
meeting of the Board of Managers (including by telephone) shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except where such Manager attends the
meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any
business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and
notifies the other Managers at such meeting of such purpose.

(l) _Reliance on Books, Reports and Records_. Each Manager shall, in the
performance of his or her duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith
upon the books of account or reports made to the LLC by any of its Officers or
by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser selected with
reasonable care by the Board of Managers, or in relying in good faith upon
other records of the LLC.

(m) _Costs and Expenses_. All reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Managers in connection with their participation in
meetings of the Board of Managers (and committees thereof) shall be passed to
and borne by the LLC.

 

8\. _Delegation of Authority to Officers and Others_.

 

(a) The Board of Managers may appoint individuals to act as agents or officers
(each an " _Officer_ " and collectively, the " _Officers_ ") of the LLC with
such titles and authority as shall be delegated to such persons by the Board
of Managers from time to time.

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Officers shall have such
rights, powers, authority and responsibilities, general or specific, as may
be expressly delegated to them pursuant to this Agreement or as determined
from time to time by the Board of Managers. Officers shall be subject to
removal with or without cause at any time by the Board of Managers.

 



4 (c) Upon authorization by the Board of Managers, any Officer, acting
individually, on behalf of the LLC, is authorized to execute and deliver, any
and all agreements, deeds, instruments, receipts, certificates and other
documents, and to take all such other action as it may consider necessary or
advisable in connection with the purposes of the LLC or the management of any
entity for which the LLC serves as general partner, member, manager or other
officer, without any vote or consent of any other person or entity,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement. The Member
confirms that all determinations, decisions and actions made or taken by any
of the Officers in accordance with this Agreement (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the first sentence of this _Section 8(c)_) shall be
conclusive and absolutely binding upon the LLC, the Board of Managers and the
Member, and their respective successors, assigns and personal representatives.

(d) Persons dealing with the LLC are entitled to rely conclusively upon the
power and authority of the Officers as set forth in this Agreement. A
certificate of any Officer certifying that such individual is an Officer, to
the extent such individual was appointed by the Board of Managers pursuant to
this Agreement, shall be conclusive evidence that such individual is an
Officer, and such individuals actions as an Officer, to the extent taken in
accordance with this Agreement and the delegation of authority to such
individual by the Board of Managers, shall be authorized and binding on the
LLC.

9.  _Authorization_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the LLC
(on its own behalf and/or on behalf of any entity for which the LLC is the
general partner, member, manager or other officer) is authorized, and the

partner, member, manager or other officer), is hereby authorized to execute
and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, the aforementioned
agreements, deeds, receipts, certificates, filings and other documents,
without any consent of the Board of Managers, but such authorization shall
not be deemed a restriction on the power of the LLC or the Member acting
individually on behalf of the LLC, or any entity for which the LLC is the
general partner, member, manager or other officer, to enter into, and to
perform its obligations under, other agreements on behalf of the LLC (on its
own behalf and/or on behalf of any entity for which the LLC is the general
partner, member, manager or other officer). The Member may execute the
aforementioned agreements, deeds, receipts, certificates, filings and other
documents on behalf of the LLC (on its own behalf and/or on behalf of any

 



6  entity for which the LLC is the general partner, member, manager or other
officer) under any title, including without limitation "Authorized Person,"
that the Member deems appropriate. Any prior acts of the LLC (on its own
behalf and/or on behalf of any entity for which the LLC is the general
partner, member, manager or other officer), and the Board of Managers or the
Member acting individually on behalf of the LLC (on its own behalf and/or on
behalf of any entity for which the LLC is the general partner, member, manager

ratified and confirmed.

deem necessary or advisable in connection with the business of the LLC from
time to time.

LLC, including _Annex A_ , shall be maintained at the LLCs principal place
of business. The Member acknowledges and agrees that for so long as the LLC is
a domestic entity with a single owner (as determined under U.S. federal income
tax law, the Member), the LLC is intended to be

 



7  classified and treated as a disregarded entity separate from its single
owner for United States federal, state and local income tax purposes. The
LLCs books of account shall be maintained on a basis consistent with such
treatment and on the same basis utilized in preparing the Members United
States federal income tax returns. The Member and its duly authorized
representatives may, for any reason reasonably related to its interest as a
member of the LLC, examine the LLCs books of account and make copies and
extracts therefrom at its own expense. The records of the LLC shall be
maintained for three years following termination of the LLC.

 

(c) For so long as the LLC has a single owner (as determined under U.S.
federal income tax law, the Member), the Member hereby agrees to take any
measures necessary (or, if applicable, refrain from any action) to ensure that
the LLC is treated as a disregarded entity for United States federal, state
and local income tax purposes.

 

14\. _Assignments and Transfers of Interests_. The Member may, without the
consent of the Board of Managers, transfer all or any portion of its limited
liability company interest in the LLC and any and all rights and/or
obligations associated therewith to any person or entity at any time. The
transferee of an interest in the LLC shall be admitted to the LLC as a member
of the LLC upon its execution of a counterpart signature page to this
Agreement, or some other written instrument reasonably acceptable to the
Member in which it agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If the
transferring member of the LLC is the sole member of the LLC and transfers
all of its interest in the LLC, such admission shall be deemed effective
immediately prior to the transfer and immediately following such admission,
the transferor Member shall cease to be a member of the LLC. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, following the transfer of the Members entire
limited liability company interest in the LLC to a single transferee and the
admission of such transferee as a member of the Company, the definition "
_Member_ " shall be deemed to mean such transferee.

15\. _Admission and Withdrawal of Additional Members_. One or more additional
member(s) (each such member, an " _Additional Member_ " and collectively, the
" _Additional Members_ ") may, without the consent of the Board of Managers,
be admitted to the LLC with the written consent of the Member and any
Additional Member(s). Upon the admission to the LLC of any Additional
Member(s), if the LLC then has two or more members, the Member and the
Additional Member(s) shall cause this Agreement to be amended and restated to
reflect the admission of such newly admitted Additional Member(s) and the
initial capital contribution, if any, of such newly admitted Additional
Member(s); _provided_ , that in any event and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, the Member acting alone may cause this Agreement to be so amended
and restated. A member may resign from the LLC at any time by delivering
written notice of such resignation to the Board of Managers and the other
member(s) of the LLC. Such resignation shall take effect at the time
specified in such notice or, if the time be not specified, upon receipt
thereof by the other member(s) of the LLC. Unless otherwise specified therein,
acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

16\. _Liability of the Member_. The Member, in its capacity as a member of the
LLC, shall have no liability for the obligations or liabilities of the LLC or
any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates, except to the extent provided in
the Act and applicable law. Except as otherwise expressly provided in _Section
24_, nothing expressed in or implied by this Agreement shall be construed to
confer upon or to give any person, except the Member and, in discharging its
managerial duties hereunder, the Board of Managers, any rights or remedies
under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



8 17\. _Dissolution_.

 

(a) Subject to the occurrence of an event of dissolution pursuant to _Section
17(b)_, the LLC shall have perpetual existence.

 

(b) The LLC shall dissolve, and its affairs shall be wound up, upon the first
to occur of the following:

 

(i) the written consent of the Member,

 

(ii) at any time there is no member of the LLC unless the LLC is continued in
accordance with the Act, or

 

(iii) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under Section 18-802 of
the Act.

 

(c) In the event of dissolution, the LLC shall wind up its affairs (including
the sale of the assets of the LLC) in an orderly manner, and the assets of
the LLC shall be applied in the manner, and in the order of priority, set
forth in Section 18-804 of the Act. As part of the winding up process, any
amounts permitted to be distributed to the Member in accordance with Section
18-804 of the Act shall be distributed to the Member.

18\. _Exculpation; Indemnification and Insurance; Elimination of Fiduciary
Duties_.

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no former, current or
future member of the LLC, former, current or future Manager, any of their
respective affiliates, or any former, current or future direct or indirect
equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, affiliates (including any portfolio company), members,
financing sources, investors, managers, general or limited partners or
assignees of any of the foregoing (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ "), shall
be liable, responsible or accountable in damages or otherwise to the LLC, any
member of the LLC, any Manager, any Indemnified Person, any person or entity
who acquires an interest in the LLC or any other person or entity bound by
this Agreement, for any act or failure to act by such Indemnified Person
in connection with the conduct of the business of the LLC, or by any other
Indemnified Person in performing or participating in the performance of the
obligations of the LLC, so long as such Indemnified Person acted in the good
faith belief that such action or failure to act was in the best interests, or
not opposed to the best interests, of the LLC and its respective subsidiaries.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no person who is or was a
member of the LLC, a Manager, or a manager, director or officer of a Manager
or a direct or indirect officer, director, manager, employee, agent,
controlling person, affiliate (including any portfolio company), stockholder,
equity holder, financing source, investor, member, partner or assignee of any
member of the LLC, or any combination of the foregoing, shall be personally
liable under any judgment of a court, or in any other manner, for any debt,
obligation, or liability of the LLC or any of its respective subsidiaries
or other affiliates, whether that liability or obligation arises in contract,

 



9  tort, or otherwise, solely by reason of being a member of the LLC, a
Manager, or a manager, director or officer of a Manager or a direct or
indirect officer, director, manager, employee, agent, controlling person,
affiliate (including a portfolio company), stockholder, equity holder,
financing source, investor, member, partner or assignee of a member of the
LLC, or any combination of the foregoing.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 18(i)_, the LLC shall indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law
from and against any and all losses, claims, demands, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and amounts
paid in settlement and costs of investigation), judgments, fines, settlements
and other amounts, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquidated or
unliquidated, incurred by any such Indemnified Person arising out of,
resulting from or relating or incidental to any action, suit, claim, demand or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative to which
such Indemnified Person may be made a party or otherwise involved or with
which it shall be threatened by reason of its being an Indemnified Person, so
long as such Indemnified Person acted in the good faith belief that such
action or failure to act was in the best interests, or not opposed to the best
interests, of the LLC and its respective subsidiaries. Such attorneys fees
and expenses and costs of investigation shall be paid by the LLC as they are
incurred upon receipt, in each case, of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Person to repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification hereunder with
respect thereto.

(c) The right of an Indemnified Person to indemnification hereunder shall not
be exclusive of any other right or remedy that an Indemnified Person may have
pursuant to applicable law or this Agreement.

(d) An Indemnified Person shall be fully protected in relying in good faith
upon the records of the LLC and upon such information, opinions, reports or
statements presented to the LLC by any person or entity as to matters the
Indemnified Person reasonably believes are within such other persons
professional or expert competence and who has been selected by or on behalf of
the LLC, including information, opinions, reports or statements as to the
value and amount of the assets, liabilities, or any other facts pertinent
to the existence and amount of assets from which distributions to the Member
or any other member of the LLC might properly be paid.

(e) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnified Person has duties
(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the LLC, to
any member of the LLC, to any person or entity who acquires an interest in the
LLC or to any other person or entity bound by this Agreement, an Indemnified
Person acting within the scope of this Agreement shall not be liable to any of
the foregoing or to any other Indemnified Person for its good faith reliance
on the provisions of this Agreement or any approval or authorization granted
by the Member or the Board of Managers. The provisions of this Agreement, to
the extent that they restrict or eliminate the duties and liabilities of an
Indemnified Person otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the
Member and the Board of Managers to replace such other duties and liabilities
of such Indemnified Person.

 



10 (f) The foregoing provisions of this _Section 18_ shall (i) survive
any termination of this Agreement and (ii) be contract rights, and no
amendment, modification, supplement, restatement or repeal of this _Section
18_, without the consent of the applicable Indemnified Person(s), shall have
the effect of limiting or denying any such rights with respect to actions
giving rise to losses, claims, demands, damages, liabilities, costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and amounts paid
in settlement and costs of investigation) prior to any such amendment,
modification, supplementation or repeal.

(g) The LLC shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf
of any Indemnified Person or any person or entity who is or was an agent of
the LLC against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by
such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as
an agent, whether or not the LLC would have the power to indemnify such person
against such liability under the provisions of this _Section 18_ or under
applicable law.

 

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any duty
otherwise existing at law or in equity, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, (i) any Indemnified Person who is also an officer, director,
partner, employee, managing director or other affiliate of either Apollo
Management VIII, L.P., on behalf of its investment funds ("Apollo"), or any
of its respective affiliates (the " _Covered Managers_ "), as well as the
current Member and the affiliates of the Covered Managers (each of the
foregoing, a " _Covered Indemnified Person_ ") shall have no duty (fiduciary,
contractual or otherwise, whether at law or in equity) to the LLC, any member
of the LLC, any Manager, any person or entity who acquires an interest in the
LLC or to any other person or entity bound by this Agreement and all such
duties (fiduciary, contractual or otherwise, whether at law or in equity) are
hereby eliminated, in each case, other than the specific covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement or in any other agreement by which such
Covered Indemnified Person is expressly bound, (ii) in the event of any
conflict of interest between the LLC, on the one hand, and any Covered
Indemnified Person, on the other hand, a Covered Indemnified Person may act in
its best interest, (iii) no Covered Indemnified Person shall be obligated to
(A) disclose or reveal to the LLC any confidential information belonging to or
relating to the business of such Covered Indemnified Person or any of its
affiliates or (B) recommend or take any action in its capacity as a member of
the LLC, Manager, Officer or otherwise, as the case may be, that prefers the
interest of the LLC over the interest of such Covered Indemnified Person or
its affiliates and (iv) the LLC, each member of the LLC, each Manager, each
other person or entity who acquires an interest in the LLC and each other
person or entity bound by this Agreement irrevocably, unconditionally and
absolutely waives and agrees not to assert any claim or cause of
action against each Covered Indemnified Person that may from time to time
arise in respect of a breach by any such Covered Indemnified Person of any
duty or obligation disclaimed under this _Section 18(h)_ or _Section 19_.
The elimination of duties (including fiduciary, contractual or otherwise
whether at law or in equity) of the Covered Indemnified Persons to the LLC,
each member of the LLC, each of the Managers, each other person or entity who
acquires an interest in the LLC and each other person or entity bound by this
Agreement and replacement thereof with the duties or standards expressly set
forth herein, if any, are approved by the Member, each of the Managers, each
other person or entity who acquires an interest in the LLC and each other
person or entity bound by this Agreement. The provisions of this _Section
18(h)_, to the extent that they restrict or eliminate the duties and
liabilities of any Covered Indemnified Person otherwise existing at law or in
equity, are intended to replace such other duties and liabilities to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

 



11 (i) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement or in any agreement contemplated herein or
applicable provisions of law or equity or otherwise, whenever in this
Agreement any member of the LLC or the Board of Managers is permitted or
required to make a decision (i) in its "discretion", "sole discretion", "sole
and absolute discretion" or under a grant of similar authority or latitude,
such member of the LLC or the Board of Managers, as applicable, shall be
entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires, including
its own interests or the interests of any other person or entity, and shall
have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or
factors affecting the LLC, any member of the LLC or any other person or
entity, or (ii) under any express standard, such member of the LLC and the
Board of Managers shall act under such express standard, shall not be subject
to any other or different standard imposed by applicable law or equity or
otherwise, and may exercise its discretion differently with respect to
different members of the LLC. Unless otherwise expressly stated, each member
of the LLC and the Board of Managers shall be deemed to be permitted or
required to make all decisions or determinations hereunder in its sole
discretion. The foregoing is in furtherance, and not in limitation, of the
elimination of duties (fiduciary, contractual or otherwise, whether at law or
in equity) set forth in clause (i) above. 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, under no circumstances shall any
employee of the LLC or any of its subsidiaries be deemed to be an Indemnified
Person or a Covered Indemnified Person, irrespective of whether such employee
is a manager, director or officer of the LLC or any of its subsidiaries, and
the preceding provisions of this _Section 18_ shall not result in or be
deemed to result in a limitation or elimination of any duty (contractual,
fiduciary or otherwise, whether at law or in equity) owed by any such
employee. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, the rights to indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses
conferred upon any Indemnified Person (other than the current Member) in
office immediately prior to the effectiveness of this Agreement (" _Prior
Indemnified Persons_ "), as well as any waiver, elimination, limitation, or
modification of duties (contractual, fiduciary or otherwise, whether at law or
in equity) of any Prior Indemnified Person set forth in this Agreement, shall
not apply with respect to any act or omission taken or omitted to be taken by
such Prior Indemnified Person before the effectiveness of this Agreement;
provided that the obligations of the LLC with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of liabilities of the Prior
Indemnified Persons set forth in the Fifth Amended and Restated Limited
Liability Company Agreement, dated June 5, 2013, of the LLC shall apply with
respect to acts or omissions of the Prior Indemnified Persons at or prior to
the effectiveness of this Agreement.

19\. _Competitive Opportunity_.

 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and notwithstanding any
other duty (contractual, fiduciary or otherwise, whether at law or in
equity), and in furtherance, and not in limitation, of the elimination of
duties (contractual, fiduciary or otherwise, whether at law or in equity) set
forth in _Section 18(h)_ above, any Covered Indemnified Person (i)
shall have the right to, and shall have no duty (contractual, fiduciary or
otherwise, whether at law or in

 



12  equity) not to, directly or indirectly engage in and possess interests in
other business ventures of every type and description, including those engaged
in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as the LLC,
any member of the LLC or any of their respective subsidiaries or other
affiliates or the foregoings direct or indirect equity holders or deemed to
be competing with the LLC, any member of the LLC or any of their respective
subsidiaries or other affiliates or the foregoings direct or indirect equity
holders, on its own account, or in partnership with, or as a direct or
indirect equity holder, controlling person, stockholder, director,
officer, employee, agent, affiliate (including any portfolio company),
member, financing source, investor, manager, general or limited partner or
assignee of any other person or entity with no obligation to offer to the LLC,
any member of the LLC or any of their respective subsidiaries or other
affiliates or the foregoings direct or indirect equity holders the right to
participate therein and (ii) shall have the right to invest in, or provide
services to, any person or entity that directly or indirectly competes with
the LLC, any member of the LLC or any of the foregoings respective
subsidiaries or other affiliates or the foregoings direct or indirect equity
holders.

 

(b) In the event that any Covered Indemnified Person acquires knowledge of a
potential transaction or matter which may be an investment, corporate or
business opportunity or prospective economic or competitive advantage in which
the LLC, any member of the LLC or their respective subsidiaries or other
affiliates, or the foregoings direct or indirect equity holders could have
an interest or expectancy (contractual, equitable or otherwise) (a "
_Competitive Opportunity_ ") or otherwise is then exploiting any Competitive
Opportunity, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and
notwithstanding any other duty existing at law or in equity, and in
furtherance, and not in limitation, of the elimination of duties (contractual,
fiduciary or otherwise, whether at law or in equity) set forth in _Section
18(h)_ above, the LLC, any member of the LLC and their respective
subsidiaries and other affiliates, and the foregoings direct and indirect
equity holders will have no interest in, and no expectation (contractual,
equitable or otherwise) that, such Competitive Opportunity be offered to it.
Any such interest or expectation (contractual, equitable or otherwise) is
hereby renounced so that such Covered Indemnified Person shall (i) have no
duty to communicate or present such Competitive Opportunity to the LLC,
any member of the LLC or their respective subsidiaries or other affiliates or
the foregoings direct or indirect equity holders, (ii) have the right to
either hold any such Competitive Opportunity for such Covered Indemnified
Persons own account and benefit or the account of the former, current or
future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, members, financing
sources, investors, managers, general or limited partners or assignees of any
Covered Indemnified Person or to direct, recommend, assign or otherwise
transfer such Competitive Opportunity to persons or entities other than the
LLC, any member of the LLC or any of their respective subsidiaries, other
affiliates or direct or indirect equity holders and (iii) notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, not be obligated or liable to the
LLC, any member of the LLC, any other person or entity bound by this
Agreement or any of the foregoings former, current or future direct or
indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, affiliates (including portfolio companies),
members, financing sources, investors, managers, general or limited partners
or assignees of any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") or
any other person or entity by reason of the fact that such Covered Indemnified
Person, directly or indirectly, took any of the actions noted in the
immediately preceding clause (ii), pursued or acquired such Competitive
Opportunity for itself or any other person or entity or failed to communicate
or present such Competitive Opportunity to the LLC, any member of the LLC or
their respective subsidiaries, other affiliates or direct or indirect equity
holders.

 



13 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, under no circumstances
shall the provisions of this _Section 19_ (other than this clause (c)) apply
to (or result in or be deemed to result in a limitation or elimination of any
duty (contractual, fiduciary or otherwise, whether at law or in equity) owed
by) any employee of the LLC or any of its respective subsidiaries,
irrespective of whether such employee is otherwise a Representative, or any
Prior Indemnified Person, and any Competitive Opportunity waived or renounced
by any person or entity pursuant to such other provisions of this _Section
19_ shall be expressly reserved and maintained by such person or entity (and
shall not be waived or renounced) as to any such person.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 19_, to the extent that they restrict or
eliminate the duties and liabilities of any former, current or future member
of the LLC, Manager or their respective Representatives otherwise existing at
law or in equity, are intended to replace such other duties and liabilities to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. For the avoidance of doubt,
this _Section 19_ is intended to disclaim and renounce, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any right of the LLC, any member of the LLC, each
of the Managers, each other person or entity who acquires an interest in the
LLC and each of its respective subsidiaries and other affiliates and direct or
indirect equity holders with respect to the matters set forth in this _Section
19_, and this _Section 19_ shall be construed to effect such disclaimer and
renunciation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

20\. _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied
in this Agreement and notwithstanding the fact that a member or manager of the
LLC may be a partnership, limited liability company, corporation or other
entity, no recourse under this Agreement or any documents or instruments
delivered by any person or entity pursuant hereto shall be had against any of
the LLCs, any member of the LLCs, any Managers, or any of the foregoings
respective affiliates former, current or future direct or indirect equity
holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, Affiliates, members, financing sources, managers, general or limited
partners or assignees (each a " _Related Party_ " and collectively, the "
_Related Parties_ "), in each case other than (subject, for the avoidance of
doubt, to the provisions of this Agreement (as may be amended, restated or
modified from time to time), dated as of the date hereof) the LLC, a member
of the LLC, any Manager, or any of their respective assignees under this
Agreement, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any applicable law, it being expressly
agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach
to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any of the Related Parties, as
such, for any obligation or liability of the LLC, any member of the LLC or any
Manager under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered by any
person or entity pursuant hereto for any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of such obligations or liabilities or their creation; _provided_ ,
however, that nothing in this  _Section 20_ shall relieve or otherwise limit
the liability of the LLC, any member of the LLC, or any Manager, as such, for
any breach or violation of its obligations under such agreements, documents or
instruments.

 



14 21\. _Amendments_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in the
Act, this Agreement may only be amended by a written document, instrument or
other writing, executed by the Member.

22\. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
parties hereto and their respective successors, executors, administrators,
legal representatives, heirs and legal assigns and shall inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and, except as otherwise provided herein, their
respective successors, executors, administrators, legal representatives, heirs
and legal assigns.

23.  _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
under, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles
of conflicts of laws, and all rights and remedies shall be governed by said
laws. The provisions of the Act shall control as to any matters not set forth
in this Agreement.

24\. _No Benefit of Third Parties_. Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement are intended only for the
regulation of relations among the Member, the Board of Managers and former or
future members of the LLC. This Agreement is not intended for the benefit of
or to be enforceable by any person or entity other than the Member, the Board
of Managers, and former or future members of the LLC, their respective heirs,
executors, administrators, successors and assigns and, with respect to 
_Section 18_ (Indemnification) only, Indemnified Persons, with respect to
_Section 19_ (Competitive Opportunity) only, Representatives and, with
respect to _Section 20_ (No Recourse) only, Related Parties. The
covenants and agreements contained herein shall be binding upon and, except
as provided in _Sections 18_ , _19_ and _20_ , inure only to the benefit of
the Member, the Board of Managers, and their respective heirs, executors,
administrators, successors and assigns.

25\. _Manager Insurance_. The LLC shall or shall cause to purchase or
otherwise maintain reasonable and customary insurance on behalf of any person
who is or was a Manager against any liability asserted against such person and
incurred by such person in any such capacity or arising out of such persons
status as a Manager.

 

26\. _Separability of Provisions_. Each provision of this Agreement shall be
considered separable, and if for any reason any provision or provisions
herein are determined to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal under any
existing or future law, such invalidity, unenforceability or illegality shall
not impair the operation of or affect those portions of this Agreement
that are valid, enforceable and legal.

27\. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic signature. All
counterparts shall be construed together and shall constitute one instrument.
