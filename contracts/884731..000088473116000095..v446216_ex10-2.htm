Article 2 
 THE TRANSACTION

  



  

 _Section 2.1_ _Sale and Purchase of Shares_. In accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Seller will sell and
transfer to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser will purchase and acquire from
the Seller, all of the Shares, free and clear of all Claims (other than any
restrictions on transferability imposed by applicable securities Laws).

  



    

Portions of this Exhibit, indicated by the mark "[***]," were omitted and have

 _Section 2.2_ _Purchase Price_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, in consideration for the sale of
the Shares, the Purchaser will pay to the Seller an aggregate amount in cash
equal to US Dollars 140,000,000 (the " _Initial Purchase Price_ "), as
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.3 (the " _Closing Date Payment_ "). The Closing
Date Payment is subject to adjustment following the Closing pursuant to
Section 2.4. The Initial Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.3
and Section 2.4(f) will be the " _Purchase Price_ ".

  



  

 _Section 2.3_ _Closing Date Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) _Estimated Closing Net Cash_. No later than two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Seller will provide to the Purchaser an
estimate of the Closing Net Cash (such estimate, the " _Estimated Closing Net
Cash_ "). To the extent the Estimated Closing Net Cash is positive ( _i.e._ ,
the Closing Cash exceeds the Closing Indebtedness), the Purchaser will add the
absolute value of such amount to the Initial Purchase Price paid at the
Closing. To the extent the Estimated Closing Net Cash is negative ( _i.e._
, the Closing Indebtedness exceeds the Closing Cash), the Purchaser will
deduct the absolute value of such amount from the Initial Purchase Price paid
at the Closing.

  



  

(b) _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_. No later than two
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller will provide to the
Purchaser an estimate of the Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital_ "). If the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital
is greater than zero, the Purchaser will add the absolute value of the excess
to the Initial Purchase Price paid at the Closing. If the Estimated Closing
Net Working Capital is less than zero, the Purchaser will deduct the
absolute value of the shortfall from the Initial Purchase Price paid at the
Closing.

  



  

 _Section 2.4_ _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) Within 45 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will
prepare and deliver to the Seller a written notice (the " _Adjustment Notice_
") containing (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired
Companies as at immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Closing Balance
Sheet_ "), (ii) the Purchaser's calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital based on the Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Closing Net
Working Capital Statement_ "), (iii) the Purchaser's calculation of Closing
Net Cash based on the Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Closing Net Cash
Statement_ ") and (iv) the Purchaser's calculation of the amount of any
payments required pursuant to Section 2.4(g) (the " _Adjustment Calculation_
"). The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and
the Closing Net Cash Statement will be prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied in a manner consistent with the methods and practices used to prepare
the Company Interim Balance Sheet.

  



  

(b) During the preparation of the Adjustment Notice, at the
Purchaser's request, the Seller will, and will cause each of the
Acquired Companies to, (i) provide the Purchaser and the Purchaser's
Representatives with reasonable access to the books, records, facilities and
Employees of the Acquired Companies to the extent not otherwise already
acquired as of the Closing Date, (ii) provide the Purchaser, within ten
Business Days after the Closing Date, with normal month-end closing financial
information for the period ending as of the close of business on the Closing
Date and (iii) reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser and the
Purchaser's Representatives, including by providing on a timely basis all
information reasonably necessary or useful in preparing the Adjustment Notice
and any other information reasonably requested by the Purchaser. Following
delivery of the Adjustment Notice, at the Seller's request, the Purchaser (i)
shall reasonably cooperate and assist, and shall cause its Representatives to
assist, the Seller and its Representatives in the review of the Adjustment
Notice and (ii) shall provide the Seller and its Representatives with any
information reasonably requested by them.

11 

 



    



  

(c) Within 30 days after delivery of the Adjustment Notice, the
Seller will either:

  



  

(i) agree in writing with the Adjustment Calculation, in which case
such calculation will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of
Section 2.4(g); or

  



  

(ii) dispute the Adjustment Calculation by delivering to the
Purchaser a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") which shall specify which
items are being disputed and set forth in reasonable detail the basis for each
disputed item therein.

  



  

(d) If the Seller fails to take either of the foregoing actions
within 30 days after delivery of the Adjustment Notice, then the Seller will
be deemed to have irrevocably accepted the Adjustment Calculation, in which
case, the Adjustment Calculation will be final and binding on the parties for
purposes of Section 2.4(g).

  



  

(e) If the Seller timely delivers a Dispute Notice to the Purchaser,
then the Purchaser and the Seller will attempt in good faith, for a period of
30 days following the Purchaser's receipt of such Dispute Notice (the "
_Resolution Period_ "), to agree on the Adjustment Calculation for purposes
of Section 2.4(g). Any resolution by the Purchaser and the Seller
memorialized in writing and signed by both the Purchaser and the Seller
during the Resolution Period as to any disputed items set forth in
such Dispute Notice will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of
Section 2.4(g). If the Purchaser and the Seller do not resolve all disputed
items by the end of the Resolution Period, then the Purchaser and the Seller
will submit the remaining items in dispute to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for
resolution, or if that firm is unwilling or unable to serve, the Purchaser and
the Seller will engage another mutually agreeable independent accounting firm
of recognized international standing, which firm is not the regular auditing
firm of the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies. If the Purchaser and the
Seller are unable to jointly select such independent accounting firm within
10 days after the Resolution Period, the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Seller, on the other hand, will each select an independent accounting firm of
recognized international standing and such selected accounting firms will
select a third independent accounting firm of recognized international
standing, which firm is not the regular auditing firm of the Purchaser or the
Acquired Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that if either the Purchaser, on
the one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand, fails to select such
independent accounting firm during this 10-day period, then the parties agree
that the independent accounting firm selected by the other party will be the
independent accounting firm selected by the parties for purposes of this
Section 2.4 (such selected independent accounting firm, whether pursuant to
this sentence or the preceding sentence, the " _Independent Accounting Firm_
").

  



  

(i) The Independent Accounting Firm will (A) act as an expert in
accounting, and not as an arbitrator, to resolve only those items
specifically set forth on a timely delivered Dispute Notice that remain in
dispute as of such time, and that have not been deemed pursuant to Section
2.4(c), Section 2.4(d) or Section 2.4(e) to be final and binding on the
Parties, (B) render its determination in accordance with this Agreement and
otherwise in accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the
methods and practices used to prepare the Company Interim Balance Sheet, (C)
not determine an Adjustment Calculation that would result in a Purchase Price
(1) in excess of the applicable amount in the Adjustment Notice or (2) that
is less than the applicable amount in the Dispute Notice and (D) render its
determination with respect to the items in dispute in a written report that
specifies the conclusions of the Independent Accounting Firm as to each item
in dispute and the resulting Adjustment Calculation. The Independent
Accounting Firm will only render its determination with respect to the
specific remaining accounting differences submitted to it and may rely
only upon information submitted to it by or on behalf of the Purchaser or the
Seller. The Purchaser and the Seller will each use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to render its

(c) The Seller and the Purchaser will promptly notify the other of
any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and will permit the other party to review in advance any proposed

with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and
in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods under any
Antitrust Laws. The Seller and the Purchaser will provide each other with

Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 5.4_ _Financing_. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser expressly acknowledges and
agrees that the Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement are not
conditioned in any manner whatsoever upon the Purchaser obtaining
any financing and any failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
arising from the failure of the Purchaser to obtain financing or the
unavailability of such financing will be deemed to be intentional for purposes
of this Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 5.5_ _Public Announcements_. Each party agrees not to
issue any press release or make any other public announcement relating to this
Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party, except that
each of the Seller and the Purchaser reserves the right, without the other
party's prior consent, to make any public disclosure it believes in good faith
is required by applicable securities Laws or securities listing standards (in
which case the disclosing party agrees to consult with the other party
prior to making the disclosure and allow the other party reasonable time to
comment thereon prior to issuance or release; provided, that, the disclosing
party will consider the other party's comments in good faith, but it is not
required to accept all comments). Following execution and delivery of this

substantially in the form set forth in _Exhibit C_.

period ending March 31, 2016 (the " _Other Consolidated Financial Statements_

Act. The Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
necessary auditor reports and consents from the Seller's independent auditors
required by the SEC to file such Audited Consolidated Financial Statements
and Other Consolidated Financial Statements with the SEC. The fees, costs and
expenses incurred by the Seller or its Affiliates in connection with the
delivery of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and any auditor
reports or consents required pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall reduce
dollar-for-dollar the amount of the current liabilities of the Acquired
Companies for the purposes of calculating Closing Net Working Capital.

  



  

 _Section 5.9_ _CSC Guarantee_. The Purchaser and the Seller will
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide financial assurances
reasonably acceptable to CSC in substitution of the CSC Guarantee or to
otherwise obtain the full release of the CSC Guarantee, in each case at or
prior to the Closing. In the event that the CSC Guarantee is not substituted
or released at or prior to the Closing, (a) the Purchaser and the Seller will
continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide financial
assurances reasonably acceptable to CSC in substitution of the CSC Guarantee
or to otherwise obtain the full release of the CSC Guarantee as promptly as
practicable and (b) until such time as the CSC Guarantee is substituted or
released, the Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its
Affiliates (including ARIAD US) against and from any and all Liabilities
arising out of or relating to CSC Guarantee.

the knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement by the other party or
because one or more of the conditions to the terminating party's

Article 8 
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

 _Section 8.1_ _Indemnification by the Seller_. If the Closing
occurs, and subject to the limitations expressly set forth in Section 8.4 and
Section 8.5, the Seller will indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser and
its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, stockholders and
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against any and all Losses (other than Losses with respect to Taxes, for
which the provisions of Section 9.2 will govern) incurred by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties arising or resulting from (a) any breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in Article 3, (b) any breach of any
covenant of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, (c) any Indebtedness
to the extent not taken into account in the determination of the Final
Closing Net Cash and (d) the Deferred Refund Obligations. The amount of
indemnified Losses will be determined without regard to any "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" qualification contained in the applicable
provisions hereof.

  



  

 _Section 8.2_ _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. If the Closing
occurs, and subject to the limitations expressly set forth in Section 8.4 and
Section 8.5, the Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and
its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, stockholders and
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against any and all Losses (other than Losses with respect to Taxes, for
which the provisions of Section 9.2(b) will govern) incurred by the Seller
Indemnified Parties arising or resulting from (a) any breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in Article 4 and (b) any breach of any
covenant of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement. The amount of
indemnified Losses will be determined without regard to any "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" qualification contained in the applicable provisions
hereof.

  



  

 _Section 8.3_ _Claim Procedure_. 

  



  

(a) A party that seeks indemnity under this Article 8 (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") will give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the
party from whom indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
whether the Losses sought arise from matters solely between the parties or
from Third Party Claims described in Section 8.3(b). The Claim Notice
must contain (i) a description and, if known, the estimated amount of any
Losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified
Party, (ii) a reasonable explanation, accompanied by reasonable supporting
documentation, of the basis for the Claim Notice to the extent of the facts
then known by the Indemnified Party and (iii) a demand for payment of those
Losses.

  



  

(b) If the Indemnified Party seeks indemnity under this Article 8 in
response to a claim or Proceeding by another Person not a party to this
Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), then the Indemnified Party will give a
Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party within ten days after the Indemnified
Party has received notice or otherwise learns of the assertion of such Third
Party Claim and will include in the

  



    

Portions of this Exhibit, indicated by the mark "[***]," were omitted and have
been filed separately with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Registrant's application
requesting confidential treatment 
pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
--- 

33 

 



    



  

Claim Notice (i) the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party Claim
and the amount of the damages claimed by the other Person, in each case to
the extent known to the Indemnified Party, accompanied by reasonable
supporting documentation submitted by such third party (to the extent then in
the possession of the Indemnified Party) and (ii) the assertion of the claim
or the notice of the commencement of any Proceeding relating to such Third
Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay or deficiency on the
part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party will
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability under this Agreement except
to the extent such delay or deficiency prejudices or otherwise adversely
affects the rights of the Indemnifying Party with respect thereto.

  



  

(c) The Indemnifying Party will have 30 days after receipt of notice
of such Third Party Claim to elect to assume control of the defense of such
Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party by giving to the Indemnified Party written notice of the intention to
assume control of such defense. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume
control of such defense, the Indemnified Party will control such defense.

  



  

(d) The party not controlling the defense of the Third Party Claim
(the " _Non-controlling Party_ ") may participate in the defense thereof at
its own expense. However, if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such
defense as permitted above and, based upon the reasonable opinion of counsel
to the Indemnified Party reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, a
conflict or potential conflict of interest exists between the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party which makes the representation of both
parties inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, then
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party will be
considered and included as "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement. The Non-
controlling Party will furnish the party controlling the defense of the Third
Party Claim (the " _Controlling Party_ ") with such information as it may
have with respect to the Third Party Claim (including copies of any summons,
complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any
written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or
asserting the same) and will otherwise cooperate with and assist the
Controlling Party and its counsel in the defense of such Third Party Claim.
The Controlling Party will keep the Non-controlling Party reasonably advised
of the status of such Third Party Claim and will consider in good faith
recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect thereto.

  



  

(e) The Indemnifying Party will not agree to any settlement of, or
consent to the entry of any Judgment (other than a Judgment of dismissal on
the merits without costs) arising from, any such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the consent of the Indemnified Party will not be required if the
Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to
such settlement or any Judgment and such settlement or Judgment includes a
full, complete and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from
further Liability. The Indemnified Party will not agree to any settlement of,
or the entry of any Judgment (other than a Judgment of dismissal on the merits
without costs) arising from, any such Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

 _Section 8.4_ _Survival_. Other than the Seller Fundamental
Representations and the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.13 ( _Tax Matters_ ), all representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement will survive the Closing until the twelve-month anniversary of
the Closing Date. The Seller Fundamental Representations and the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.13 ( _Tax Matters_
) will survive the Closing until sixty days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations. None of the covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date other than those
which by their terms contemplate performance after the Closing Date, and each
such surviving covenant and agreement shall survive the Closing for the period
contemplated by its terms or in accordance with the applicable statute of
limitations with respect thereto, whichever is shorter.

  



    

Portions of this Exhibit, indicated by the mark "[***]," were omitted and have

34 

 



    



  

All claims for indemnification under this Agreement must be asserted pursuant
to a Claim Notice given prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period set forth in this Section 8.4; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
representation, warranty or covenant that is the subject of a claim for
indemnification which is asserted pursuant to a Claim Notice given after the
Closing Date within the survival period specified in this Section 8.4 will
survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of such claim.

  



  

 _Section 8.5_ _Limitations on Liability_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement:

  



  

(i) no indemnification payments will be made by or on behalf of an
Indemnifying Party in respect of any breaches of representations
and warranties made by such party, as applicable, under this Agreement (other
than with respect to Seller Fundamental Representations) until the aggregate
amount of Losses for which such Indemnifying Party would (but for this clause)
be liable thereunder exceeds 1% of the Initial Purchase Price, in which event
the Indemnifying Party will be liable for all Losses from the first dollar;

  



  

(ii) the aggregate total amount for which an Indemnifying Party will
be liable to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties with respect
to any breaches of representations and warranties made by the Indemnifying
Party under this Agreement (other than with respect to Seller Fundamental
Representations) will not exceed 10% of the Initial Purchase Price;

  



  

(iii) the aggregate total amount for which an Indemnifying Party will
be liable to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties under this
Agreement will not exceed the Initial Purchase Price; and

  



  

(iv) any indemnity provided hereunder shall be so applied as to avoid
any double counting and no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to obtain
indemnification more than once for the same matter or Losses.

  



  

(b) An Indemnified Party's right to indemnification or other
remedies based upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreement
of the Indemnifying Party contained in this Agreement will not be affected or
deemed waived by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party, based solely
upon its own investigation and without regard to any information provided by
the Indemnifying Party, knew or should have known that any representation or
warranty might be inaccurate or that the Indemnifying Party filed to comply
with any agreement or covenant.

  



  

The limitations on liability set forth in this Section 8.5 shall not apply to
Losses resulting from fraud with respect to any breach of any
representation or warranty or willful breach with respect to any covenant, in
each case as contained in this Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 8.6_ _Tax Refunds, Insurance Proceeds and Other
Payments_. The amount of any and all Losses for which indemnification is
provided pursuant to this Article 8 or Article 9 will be net of any Tax
benefit to which an Indemnified Party is entitled by reason of payment
of such Liability and any amounts of any insurance proceeds, indemnification
payments, contribution payments or reimbursements receivable by, or payable
in kind to, the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto. In connection therewith, if, at any time
following payment in full by the Indemnifying Party of any amounts of Losses
due under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party receives any insurance
proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or
reimbursements relating to

  



    

Portions of this Exhibit, indicated by the mark "[***]," were omitted and have
been filed separately with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Registrant's application
requesting confidential treatment 
pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
--- 

35 

 



    



  

the circumstances giving rise to such Losses, the Indemnified Party will
promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party such proceeds, payments or
reimbursements in an amount not to exceed the amount of the corresponding
indemnification payment made by the Indemnifying Party. The Purchaser will
use (and will cause its Affiliates to use) commercially reasonable efforts to
collect the proceeds of any available insurance which would have the effect
of reducing any Losses (in which case the net proceeds thereof will reduce the
Losses).

  



  

 _Section 8.7_ _Subrogation_. If the Purchaser or any Purchaser
Indemnified Party is indemnified for any Losses pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to any claim by a Person not party to this Agreement, then the
Seller will be subrogated to all rights and remedies of the Purchaser or the
Purchaser Indemnified Party against such third party, and the Purchaser will,
and will cause each of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to, cooperate with
and assist the Seller in asserting all such rights and remedies against such
third party.

  



  

 _Section 8.8_ _Exclusive Remedy_ From and after the Closing,
except for the availability of injunctive or other equitable relief and claims
relating to fraud, the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser for any
matter arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be
pursuant to the indemnification obligations set forth in Article 8 and Article
9 and, except to the extent the Purchaser has asserted a claim for
indemnification by giving a Claim Notice in accordance with Section 8.3 prior
to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in Section 8.4,
the Purchaser will have no remedy against the Seller for any breach of
any provision of this Agreement. In no event will the Seller have any
Liability for Losses arising from the conduct of the business of the Acquired
Companies after the Closing.

  



  

Article 9 
 TAX MATTERS

  



  

 _Section 9.1_ _Swiss Tax Rulings._

  



  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within thirty
days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Seller shall

(b) The Seller and the Purchaser will each use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the

and be responsible for the filing of the Swiss Tax Rulings and the submission
of any information, documentation, responses or communication with the Swiss
Tax Authority relating thereto. The parties will provide to each other such
assistance, information and cooperation as is reasonably required to obtain
the Swiss Tax Rulings (including providing necessary information, assisting
in responding to any inquiries and attending meetings with the applicable
Swiss Tax Authority) and, in connection therewith, each party will (i)
promptly notify the other party of any material communication between such
party and any Swiss Tax Authority relating to the Swiss Tax Rulings; (ii)
consult with the other party in advance of participating in any meeting or
discussion with any Swiss Tax Authority relating to the Swiss Tax Rulings
and, to the extent permitted by such Swiss Tax Authority, give the other
party (and its counsel and tax advisors) the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat; and (iii) subject to applicable Law, discuss with and
permit the other party (and its counsel and tax advisors) to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the other party's reasonable comments in
connection with, any proposed filing, submission or

communication to any Swiss Tax Authority relating to the Swiss Tax Rulings.
For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 9.1(b)
shall govern with respect to the interactions of the parties with the Swiss
Tax Authority in connection with the Swiss Tax Ruling and Section 5.3(c) will
not apply to the matters addressed in this Section 9.1(b).

  



  

 _Section 9.2_ _Liability and Indemnification for Taxes._

  



  

(a) If the Closing occurs, and subject to Section 8.5(a)(iii) and
the limitations expressly set forth in Section 9.2(d), and except to the

Losses for all Taxes of the Acquired Companies that are attributable to the
Pre-Closing Period or as a result of the Pre-Sale Restructuring or Carve-out
Restructuring, and (ii) all Losses for all Taxes attributable to any breach
of the Company's representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.13.

  



  

(b) If the Closing occurs, the Purchaser will indemnify the Seller
Indemnified Parties against all Losses (i) for all Taxes of the
Acquired Companies that are attributable to any Post-Closing Period, except

the Company's representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.13 and
(ii) for all Taxes arising solely out of or due to any breach of any covenant
of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

(c) With respect to any Straddle Period, any Losses for Taxes will
be allocated between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period by
closing the books of the Acquired Companies at the end of the Closing Date,
except that (i) Tax items of a periodic nature, such as property taxes or
depreciation allowances calculated on an annual basis, will be allocated by
apportioning a pro-rata portion of such Taxes to each day in the relevant
Straddle Period, and (ii) Liabilities relating to Tax associated with the Pre-
Sale Restructuring will fall into the Pre-Closing Period.

  



  

(d) The Seller will not be required to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for reductions in any Tax Attributes. The Seller will not
be required to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties against Losses for

Carve-out Restructuring to the extent such Losses for Taxes could be reduced
under applicable Law by reason of net operating loss carryovers, Tax credits
and similar Tax attributes arising in the Pre-Closing Period (assuming for

(d) If the Purchaser receives notice of a Tax Contest with respect
to any Acquired Company which could reasonably be expected to cause the
Seller to have an indemnification obligation under this Article 9, then the
Purchaser will notify the Seller in writing of such Tax Contest within five
Business Days of receiving such notice. The Seller will have the right to
control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Seller may decline to participate in such Tax
Contest. If the Seller controls the conduct of such Tax Contest, the Seller
will not resolve such Tax Contest, to the extent such Tax Contest relates to
Post-Closing Period Taxes, without the Purchaser's written consent, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the
Seller declines to control such Tax Contest, then the Purchaser will have the
right to control the conduct of such Tax Contest; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Purchaser will not resolve such Tax Contest without the Seller's
written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Each party will bear its own costs for participating in such Tax
Contest.

  



  

(e) Any net refunds and credits attributable to the payment of Taxes
for a Pre-Closing Period will be for the account of the Seller, and the
Purchaser will promptly pay to the Seller any such refund or credit.

Section 9.3, the procedures of Article 8 will apply in the case of any claim
for Losses related to Taxes.

Purchaser agree that it will:

  



  

(a) provide assistance to the other party as reasonably requested in
preparing and filing Tax Returns and responding to Tax Contests;

  



  

(b) make available to the other party as reasonably requested all
information, records, and documents relating to Taxes concerning the
Acquired Companies; and

  



  

(c) retain any books and records that could reasonably be expected
to be necessary or useful in connection with any preparation by any
other party of any Tax Return or for any Tax Contest or other examination or
Proceeding relating to Taxes. Such books and records will be retained until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including extensions
thereof). Thereafter, the Purchaser will not dispose of any such Tax Returns,
books and records unless it first offers in writing such Tax Returns, books
and records to the Seller and the Seller fails to accept such offer within 60
days of it being made.

  



  

 _Section 9.5_ _No Code Section 338 Election_. Neither the
Purchaser, the Company, nor any of their Affiliates will make any election
under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 9.6_ _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any
indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes unless otherwise required by applicable
Tax Law. Each party shall notify the other party if it receives notice that
any Governmental Authority proposes to treat any indemnification payment as
other than an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, or if it
otherwise determines that an indemnification payment is required by applicable
Tax Law to be treated as other than an adjustment to the Purchase Price for
Tax purposes.

Article 10 
 EMPLOYEE MATTERS

  



  

 _Section 10.1_ _Employees_. 

  



  

(a) For the one-year period commencing on the Closing Date (or such
longer period as may be required by applicable Law) (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), the Purchaser will provide, or cause the Acquired
Companies to provide, those employees employed by any Acquired Company at
Closing, including those employees on vacation, leave of absence, disability
(including long-term disability), military, parental or sick leave or layoff
(whether or not such employees return to active employment with the Acquired
Company) (the " _Transferred Employees_ "), with employee benefits that in
the aggregate are substantially equivalent to, and no less favorable
than, those provided to such Transferred Employees immediately prior to the
Closing, subject to any variations agreed with such Transferred Employees.
During the Continuation Period or such longer period as may be required under
the terms of any applicable employee benefit plan or arrangement, the
Purchaser will continue to provide, or cause the Acquired Companies to
provide, those former employees of any Acquired Company who left employment
prior to the Closing and who retain a benefit in any applicable Company Plan
(the " _Transferred Former Employees_ ") and their dependents, beneficiaries
and join annuitants, with employee/retiree benefits that in the aggregate are
substantially equivalent to, and no less favorable than, the benefits to which
such Transferred Former Employees were entitled under the Company Plans in
effect immediately prior to the Closing, subject to any variations agreed with
such Employees. These obligations are not intended to limit any provisions of
applicable Law or Contracts which are more favorable to Transferred Employees
or Transferred Former Employees.

  



  

(b) To the extent that service is relevant for purposes of
eligibility, vesting or benefit accrual under any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement established or maintained by the Purchaser for the
benefit of Transferred Employees or Transferred Former Employees, such plan,
program or arrangement will credit such employees or former employees for
service on or prior to the Closing with the Acquired Companies and their
Affiliates.

  



  

(c) Upon the Closing Date, the Purchaser will honor or cause the
Acquired Companies to honor in accordance with their terms all
individual employment, severance, retention and other compensation agreements
then existing between the Acquired Companies and any employee, director or
officer thereof, except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Purchaser and
such Person.

  



  

(d) Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Purchaser and the Seller will cooperate in good faith to prepare a
written communication to the Transferred Employees and written guidance for
any verbal communications by or on behalf of either party to the Transferred
Employees regarding the employee benefits (including equity compensation
arrangements) to be provided to the Transferred Employees by the Acquired
Companies following the Closing.

  



  

(e) The Purchaser shall cause the applicable Retention Payment to
paid to each individual identified on Schedule 1.1(c) to the Seller
Disclosure Schedules on the first regularly scheduled payroll date for such
individual following the Closing Date.

  



  

 _Section 10.2_ _Indemnity_. From and after the Closing and subject
to Sections 8.3 and 8.5(a)(iii), the Purchaser will indemnify and hold

Plan maintained or sponsored directly by any Acquired Company that transfers
with the Acquired Companies by operation of Law, (b) any claim with respect
to any Company Plan which transfers in whole, or in part, by operation of

 _Section 11.1_ _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) The parties agree to continue to abide by that certain
Confidentiality Agreement between ARIAD US and Purchaser dated January 19,
2016 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which will survive until the
Closing, at which time the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated
prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms.

  



  

(b) For a period of [***] years after the Closing, the Seller will,
and will instruct its Representatives to, hold in confidence,
unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or by
other requirements of Law, all non-public documents and information to the
extent relating to the Acquired Companies (the " _Company Information_ "),
except to the extent that such the Company Information (i) must be disclosed
in connection with the obligations of the Seller pursuant to this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, (ii) can be shown to have been in the public domain
through no fault of the Seller or (iii) was later lawfully acquired by the
Seller from sources other than those related to its prior ownership of the
Acquired Companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will this
Section 12.1(b) limit or otherwise restrict the right of the Seller to
disclose such the Company Information (w) to its and its Affiliates'
respective Representatives to the extent reasonably required to facilitate
the negotiation, execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, (x) to any Governmental Authority or arbitrator to the

impair any exculpatory or indemnification provisions now existing in the
Organizational Documents of any Acquired Company for the benefit of any
individual who served as a director or officer of any Acquired Company at any
time prior to the Closing (each an " _Affiliate Indemnified Party_ "), except
for any changes which may be required to conform with changes in applicable
Law and any changes which do not affect the application of such provisions to
acts or omissions of such individuals prior to the Closing. Without
limiting the generality of this Section 12.2, the provisions of this Section
12.2 are intended for the benefit of, and may be enforced by, each of the
Affiliate Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs.

  



  

 _Section 11.3_ _Seller 's Group Marks_.

  



  

(a) As soon as practicable after Closing, and in any event by no

following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, without the
prior written consent of the Board of Directors of ARIAD US, no Controlled
Person shall (or assist or encourage others to) directly or indirectly in any
manner: (i) acquire, announce an intention to acquire, or agree to acquire,
directly or indirectly, alone or in concert with others, by purchase, gift or
otherwise, any direct or indirect beneficial ownership (within the meaning of
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or interest in any securities or direct or
indirect rights, warrants or options to acquire, or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for, any securities of ARIAD US; (ii) make, or in any way
participate in, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert with others, any
"solicitation" of "proxies" to vote (as such terms are used in the proxy
rules of the SEC promulgated pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act) any
securities of ARIAD US with respect to any business combination,
restructuring, recapitalization or similar transaction; (iii) form, join or in
any way participate in a "group" within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of
the Exchange Act with respect to any voting securities of ARIAD US; (iv)
acquire, announce an intention to acquire, or agree to acquire, directly or
indirectly, alone or in concert with others, by purchase, exchange
or otherwise, (x) any of the assets, tangible or intangible, of ARIAD US or

or prohibited under clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 12.4(a);
(vi) otherwise act in concert with others, to seek to offer to ARIAD US or
any of its stockholders any business combination,
restructuring, recapitalization or similar transaction to or with ARIAD US,
or (vii) take any action to control or influence the management, Board of
Directors or policies of ARIAD US.

  



  

(b) The provisions of Section 12.4(a) shall not apply (i) in the
event that ARIAD US announces publicly that it is seeking purchasers
for ARIAD US, (ii) upon the commencement by a third party of a tender or
exchange offer for more than 50% of the voting power of the outstanding
voting securities of ARIAD US, provided that if such third party withdraws its
tender or exchange offer, Section 11.4(a) shall again apply as of the date of
such withdrawal, (iii) if a third party acquires beneficial ownership of more
than 20% of the outstanding common stock of ARIAD US, (iv) if ARIAD US
publicly announces a transaction, or an intention to effect any
transaction, which would result in (A) the sale by ARIAD US or one or more of

the case of a merger transaction, the surviving corporation (or, if the
surviving corporation is a subsidiary of a parent company, the
parent company) or (C) a third party acquiring beneficial ownership of more
than 20% of the outstanding common stock of ARIAD US. For clarity, the
foregoing provisions shall prohibit the Controlled Persons from acquiring
shares of common stock of ARIAD US pursuant to a public tender offer for all
outstanding common stock of ARIAD US in consideration for cash unless one of
the exceptions in the preceding sentence applies. Notwithstanding the above,
cumulative acquisitions by the Controlled Persons of less than [***] of ARIAD
US's outstanding common shares shall not be deemed a breach of this provision.

  



  

(c) Nothing in this Section 11.4 shall prevent a Controlled Person
from privately approaching ARIAD US to make an offer for the
acquisition solely by the Controlled Persons of ARIAD US or any assets of
ARIAD US, including ARIAD US's rights to Products; _provided_  that, (i) in
the event ARIAD US does not accept any such offer, no Controlled Person shall
take any action in contravention of Section 11.4(a), which shall continue to
apply in all respects in accordance with the provision thereof and (ii) no
Controlled Person shall make any public announcement regarding any such
private approach by a

Controlled Person or otherwise take any action that would reasonably require
ARIAD US to make a public announcement regarding such offer or any of
the types of matters set Section 11.4(a).

  



  

 _Section 11.5_ _Further Actions_. Subject to the other express
provisions of this Agreement, upon the request of any party to this Agreement,
the other parties will execute and deliver such other documents, instruments
and agreements as the requesting party may reasonably require for the purpose
of carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(b) For a period of six years after the Closing Date or such longer
time as may be required by Law (i) the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, intentionally dispose of or destroy any of the Books
and Records without first offering to turn over possession thereof to the
Seller by written notice to the Seller at least 60 days prior to the proposed
date of such disposition or destruction and (ii) upon reasonable advance
notice, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, give the
Seller and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours and without unreasonable interruption of the Purchaser's business, to,

reasonable times at the Purchaser's principal place of business or at any
location where any Books and Records are stored. The provisions of Section
11.6(b)(i) shall not prohibit or restrict, and shall not require the
Purchaser to provide any notice to the Seller in connection with, the
deletion of electronic mail messages or other information stored in an
electronic format in the ordinary course of business in a manner consistent
with the Purchaser's electronic records retention policies and applicable Law.
The Seller's access to the Books and Records after the Closing Date pursuant
to Section 11.6(b)(ii) shall be limited to access that is reasonably
required to permit the Seller to comply with its financial and Tax reporting
obligations, to defend against any Proceeding or claim by a Third Party in
which the Seller or its Affiliates are involved relating to or in connection
with the Acquired Companies, or otherwise to comply with any requirement of
applicable Law, in each case, subject to the Purchaser's reasonable policies
restricting access by Third Parties to the Purchaser's and its Affiliates'
(including, following the Closing, the Acquired Companies') information
technology systems or assets.

  



  

(c) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, each of the
Purchaser and the Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
make available upon reasonable advance notice and at reasonable times upon
written request any personnel whose assistance or participation is reasonably
required in anticipation of, or preparation for, existing or future
Proceedings or claims by a Third Party in which such party or any of its
Affiliates are involved relating to or in connection with the Acquired
Companies.

the time for performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other
party to this Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties of any other party to this Agreement contained in this
Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants or conditions for
the benefit of such party contained in this Agreement. (i) any such extension
or waiver by any party to this Agreement will be valid only if set forth in a
written document signed on behalf of the party or parties against whom the
extension or waiver is to be effective; (ii) no extension or waiver
will apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty, or noncompliance with any covenant or condition, as the case may
be, other than that which is specified in the written extension or waiver; and
(iii) no failure or delay by any party in exercising any right or remedy
under this Agreement or any of the documents delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, and no course of dealing between the parties, operates as a waiver
of such right or remedy, and no single or partial exercise of any such right
or remedy precludes any other or further exercise of such right or remedy or
the exercise of any other right or remedy. Except as provided in Section 8.8,
any enumeration of a party's rights and remedies in this Agreement is not
intended to be exclusive, and a party's rights and remedies are intended to

obligations under this Agreement, except that the Purchaser may at any time
delegate the performance of its obligations (other than the obligation to pay
the Purchase Price) to any Affiliate of the Purchaser so long as the
Purchaser remains fully responsible for the performance of the delegated
obligation. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be
construed to give any Person, other than the parties to this Agreement, any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement except such rights as may inure
to a successor or permitted assignee under this Section 12.5.

PARTY WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR NOT.

  



  

 _Section 12.12_ _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur and the parties would have no adequate remedy
at Law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
The parties accordingly agree that, prior to the termination of this Agreement

entitled at law or in equity, such party is entitled to injunctive relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other party and otherwise to
enforce specifically the provisions of this Agreement against the other
party. Each party (a) expressly waives any requirement that the other party
obtain any bond or provide any indemnity in connection with any action
seeking injunctive relief or specific enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement (b) agrees it will not oppose the granting of such remedy.

of New York, New York. Each of the parties knowingly, voluntarily and
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any
such action or proceeding and waives any objection it may now or hereafter
have to venue or to convenience of forum. Any party to this Agreement may
make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process
to the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in Section 12.1. Nothing in this Section 12.13, however,
affects the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law.

  



  

 _Section 12.14_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES
KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED

ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT IN NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION AND
DELIVERY, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  



  

 _Section 12.15_ _No Joint Venture_. Nothing in this Agreement
creates a joint venture or partnership between the parties. This Agreement
does not authorize any party (a) to bind or commit, or to act as an agent,
employee or legal representative of, another party, except as may be
specifically set forth in other provisions of this Agreement, or (b) to have
the power to control the activities and operations of another party. The
parties are independent contractors with respect to each other under this
Agreement. Each party agrees not to hold itself out as having any authority
or relationship contrary to this Section 12.15.

Representative, incorporator, member, partner, equity holder or Affiliate of
the Seller, any Acquired Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall
have any liability for any Liabilities of the Seller, as applicable, under

transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

 _Section 12.17_ _Guaranty_.

  



  

(a) ARIAD US irrevocably guarantees all representation, warranty,
covenant and obligations of the Seller and the performance of its
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement. This is a guarantee of
payment and performance, and not of collection, and ARIAD US acknowledges and
agrees that this guarantee is full and unconditional, and no release or
extinguishments of the Seller's Liabilities (other than in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement), whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding
or otherwise, will affect the continuing validity and enforceability of this
guarantee. ARIAD US hereby waives, for the benefit of the Purchaser any
right to require the Purchaser as a condition of payment or performance of
ARIAD US to proceed against the Seller.

bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, will affect the continuing validity and
enforceability of this guarantee. Incyte US hereby waives, for the benefit of
the Seller any right to require the Seller as a condition of payment or
performance of Incyte US to proceed against the Purchaser.
