or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub or the Company:

 

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be

value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the

Time that are owned by Parent or the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent or the Company (other than shares of Common Stock held in trust
accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties), if any, shall
be cancelled automatically and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares cancelled pursuant to _Sections 3.1(b)_ and
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $14.00 in
cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

(d) All of the shares of Common Stock converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such
shares of Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry shares ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect
to such Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Merger Consideration into which the
shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares have been converted pursuant to this _Section 3.1_, as well as any
dividends to which holders of Common Stock may become entitled in accordance
with _Section 3.3(c)_.

(e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the

or securities as a result of a reorganization, combination, subdivision,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split or other similar change in capitalization, appropriate and
equitable adjustments shall be made to the Merger Consideration and any other
similar dependent items, as the case may be, to provide the holders of Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event or transaction. 

 



13 Section 3.2 _Paying Agent and Deposit of Payment Fund_.

 

(a) Not less than three Business Days before the Effective Time, Parent shall
(i) select a bank or trust company, satisfactory to the Company in its
reasonable discretion, to act as the paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent,
the terms and conditions of which are reasonably satisfactory to the Company.
Parent shall be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

(b) Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, on a timely basis after
the Effective Time, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and Company Options, for payment in
accordance with this  _Article III_ through the Paying Agent, sufficient
funds for the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and other amounts
payable under this _Article III_. Such funds provided to the Paying Agent are
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_."

Section 3.3 _Payment Procedures_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the fifth Business Day following the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share immediately prior to the Effective Time a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to
the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share less any required
withholding of Taxes pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(b) The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ __, _however_ , that any such
investments shall be (i) securities issued or directly and fully guaranteed or
insured by the United States government or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and having maturities of not more than one month from the date of
investment, (ii) money market mutual or similar funds having assets in excess
of $1,000,000,000 or (iii) rated Baa3 or P-3 (or higher) by Moodys Investors
Service, BBB- or A-3 (or higher) by Standard and Poors or BBB- or F3 (or
higher) by Fitch Group. Earnings on the Payment Fund shall be the sole and
exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall be paid
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. No investment of
the Payment Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent from making the payments required by this _Article III_, and following
any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common
Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which additional
funds will be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund.

 



14 (c) Until surrendered in accordance with this _Section 3.3_, each Certificate
and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time,
to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration,
subject to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or
other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may
have been authorized by the Company in accordance with this Agreement and that
remain unpaid at the Effective Time. Any Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share and, in the case of a Certificate, the shares of Common Stock
formerly represented by it.

 

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article III_ ,
except as otherwise provided by Law.

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the
Company one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ with respect to such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim
for Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party
hereto nor any of their respective Representatives shall be liable to any
Person in respect of cash that would have otherwise been payable in respect of
any Certificate of Book-Entry Share from the Payment Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been
surrendered before five years after the Effective Time (or, if earlier,
immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect
thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



15 (g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent ) by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by
the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such Person is
entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this _Article III_.

(h) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts that are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code, or any applicable state, local
or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted and
withheld and paid to the appropriate taxing authorities, those amounts shall
be treated as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
deduction or withholding was made for all purposes under this Agreement.

Section 3.4 _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised
his appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as set forth herein, unless and until the holder shall
have failed to perfect, or shall have waived, effectively withdrawn or lost,
his right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL and to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the DGCL. If any such
holder of shares of Common Stock shall have failed to perfect or shall have
waived, effectively withdrawn or lost such right or it is determined that such
holder does not have appraisal rights, each share of Common Stock of such
holder shall be treated as a share of Common Stock that had been converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any written demands received by
the Company for appraisal of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL or written threats thereof, attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company with respect to stockholders rights of appraisal and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the
foregoing.

 



16 Section 3.5 _Company Options and Company Stock Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Options_. As of the Effective Time, each Company Option
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, whether or not then
exercisable or vested, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company Option, shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive from Parent or the
Surviving Corporation promptly following the Effective Time an amount in
cash, if any, without interest, equal to the Option Consideration (as defined
below) multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may
be acquired upon exercise of such Company Option, immediately before the
Effective Time. " _Option Consideration_ " means the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of the applicable
Company Option.

 

(b) _Company Stock Awards_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, any then
outstanding restricted shares of Common Stock held under the Company Equity
Plan shall become fully vested, subject to applicable income and employment
withholding Taxes. All shares of Common Stock then outstanding as a result of
the full vesting of the restricted shares of Common Stock shall be cancelled
at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 3.5_, including obtaining
executed acknowledgements in the form of  _Exhibit D_ from each holder of
Company Options to the treatment of their Company Options as provided in
_Section 3.5(a)_.

and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease and operate its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to have such power and authority or to possess

business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so duly qualified, licensed and in good

under the Company Equity Plan, and (ii) Company Options to acquire 301,540
shares of Common Stock were issued and outstanding. All the outstanding shares
of the Companys capital stock and all shares of Common Stock that are

any similar rights under any provision of Law (including the DGCL), the
Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the certification of
incorporation or by-laws (or comparable documents) of any of its Subsidiaries

common stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary may vote (" _Voting
Company Debt_ "). Except as set forth in _Section 4.2(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, there are no (i) options, warrants, calls, subscriptions
or other rights, convertible securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock

in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Voting Company Debt or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such shares, equity interests or Voting
Company Debt, (ii) contractual obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) voting trusts or similar

capital stock of the Company.

 



18 (b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or equivalent equity
interests of each of the Companys Subsidiaries are owned of record and
beneficially, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all
Liens. No legend or other reference to any purported Lien appears upon any
certificate representing the shares or any equity securities or other

business hours and upon reasonable notice throughout the period prior to the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, to the
Company and its Subsidiaries personnel, properties, books and records
and, during such period, shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to such Representatives all information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries business as may reasonably be requested,
including with respect to any efforts of Parent to enter into third-party
administrative services, reinsurance arrangements or hedging arrangements with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries concurrently with or after Closing;
_provided_ __, _however_ , that nothing herein shall require the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any information to Parent or its
Representatives if such disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, as applicable, (i) cause significant competitive harm to it or its
Subsidiaries if the Transactions are not consummated, (ii) violate applicable
Law or the provisions of any agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or (iii) jeopardize any attorney-client or other privilege. The
Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate, signed by the President, Chief
Financial Officer/Treasurer and Secretary of the Insurance Company, attesting
to such information with respect to pre-Closing periods and as of the Closing
Date as Parent may reasonably request to permit the appropriate officers of
Parent and its Subsidiaries to complete and execute the Annual Statement of
the Insurance Company for the year ending December 31, 2012 (and, if the
Closing Date is after December 31, 2012, for the year ending December 31,
2013) to be filed with the NYSDFS, including the "Interrogatories" section
thereof. Parent agrees that it will not, and will cause its Representatives
not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ for any
competitive or other purpose unrelated to the consummation of the

amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between the
Company and Parent shall apply with respect to information furnished by the
Company, its Subsidiaries and the Companys officers, employees and other
Representatives hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not be prohibited from
using any Evaluation Material of the Company or its affiliates, or disclosing
any such Evaluation Material to potential third party administrators,
reinsurers or financing counterparties for the purposes of engaging or
entering into certain administrative services, reinsurance arrangements or
financing arrangements in connection with the Transactions. Any such
third party will be considered a "Representative" (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) of Parent, subject to such third party executing an
access letter pursuant to which such third party acknowledges being treated as
such.

 



48 (b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.2(a)_, the Company shall
(and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) provide to Parent and its
Representatives all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Reinsurance
Transaction, including (i) facilitating the negotiation and entrance into the
Coinsurance Agreement or any other agreements related thereto (as of a time at
or immediately prior to the Closing); (ii) taking all corporate actions
reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of the Reinsurance
Transaction; (iii) taking all action reasonably necessary to obtain any
approvals or authorizations of, and making any filings and registrations with,
and notifications to, all Governmental Entities required in connection with
the Coinsurance Agreement and the Reinsurance Transaction and (iv) taking all
other actions, including the extension of any agreement or other document,
reasonably requested by Parent to effect the foregoing. 

(c) The Company shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, deliver
to Parent, on a weekly basis, a summary report of (i) all transaction
activity and other significant events with respect to the Investment Assets
and (ii) the cash management strategy and activities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. From and after the date hereof until the Closing, the Company
shall cause the applicable executives or managers having primary
responsibility for the matters set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii)
to consult with Representatives of Parent as reasonably requested by Parent,
not to exceed once per week, with respect to such matters, including future
planned or potential purchases and sales of Investment Assets and the
treatment of any impaired or potentially impaired Investment Assets. In
addition, Parent shall be entitled to designate an observer to participate in
all meetings of the Companys investment committee. In such meetings with
management and such investment committee meetings, Parent or its
Representative may make recommendations to the Company with respect to such
matters, including recommendations related to the sale of Investment Assets
that are statutorily impaired or that Parent believes may become statutorily
impaired; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to
follow any such recommendations.

 



49 Section 6.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, and will
cause the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective officers, directors,
employees and other Representatives not to, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage
or knowingly facilitate, directly or indirectly, any inquiries with respect
to, or the making of, any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) except as permitted
below, (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with, or furnish access to
its properties, books and records or provide any information or data to, or
otherwise cooperate with, knowingly assist, or participate in, facilitate or
encourage any effort by, any Person (or any Representative of a Person)
relating to any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (B) approve, endorse or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or
(C) execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in connection
with the actions contemplated by _Section 6.3(b)_). The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Representatives to, immediately cease all
solicitations, discussions, negotiations and access to non-public information
with, to or by any Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub) with respect to
any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, including _Section 6.3(b)_, the Company shall not, and shall cause
its Representatives not to, at any time after the execution hereof, continue
or resume any such solicitations, discussions, negotiations or access to
nonpublic information with, by or to any Person (other than Parent and Merger
Sub) with which the Company entered into a confidentiality, standstill or
similar agreement before the execution and delivery hereof or had discussions
or negotiations before the execution and delivery hereof regarding any
proposal that constituted, or could reasonably have been expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal (any such Persons and their Affiliates and
Representatives being referred to as " _Prior Company Bidders_ "). The Company
shall promptly request that each Prior Company Bidder in possession of
nonpublic information that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with its consideration of any potential
Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all such nonpublic information
heretofore furnished to such Prior Company Bidder and immediately terminate
all physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such
Prior Company Bidder. Neither the Company nor the board of directors of the
Company (or any committee thereof) shall waive the benefits of, provide any
consent under, permit any noncompliance with, fail to enforce, or agree to
modify in any manner, any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

 



50 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in the event that the
Company receives an Acquisition Proposal, the Company and its board of
directors may participate in discussions or negotiations (including, as a part
thereof, making any counterproposal or soliciting a revised Acquisition
Proposal) with, or furnish any information (pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement not less restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality
Agreement and which contains a "standstill" or similar provision on terms not
materially more favorable to such third party than the terms of any
"standstill" or similar agreement, or provision in any agreement, applicable
to Parent with respect to the Company, _provided_ that under no circumstances
shall such standstill provisions expire earlier than the Outside Date) to, any
Person (other than a Prior Company Bidder) making such Acquisition Proposal
and its Representatives or potential sources of financing if the Companys
board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal
is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal that was
not solicited by the Company and that did not otherwise result from a breach
or a deemed breach of this _Section 6.3_, and subject to compliance with
_Section 6.3(c)_. The Company shall provide to Parent copies of all
nonpublic information (to the extent that such nonpublic information has not
been previously provided or made available to Parent) that is made available
to any such third party before it is provided or made available to such third
party. In addition, nothing herein shall restrict the Company from making any
disclosure to the Companys shareholders if the board of directors of the
Company determines, based on the advice of outside legal counsel, that failure
make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to give rise to a violation
of Law, in each case so long as such disclosure is limited to (x) a "stop,
look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (y) an express rejection of an
applicable Acquisition Proposal or (z) an express reaffirmation of the Company
Recommendation.

(c) The Company will promptly (and in any event within one Business Day)
notify Parent orally and in writing of the receipt by the Company of any
proposal (or inquiry with respect thereto) that constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall
include a copy of any written proposal, or a written summary of the material
terms of any unwritten proposal or inquiry and the identity of the Person(s)
making such proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep Parent fully
informed on a current basis of the status of any such proposal or inquiry,
including any change to the material terms thereof and (ii) provide to
Parent promptly and in any event within one (1) Business Day after receipt or
delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material sent
or provided to the Company from any third party in connection with any
proposal or inquiry or sent or provided by the Company to any third party in
connection with any proposal or inquiry. The Company shall not be required to
comply with this _Section 6.3(c)_ with respect to any proposal or inquiry to
the extent that the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith, based on the advice of outside legal counsel, that such compliance
would in such instance be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company shall promptly notify Parent of the fact of
such determination.

 



51 (d) If the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied with all their
obligations under this  _Section 6.3_, the board of directors of the Company
may, in response to a Superior Proposal, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval (and in no event after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval), (i) approve, endorse or recommend a Superior Proposal
and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) in order to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal or (ii) modify
or amend in a manner adverse to Parent or withdraw the Company Recommendation
((i) or (ii) above being referred to as a " _Change in Recommendation_ "),
_provided_ that prior to such Change in Recommendation, the board of directors
of the Company determines, in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel), that such action is necessary in order for the directors to
comply with their fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The board of
directors of the Company shall not make a Change in Recommendation pursuant
to this _Section 6.3(d)_ unless: (1) the Company notifies Parent in writing
of its intention to take such action, promptly after the board of directors of
the Company resolves to take such action but in any event not less than four
Business Days before taking such action, which notice shall include the
identity of the offeror and a true and complete copy of the most current
version of such Superior Proposal (including any proposed agreement or other
offer documents), (2) for four Business Days following delivery of such
notice, the Company negotiates in good faith with Parent with respect to any
revised proposal from Parent in respect of the terms of the Transactions (to
the extent Parent desires to negotiate) and (3) after such four-Business Day
period, the board of directors of the Company determines that such proposal
remains a Superior Proposal (it being understood that any amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms of any such Superior Proposal shall
require a new written notice from the Company and an additional four-Business-
Day period that satisfies this _Section 6.3(d)_)

 

Section 6.4 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries,
for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, to maintain for each employee and officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries employed by or providing services to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing Employee_
") salary, wages and other cash compensation opportunities (including cash
bonus and commission opportunities and other incentive awards) and employee
benefits (excluding equity or equity-based programs) that in the aggregate
are, taken as a whole, substantially comparable to the salary, wages and
other cash compensation opportunities (including cash bonus and commission
opportunities and other cash incentive awards) and employee benefits
(excluding equity or equity-based programs) provided to the Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this _Section
6.4(a)_ shall limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at
any time for any reason in a manner consistent with any applicable
contractual obligations and any applicable Company Benefit Plans.

 



52 (b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give each Continuing Employee full credit for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and level of benefits under
any Company Benefit Plans and each other employee benefit plan, policy or
arrangement, in each case, maintained for the benefit of Continuing Employees
as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the
Surviving Corporation (each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") for such Continuing
Employees service prior to the Effective Time with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities, to the same extent such service
is recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than for purposes of benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan). With respect to each Parent Plan that is a
"welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent or its
Subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition
or eligibility limitations or exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
with respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the
same extent that such limitations, exclusions or requirements were waived or
were satisfied under the applicable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) give effect, for the year in which the Closing
occurs, for purposes of satisfying any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed
to, Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under similar plans
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries in which such Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Merger shall
constitute a "change of control" within the meaning of each Company Benefit
Plan (or any similar term).

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.6_ of this Agreement, the
provisions of this _Section 6.4_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to
this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance
of doubt any Continuing Employees), other than the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other
rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section
6.4_) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

(d) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) establish, modify or amend any
Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan of the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries for any purpose or (ii) prevent
the amendment or termination of any such plans at any time. This shall not
prevent the parties entitled to enforce this Agreement from enforcing any
provision in this Agreement, but no other party shall be entitled to enforce
any provision in this Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment to such
Company Benefit Plan. If a party not entitled to enforce this Agreement
brings a lawsuit or other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as
an amendment to such Company Benefit Plan and that provision is construed to
be such an amendment despite not being explicitly designated as one in
this Agreement, that provision shall lapse retroactively as of its inception,
thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect.

 



53 Section 6.5 _Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation_. Parent will take all
actions necessary to (a) cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to
perform promptly their respective obligations under this Agreement, (b) cause
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and (c) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall not conduct any business, make any investments or incur or
guarantee any indebtedness.

Section 6.6 _Publicity_. The initial joint press release by Parent and the
Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. Neither the Company nor
Parent (nor any of their respective controlled Affiliates) shall issue any
other press release or make any other public announcement with respect to this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions without the prior
agreement of the other party, which agreement shall not be unreasonably
delayed, withheld or conditioned, except as may be required by Law or by any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case the
party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement
shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other
party before making any such public announcements; _provided_ that the Company
will not be required to obtain the prior agreement of or consult with Parent
in connection with any such press release or public announcement with respect
to any actions contemplated by _Section 6.3(d)_ if the Companys board of
directors has effected a Change in Recommendation (including in connection
with any press release or public announcement relating to such Change in
Recommendation).

Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification._

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who at any time prior to the
Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company or any of its
present or former Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities in connection with actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
Transactions) to the fullest extent a Delaware corporation is permitted by Law
to indemnify its directors and officers, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
promptly advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent a Delaware
corporation is permitted by Law to advance expenses to its directors and
officers. The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification and
advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted by Law, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified
Parties.

 



54 (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect for not less than six years from
the Effective Time the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (including the policies listed
on  _Section 6.7_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) maintained by the
Company and the Companys Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties and any
other employees, agents or other individuals otherwise covered by such
insurance policies prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Insured
Parties_ ") with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including the Transactions); _provided_ that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of substantially the same
coverage containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the
Insured Parties and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall Parent and
the Surviving Corporation be required to pay aggregate annual premiums for
insurance under this _Section 6.7(b)_ in excess of 250% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof for its existing
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance, which amount is set forth on _Section 6.7_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter (the " _Maximum Premium_ "), it being understood that if
such terms and conditions cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by
paying an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall only
be required to obtain as much similar insurance as may be obtained for such
Maximum Premium. At the Companys option, the Company may purchase prior to
the Effective Time a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (including the policies listed on _Section 6.7_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter) maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without
limitation the Transactions; provided, however, that the Company shall not
pay or agree to pay aggregate annual premiums for such policy in excess of the
Maximum Premium. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no
other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for
insurance hereunder.

(c) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.7_.

(d) This _Section 6.7_ is intended to benefit the Insured Parties and the
Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation. Parent hereby
guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving Corporation of the
indemnification and other obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ and the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



55 (e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors, assigns and transferees of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or their respective successors or assigns, as the case may be,
assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.7_.

Section 6.8 _Proxy Statement; Company Special Meeting_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall
prepare a draft of the Proxy Statement. Parent shall furnish all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement and any
updates to such information, as appropriate. The Company shall provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such draft, and once
such draft is in a form reasonably acceptable to each of Parent and the
Company, the Company shall file the Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) respond to any comments on the
Proxy Statement or requests for additional information from the SEC as soon as
practicable after receipt of any such comments or requests and (ii) cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement. The Company shall promptly
(A) notify Parent upon the receipt of any such comments or requests and (B)
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand, to the extent such correspondence relates to the Proxy Statement.
Before responding to any such comments or requests or the filing or mailing of
the Proxy Statement, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any drafts of the Proxy Statement and
related correspondence and filings, and shall include in such drafts and
related correspondence and filings all comments reasonably proposed by Parent
and reasonably acceptable to the Company.

 

(b) Following the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC, the Company
shall, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation
and by-laws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of
the Companys stockholders (including any adjournment or postponement thereof,
the " _Company Special Meeting_ ") as soon as practicable following the date
hereof, for the purpose of considering the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Special
Meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees
that its obligations under this _Section 6.8_ shall not be affected by (i)
the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any Change in Recommendation.

 



56 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may, from time to time, adjourn, postpone or recess the Company
Special Meeting, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the
Agreement or to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement
is provided to the stockholders of the Company sufficiently in advance of the
vote to be held at such meeting, _provided_ that the Company Special Meeting
may not be adjourned to a date later than the date that is thirty days after
the date for which the Company Special Meeting was originally scheduled in
the Proxy Statement mailed to the stockholders of the Company.

(d) Subject to applicable Law, each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
advise the other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental
Entity, the consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the
Transactions, that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any regulatory approval will not be obtained or that the
receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed or conditioned. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, each party shall consult with the other
party prior to responding to any communication from any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Transactions.

Section 6.9  _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall each use
their reasonable best efforts to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law or otherwise to ensure that the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ are satisfied and to consummate and make effective the
Transactions; (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any actions, non-

jurisdictions other than the United States, (C) any applicable Insurance Laws
(including approval of the requested Extraordinary Dividend, the
Coinsurance Agreement and the Reinsurance Transaction) and (D) other
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and Parent will
cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such filings,
including providing copies of all such filings and attachments to outside
counsel for the non-filing party prior to the time of filing; (iv) furnish all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to any applicable Law in connection with the Transactions; (v) keep the other

(vi) permit the other parties to review any material communication delivered
to, and consult with the other party in advance of any meeting or conference

with any proceeding by a private party relating thereto, and give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences (to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity or private
party); (vii) avoid the entry of, or have vacated or terminated, any decree,
order or judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including
defending any 

 



57  lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the consummation of
the Transactions; (viii) execute and deliver any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Transactions; (ix) obtain, and cooperate in
obtaining, any consents of third parties such that neither the consummation of
the Transactions, nor any contemplated post-Closing restructuring of the
holding company structure of the Insurance Company, conflicts with, results in
a violation or breach of, constitutes (with or without due notice or lapse of
time or both) a default (or gives rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration) under, or gives rise to a right of
termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation, or to loss of a
material benefit under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties shall not be required to pay
or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any
Person from whom any such consent may be required; and (x) cause each director
of the Insurance Company to deliver to the Insurance Company, with a copy to

Company, contingent on and effective as of the Effective Time. No parties to
this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary delay of the Closing at the
behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other parties to
this Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The terms of
this _Section 6.9_ shall not limit the rights of the Company set forth in
_Section 6.3_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, including this _Section 6.9_, Parent shall not be obligated to
take or refrain from taking or to agree to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries taking or refraining
from any action or to suffer to exist any condition, limitation, restriction

reasonably be likely to result in a Burdensome Condition. A " _Burdensome
Condition_ " shall mean (A) any condition which has the effect of subjecting
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to any Law, actuarial standard or accounting standard that is
materially different from the Laws, actuarial standards or accounting

applicable to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent such change

other companies of similar size to the Company and its Subsidiaries, operating
in the same lines of business within the insurance industry in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries operate; (C) any requirement to sell, divest,
operate in a specified manner, hold separate or discontinue or limit, before
or after the Closing Date, any assets, liabilities, businesses, operations,

relating to the contribution of capital, keep-well or capital maintenance
arrangements or maintaining risk based capital level or any restrictions on
dividends or distributions (other than restrictions on dividends or
distributions imposed by New York statute or published regulation) or (E)
any requirement or condition to remove or change any officer or director of
Parent, or any parent company or other Affiliate of Parent, it being
understood that none of the items set forth on _Schedule 6.9_ shall,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a "Burdensome Condition" if
imposed by the NYSDFS in connection with granting approval for change-of-
control of the Insurance Company.

 



58 Section 6.10 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "business
combination," "control share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover
statute or regulation shall become applicable to this Agreement or the
Transactions, each of the Company and Parent and the members of their
respective boards of directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are reasonably necessary so that this Agreement and the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated herein and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute or regulation on this Agreement and the Transactions.

Section 6.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (and
shall be permitted to) take such steps as may be necessary or advisable to
cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director
or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.12 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement, subject to applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify the other party of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of
any event that would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of
any party to effect the Merger and the other Transactions not to be satisfied,
(ii) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with
or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) any representation or
warranty made by it contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any
respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified
becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect; _provided_ , _however_
, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.12_ shall not
cure any breach of any representation or warranty, the failure to comply with
any covenant, the failure to meet any condition or otherwise limit or affect
the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

(a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be

than the Minimum Extraordinary Dividend Amount, or such greater amount as
Parent may reasonably determine, and (ii) declare and pay in full the approved
Extraordinary Dividend prior to or concurrently with Closing.

or arrangement or otherwise conduct any business or activities, except as

Extraordinary Dividend and, if the Insurance Company must dispose of assets to
pay such Extraordinary Dividend, which assets will be disposed; provided,
however, that nothing contained in this  _Section 6.13(c)_ shall be deemed
to permit Parent to control the actions of the Company or the Insurance
Company prior to the Effective Time. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the Extraordinary Dividend shall be comprised solely of cash, unless
otherwise required by the NYSDFS.

(d) The Company shall cause the Insurance Company to give J.P. Morgan
Investment Management Inc. notice of termination, effective no later than the
Closing, in accordance with Section 20 of the Investment Management Agreement.

Days, following a request from Parent, the Company shall provide any
applicable required notices under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act, or any similar state, local or foreign Laws, that Parent
requests, including notices to those employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries whose employment Parent indicates it may terminate on or
following the Closing Date, notices to applicable Governmental Entities and
any follow-up notices to notices already provided. The form of any such notice
shall be prepared jointly by the Company and Parent.

62 Section 7.3 _Conditions to the Obligations of the Company_. The obligations of
the Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction (or
waiver by the Company) of the following further conditions:

(a) each of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in
Article V shall be true and accurate (disregarding any qualifications as to
materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect contained therein) as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as if made at and as of such
time (other than those representations and warranties that address matters
only as of a particular date or only with respect to a specific period of
time which representations and warranties need only be true and accurate as of
such date or with respect to such period), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and accurate would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

(b) each of Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material
respects all of the respective obligations hereunder required to be performed
by Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, at or prior to the Closing; and

(c) the Company shall have received a certificate signed by an executive

conditions the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.3(a)_ and _Section
7.3(b)_ have been satisfied.

Section 7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section
7.1_, _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if
such failure was caused by such partys failure to act in good faith or use
its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions, as required by and subject to _Section 6.9_.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION

Section 8.1 _Termination_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger contemplated herein may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or, subject
to the terms hereof, after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained:

 

(a) by the mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent.

 



63 (b) by either the Company or Parent:

 

(i) if the Merger shall not have occurred on or prior to December 31, 2012
(the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be
available to any party whose failure to perform or comply in any material
respect with the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to
occur on or prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
condition set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ or  _Section 7.1(d)_ has not been
satisfied and all other conditions in _Article VII_ are satisfied on December
31, 2012, then the Company may elect, subject to _Section 8.1(e)_ and with
the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, to extend the Outside Date to January 31,
2013 (the " _First Extension Option_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
First Extension Option is properly exercised, and if the condition set forth
in _Section 7.1(c)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_ has not been satisfied and all other
conditions in _Article VII_ are satisfied on January 31, 2013, then the
Company may elect, subject to _Section 8.1(e)_ and with the prior written
consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned, to further extend the Outside Date to February 28, 2013 (the "
_Second Extension Option_ ");

(ii) if any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action, in each case, permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting any of the Transactions and such order, decree, ruling or other
action shall have become final and nonappealable;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_ shall have used its reasonable best efforts to contest, appeal and
remove such order, decree, ruling or other action in accordance with _Section
6.9_;

(iii) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at
the Company Special Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment,
postponement or recess thereof at which a quorum is present and a vote on the
approval and adoption of this Agreement was taken; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_ if such party has breached in any material respect any of its
obligations under this Agreement, in each case in a manner that caused the
failure to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Special
Meeting, or at any adjournment, postponement or recess thereof;

(iv) if any condition to the obligation of such party to consummate the
Merger set forth in _Sections 7.1_ or _7.2_ (in the case of Parent) or
_Sections 7.1_ or _7.3_ (in the case of the Company) becomes incapable of
satisfaction before the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or
the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_ if the failure of such condition results from
material breach by Parent or Merger Sub (in the case of termination by
Parent) or the Company (in the case of termination by the Company) of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein; or

 



64 (c) by the Company:

 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform, in any
material respect, any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform,
either individually or in the aggregate, (A) would give rise to the failure of
the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or  _Section 7.3(b)_ (assuming
that the date of such determination is the Closing Date) and (B) cannot be or
has not been cured, in all material respects, by Parent or Merger Sub within
twenty (20) days after the giving of written notice to Parent (or, if less
than twenty (20) days prior to the Outside Date, prior to the Outside Date);
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(c)(i)_ shall not be available to the Company if it is then in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or  _Section 7.2(b)_; or

(ii) prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, and subject to the
terms and conditions of _Section 6.3(d)_, in order to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall have complied with all provisions thereof,
including the notice provisions therein and shall have paid the Company Fee
concurrently with such termination.

(d) By Parent:

 

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform, in any material
respect, any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform, either
individually or in the aggregate, (A) would give rise to the failure of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ (assuming that
the date of such determination is the Closing Date) and (B) cannot be or has
not been cured, in all material respects, by the Company within twenty (20)
days after the giving of written notice to the Company (or, if less than
twenty (20) days prior to the Outside Date, prior to the Outside Date);
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(d)(i)_ shall not be available to Parent if it or Merger Sub is then
in material breach of any of their respective representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach would give
rise to the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or 
_Section 7.3(b)_;

(ii) if, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Companys
board of directors shall have effected a Change in Recommendation;

 



65 (iii) if the Companys board of directors fails to reaffirm publicly
and unconditionally its recommendation to the Companys stockholders that
they give the Company Stockholder Approval within two (2) Business Days of
Parents written request to do so (which request may be made at any time
following public disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal), which public
reaffirmation must also include the unconditional rejection of such
Acquisition Proposal; or

(iv) if the Company materially breaches _Section 6.3_ ( _No Solicitation_ ).

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 8.1(b)(i)_, the Companys right to exercise the
First Extension Option and Second Extension Option is subject to the Company
reimbursing, and if the First Extension Option or the Second Extension Option
is exercised the Company shall reimburse, Parent and Merger Sub, on demand,
for all incremental out-of-pocket expenses, including all fees and expenses of
counsel, financial advisers, accountants, consultants and other advisers,
actually incurred by Parent or Merger Sub after December 31, 2012 in
connection with obtaining the Parent Insurance Approvals or the Company
Insurance Approvals, and all incremental Net Hedging Costs actually incurred
by Parent or Merger Sub after December 31, 2012; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the hedging arrangements extended or put in place after December 31, 2012
shall be substantially similar in type and scope (other than with respect to
duration which shall not extend beyond February 28, 2013) as those in place
immediately prior to December 31, 2012; and _provided_ _further_ , that no
later than December 1, 2012, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company
with a complete schedule of all hedging arrangements entered into by Parent or
its Affiliates in connection with the Transactions. Anything contained in this
_Section 8.1(e)_ to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that any
Parent Insurance Approvals or Company Insurance Approvals have not been
obtained on or prior to December 31, 2012 as a result of delay in approval of
the Recapitalization by the Delaware Department of Insurance, then the
Company may extend the Outside Date as permitted by _Section 8.1(b)(i)_
without any obligation to reimburse any incremental expenses or Net Hedging
Costs under this _Section 8.1(e)_.

 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by a party pursuant to _Section 8.1_,
written notice thereof shall be given to the other party or parties specifying
the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this
Agreement shall terminate, become void and have no effect, and the
Transactions shall be abandoned without further action by the parties;
_provided_ , that _Article I_ , _Section 4.23_,  _Section 5.9_, this
_Section 8.2_, _Section 9.3_, _Section 9.4_, _Section 9.6_, _Section
9.8_, _Section 9.9_, _Section 9.10_, _Section 9.14_ and  _Section 9.15_
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and _provided_ , _further_ ,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any such termination in accordance
with its terms. Nothing contained in this  _Section 8.2_ shall relieve
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company from liability for any willful or
intentional material breach of this Agreement or for any breach giving rise to
a termination under _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ or  _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, or as
provided for in the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



66 (b) If this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_;

 

(ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, _(iii)_ or _(iv)_ ;

 

(iii) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ and (A)
an Acquisition Proposal had been publicly disclosed after the date of this
Agreement and prior to such termination, and (B) within 12 months after such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to,
or consummates, the transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal; or

(iv) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_;

 

then the Company shall pay to Parent a nonrefundable termination fee of $18
million in cash (the " _Company Fee_ ") concurrently with any termination
referred to in _Sections 8.2(b)(i)_ , _(ii)_ or _(iv)_ , and concurrently
with the first to occur of the events referred to in _Section
8.2(b)(iii)(B)_, as applicable; _provided_ _that_ , solely for the purposes
of this _Section 8.2(b)_, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning ascribed thereto in _Section 1.1_, except that all references in such
definition to "20% or more" shall be changed to "a majority".

(c) The Company shall reimburse Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

(i) if this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than those specified
in _Section 8.2(c)(ii)_ or pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_, the Company
shall reimburse Parent and Merger Sub for all their out-of-pocket expenses,
including all fees and expenses of counsel, financial advisers, accountants,
consultants and other advisers, actually incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the Merger and the other Transactions,
but excluding any costs related to any hedging arrangements entered into by
Parent or its Affiliates in connection with the Transactions (" _Hedging
Costs_ "), not reimbursed under _Section 8.1(e)_ up to a maximum of $3
million; and

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to (x) _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or _(iv)_ and, at the time of such termination,
one or more of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_, _(c)_ , or
_(d)_ or _Section 7.2(f)_ or _(g)_ are not satisfied, or (y) _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_, the Company shall reimburse Parent and Merger Sub (A) for all
their out-of-pocket expenses, including all fees and expenses of counsel,
financial advisers, accountants, consultants and other advisers, actually
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the
Merger and the other Transactions, but excluding any Hedging Costs not
reimbursed under _Section 8.1(e)_, up to a maximum of $1 million plus (B) an
amount, not to exceed $12.5 million, equal to 50% of all Net Hedging Costs not
reimbursed under _Section 8.1(e)_.

 



67 (d) All payments contemplated by this _Section 8.2_ shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent and shall be reduced by any amounts required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under applicable Law in respect of Taxes (and consistent with the
process set forth in  _Section 3.3(h)_). The parties hereto agree that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Fee on more than one
occasion.

(e) Parent, the Company and Merger Sub acknowledge that (i) the fees and other
provisions of this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and
are not severable, (ii) without these agreements, Parent, the Company and
Merger Sub would not enter into the Agreement and (iii) any amount payable
pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ is not a penalty. Subject to _Section 9.12_
and  _Section 8.2(a)_, and except in the event of a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge
and agree that receipt of the Company Fee and other amounts payable pursuant
this  _Section 8.2_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and
Merger Sub against the Company in the event the Company Fee becomes due and
payable, and upon payment of the Company Fee and such other amounts, none of
the Company nor any of its officers, employees, stockholders,
Representatives, agents or advisors shall have any further monetary liability
or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions. In no event shall the Company be required to
pay the Company Fee on more than one occasion.

date of such rejection, refusal or inability to deliver. Nothing in this
section shall be deemed to constitute consent to the manner or address for
service of process in connection with any legal proceeding, including
litigation arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

 

Section 9.4 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement. Disclosure of any fact, circumstance or
information in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed for the purposes of any sections
of this Agreement to which such section relates and any other sections of
this Agreement to the extent it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure
also qualifies or applies to such other sections of this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that no disclosure shall qualify _Section 4.1_ (
_Organization_ ), _Section 4.2_ ( _Capitalization; Subsidiaries_ ), _Section
4.3_ ( _Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Company Action_ ) or  _Section
4.23_ ( _Brokers or Finders_ ) unless it is set forth in the specific
Schedule, or the section or subsection of the Schedule, corresponding to such
Section. The inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or
evidence of materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard of
materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

 

Section 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. Facsimile
signatures or signatures received as a pdf attachment to electronic mail
shall be treated as original signatures for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



70 Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure
Letter and the exhibits hereto, together with the other instruments referred
to herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and (b)
except as provided in _Section 6.7_, on and after the Effective Time, are not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder; except for (i) the rights of the Companys stockholders
and holders of the Company Options to receive the Merger Consideration and
related consideration, respectively, at the Effective Time and (ii) the
Indemnified Parties and the Insured Parties shall have the right to seek
specific performance and pursue monetary damages in the event of Parents or
the Surviving Corporations breach of  _Section 6.7_. The representations
and warranties set forth in _Articles IV_ and _V_ and the covenants and
agreements set forth in _Article VI_ have been made solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and (a) may be intended not as statements of
fact, but rather as a way of allocating risk to one of the parties if those
statements prove to be inaccurate; (b) have been qualified in certain
instances by references to the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter, which contain certain disclosures not reflected in the text
of this Agreement; and (c) may apply standards of materiality in a way that is
different from what may be viewed as material by the stockholders of, or
other investors in, the Company or Parent.

Section 9.7 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that Transactions are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware applicable to contracts to be made and performed entirely
therein without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof or
of any other jurisdiction.

Section 9.9 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) expressly
and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery, and any state appellate court therefrom within the State
of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or
federal court within the State of Delaware) (each, a " _Chosen Court_ ") in
the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
(b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions in any court other than a Chosen Court and (d) each of the
parties hereto agrees that each of the other parties shall have the right to
bring any action or proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by Chosen
Court in any other court or jurisdiction.

 



71 Section 9.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE
PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS.

Section 9.11 _Service of Process_. Each party irrevocably consents to the
service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred
to in _Section 9.9_ hereof in any such action or proceeding by mailing
copies thereof by registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return
receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section
9.3_ hereof. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to
effect service of process on the other party by any other legally available
method.

Section 9.12  _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
immediate, extensive and irreparable damage, for which monetary damages would
not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do
not perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions (and,
more specifically, that irreparable damage would likewise occur if the Merger
were not consummated and the Companys stockholders did not receive the
Merger Consideration payable to them in accordance with the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement), in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity, and accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof (including the obligation of the parties hereto to
consummate the Merger and the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to pay, and
the Companys stockholders right to receive, the Merger Consideration payable
to them pursuant to the Merger, in each case, in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement) in Chosen Courts without
proof of damages or otherwise, and that such explicit rights of specific
performance are an integral part of the Transactions and, without such
rights, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that the other parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

 



72 Section 9.13 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger
Sub of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and
assigns.

 

Section 9.14 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such
costs and expenses, whether or not the Merger or any of the Transactions is
consummated.

 

Section 9.15 _Headings_. Headings of the articles and sections of this
Agreement and the table of contents, schedules and exhibits are for
convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or
interpretative effect whatsoever.

 

Section 9.16 _Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party
expressly granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist
upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure.
