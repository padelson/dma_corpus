2.1 **_Conversion of Securities_**.

 



 

(a) _Crosstex and Rangers Merger Sub_. Immediately prior to the Crosstex
Effective Time, Devon shall contribute or cause to be contributed to New
Public Rangers $100,000,000 in cash to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration.
At the Crosstex Effective Time, by virtue of the Crosstex Merger and without
any action on the part of any party or the holders of any securities of
Crosstex or Rangers Merger Sub:

 



 

(i) _Generally_. Each share of Crosstex Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Crosstex Effective Time (other than any shares of
Crosstex Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ or
_Section 2.1(a)(iv)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into
the right to receive (A) an amount in cash equal to the quotient of (1)
$100,000,000 divided by (2) the number of shares of Crosstex Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Crosstex Effective Time (other
than any shares of Crosstex Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)(ii)_ or _Section 2.1(a)(iv)_ ) (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and (B)
one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable New Public Rangers Common
Unit (the " _Unit Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash Consideration,
the " _Crosstex Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Crosstex Common
Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Crosstex
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and each holder of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Crosstex Effective
Time represented any such shares of Crosstex Common Stock (" _Crosstex
Certificates_ ") or book-entry shares which immediately prior to the Crosstex
Effective Time represented shares of Crosstex Common Stock (" _Crosstex Book-
Entry Shares_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Crosstex Common Stock, except the right to receive the Crosstex
Merger Consideration and as provided by Law.

 



 

(ii) _Devon and New Acacia Owned Shares_. Each share of Crosstex Common Stock
owned by Devon or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist and no Crosstex Merger Consideration or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(iii) _Rangers Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock of Rangers
Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Crosstex Effective Time shall be converted into one share of
common stock of Crosstex Surviving Corporation, par value $0.01 per share,
which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of common stock of Crosstex
Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. Each share of Crosstex Common Stock
held in the Crosstex treasury and each share of Crosstex Common Stock, if any,
owned by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Crosstex immediately prior to the
Crosstex Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist without
any conversion thereof.

 



 

(b) _New Acacia and Boomer Merger Sub_. At the Devon Effective Time, by virtue
of the Devon Merger and without any action on the part of any party or the
holders of any securities of New Acacia or Boomer Merger Sub:

 



 

(i) _Generally_. The sole share of New Acacia Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Devon Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive 115,495,669 validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable New Public Rangers Class B Common Units (the " _Devon Merger
Consideration_ "). All such shares of New Acacia Common Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Devon Effective Time shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
and each holder of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
the Devon Effective Time represented any such shares of New Acacia Common
Stock (" _New Acacia Certificates_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of New Acacia Common Stock. Without any
action on the part of holders of New Acacia Common Stock, all outstanding New
Acacia Certificates shall, from and after the Devon Effective Time and upon
surrender of the certificate or certificates for New Acacia Common Stock for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, represent the right to receive the Devon
Merger Consideration with respect to each share of New Acacia Common Stock
represented thereby immediately prior to the Devon Effective Time. Promptly
following the Devon Effective Time, the parties shall cause the transfer agent
of New Public Rangers to issue and deliver to the sole stockholder of New
Acacia immediately prior to the Devon Effective Time, the Devon Merger
Consideration (in the form of book-entry interests, unless such stockholder
expressly requests that such interests be delivered in certificated form) in
respect of such New Acacia Common Stock.

 



 

(ii) _Boomer Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock of Boomer
Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Devon Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common
stock of Devon Surviving Corporation, par value $0.01 per share, which shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of common stock of Devon Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(iii) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. Each share of New Acacia Common Stock
held in the New Acacia treasury and each share of New Acacia Common Stock, if
any, owned by any Subsidiary of Devon immediately prior to the Devon Effective
Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist without any conversion
thereof.

 



 

2.2 **_Appraisal Rights_**. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, shares of Crosstex Common
Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Crosstex Effective Time
and that are held by holders of shares of Crosstex Common Stock who shall have
neither voted in favor of the Crosstex Merger nor consented thereto in writing
and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares of
Crosstex Common stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL

 



      
 

 



 

(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Crosstex Merger Consideration. Such
Crosstex stockholders shall be entitled instead to receive payment of the fair
value of such shares of Crosstex Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and at the Crosstex Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and the holders of such shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto except as set forth in this _Section 2.2_ , except that such
Dissenting Shares held by holders of shares of Crosstex Common Stock who shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their
rights to appraisal of such shares of Crosstex Common Stock under Section 262
of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Crosstex Effective Time, the right to
receive the Crosstex Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, in
accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_. Crosstex shall deliver prompt notice to
Devon of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Crosstex Common Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL that are received by Crosstex for appraisal of any shares
of Crosstex Common Stock, and provide Devon with the opportunity to
participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Crosstex Effective Time,
Crosstex shall not, without the prior written consent of Devon, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

2.3 **_Exchange of Crosstex Certificates_**.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Crosstex Effective Time, Devon shall cause
New Public Rangers to deposit with a commercial bank or trust company
designated by Devon and reasonably satisfactory to Crosstex (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Crosstex Common Stock,
book-entry interests (which, to the extent subsequently requested, shall be
exchanged for certificates) representing the total number of New Public
Rangers Common Units issuable as Unit Consideration and an amount of cash
sufficient to effect the delivery of the Cash Consideration pursuant to the
Crosstex Merger. Following the Crosstex Effective Time, New Public Rangers
agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed,
cash sufficient to pay any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
_Section 2.3(c)_ that may be payable following the Crosstex Effective Time
(such amounts, together with the Unit Consideration and the Cash
Consideration, the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Holders of Crosstex Certificates_. New Public Rangers shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to promptly (and in any event no more than five (5) Business
Days) after the Crosstex Effective Time, mail to each holder of record of a
Crosstex Certificate (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary
form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Crosstex Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Crosstex Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (B) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Crosstex Certificates in exchange for the
Crosstex Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Crosstex
Common Stock formerly represented by such Crosstex Certificates. Upon
surrender of a Crosstex Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed, and such other documents as may be

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the Exchange Agent shall
issue and deliver to the holder of such Crosstex Certificate (1) the number of
whole New Public Rangers Common Units (in the form of book-entry interests,
unless the holder of such Crosstex Certificate expressly requests that such
interests be delivered in certificated form) and (2) a check in an amount
equal to the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive, in each case, in respect of the shares of Crosstex Common
Stock formerly represented by such Crosstex Certificate, and the Crosstex
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Crosstex Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of Crosstex, the Crosstex Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Crosstex Common Stock may
be paid to a transferee if the Crosstex Certificate formerly representing such
shares of Crosstex Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_ , each Crosstex Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Crosstex Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Crosstex Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Crosstex Common Stock
formerly represented by such Crosstex Certificate and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ ,
in each case, without any interest thereon, except for Crosstex Certificates
in respect of Dissenting Shares, which shall represent the right to receive
the consideration due with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with _Section 2.2_ and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



 

(ii) _Holders of Crosstex Book-Entry Shares_. Promptly (and in any event no
more than two (2) Business Days) after the Crosstex Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall issue and deliver to each holder of Crosstex Book-Entry
Shares (x) the number of whole New Public Rangers Common Units (in the form of
book-entry interests, unless the holder of such shares of Crosstex Common
Stock expressly requests that such interests be delivered in certificated
form) and (y) a check in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of Cash
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive, in each case in
respect of such shares of Crosstex Common Stock, without such holder being
required to deliver a Crosstex Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Crosstex Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made in respect of New
Public Rangers Common Units with a record date after the Crosstex Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Crosstex Certificate,
unless and until the holder of such Crosstex Certificate shall surrender such
Crosstex Certificate. Subject to the effect of abandoned property, escheat or
other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Crosstex Certificate,
there shall be paid to the holder of whole New Public Rangers Common Units
issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Crosstex
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole New Public Rangers
Common Units, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Crosstex
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and

 



      
 

 



 

a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
New Public Rangers Common Units.

 



 

(d) _Further Rights in Crosstex Common Stock and New Acacia Common Stock_. The
Crosstex Merger Consideration issued and paid upon conversion of a share of
Crosstex Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such share of Crosstex Common Stock (other than the right to
receive dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with _Section
2.3(c)_ ). The Devon Merger Consideration issued upon conversion of a share of
New Acacia Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall
be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such share of New Acacia Common Stock.

 



 

(e) _Fractional Units_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
interests in New Public Rangers Common Units or book-entry credit of the same
will be issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Crosstex Common
Stock.

 



 

(f) _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by former stockholders of Crosstex entitled thereto one
hundred and eighty (180) days after the Crosstex Effective Time shall be
returned to New Public Rangers and such former stockholders shall thereafter
look only to New Public Rangers for payment of the Crosstex Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. Neither New Public Rangers nor the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any former holder of shares of Crosstex Common Stock for the
Crosstex Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other applicable Law.

 



 

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Crosstex Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Crosstex Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by New Public Rangers, the posting by such Person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as New Public Rangers may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Crosstex
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Crosstex Certificate the Crosstex Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Crosstex Common Stock formerly represented by such
Crosstex Certificate and any dividend or other distribution to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ , in each case without
any interest thereon.

 



 

(i) _Withholding_. New Public Rangers and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
local, state, federal, or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld by New Public Rangers or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be, and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such deducted or
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in

 



      
 

 



 

respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by New Public Rangers
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 



 

2.4 **_Stock Transfer Books_**. At the Crosstex Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Crosstex shall be closed with respect to shares of Crosstex
Common Stock and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Crosstex Common Stock theretofore outstanding on the
records of Crosstex. At the Devon Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
New Acacia shall be closed with respect to shares of New Acacia Common Stock
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares
of New Acacia Common Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of New
Acacia.

 



 

2.5 **_Crosstex Options and Other Equity Awards_**.

 



 

(a) Except with respect to "Covered Awards," as defined in and covered by any
Change of Control Waivers, all equity or equity based awards including, stock
options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units, and any other right to
receive Crosstex Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of such
shares, and each award consisting of shares of Crosstex Common Stock in each
case issued prior to the Execution Date pursuant to any plan or program of
Crosstex (collectively, the " _Crosstex Equity Plans_ ") that remain
outstanding (the " _Awards_ ") immediately prior to the Crosstex Effective
Time shall be fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Crosstex
Effective Time. For purposes of clarity, the defined term "Awards" shall not
include any Covered Awards.

 



 

(b) Awards that (i) are settled in cash pursuant to their terms and (ii) are
not stock options shall become fully vested immediately prior to the Crosstex
Effective Time and the amount of cash that is deliverable to the holder of the
Award in respect of settlement shall be calculated pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of the Award agreement and Crosstex Equity Plan
under which the Award was granted. The cash payment upon such settlement,
minus any applicable taxes required to be withheld that are payable in respect
of the lapse of vesting and settlement of the Award, shall be delivered to the
Award holder as soon as reasonably practicable on or after the Crosstex
Effective Time, but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the
Crosstex Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Awards that (i) consist of shares of Crosstex Common Stock or are settled
in stock pursuant to their terms and (ii) are not stock options shall be
settled immediately prior to the Crosstex Effective Time and the number of
shares of Crosstex Common Stock that are deliverable to the holder of the
Award in respect of such settlement shall be determined pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of the Award agreement and the Crosstex Equity Plan
under which the Award was granted. Such settlement shall be calculated net of
any applicable taxes required to be withheld that are payable in respect of
the lapse of vesting and the settlement of the Award. The shares of Crosstex
Common Stock issuable upon settlement of the Award shall be considered for all
purposes as outstanding immediately prior to the Crosstex Effective Time and
such shares will be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_.

 



 

(d) Awards that constitute stock options and that remain unexercised at the
Crosstex Effective Time shall remain in effect in accordance with their terms
and no amounts shall be

 



      
 

 



 

payable in respect thereto under _Section 2.1_ to the Award holder with
respect to the unexercised portion of such Award in connection with the
Crosstex Effective Time; provided, that such Awards shall be converted as of
the Crosstex Effective Time from awards in respect of Crosstex Common Stock to
awards in New Public Rangers Common Units pursuant to the terms of the
applicable Crosstex Equity Plan.

 



 

(e) Subject to the terms of the Change of Control Waivers, with respect to
each Covered Award and notwithstanding the terms of the applicable Crosstex
Equity Plans and award agreements, a change of control or change in control,
as applicable and as defined therein, will be deemed not to have occurred as a
result of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements with
respect to the Covered Awards in respect of Crosstex Common Stock, and as a
result (i) no portion of any Covered Award that would otherwise vest or become
payable or exercisable as a result of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements shall vest, or become payable or exercisable, and (ii)
the "Restricted Period", as defined in the applicable Crosstex Equity Plan and
award agreement, if any, with respect to the Covered Awards shall not
terminate, and the performance criteria, if any, with respect to the Covered
Awards shall not be deemed to have been achieved at any level as a result of
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. The Covered
Awards shall be converted from awards in respect of Crosstex Common Stock to
awards in New Public Rangers Common Units pursuant to the terms of the
applicable Crosstex Equity Plan.

 



 

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, Crosstex shall take, or shall cause its
Affiliates to take, all actions, including, as applicable, amending any of the
Crosstex Equity Plans or award agreements, necessary to permit and facilitate
the foregoing.

 



 

2.6 **_Reservation of Units; Registration_**. New Public Rangers shall take,
and shall cause its Affiliates to take, all corporate action necessary to
comply with all rules, regulations and guidance issued by the Agreed
Securities Exchange and the SEC, in addition to any other applicable Laws, as
they relate to the listing and registration of any New Public Rangers Common
Units granted, or to be granted to employees, consultants, or directors of New
Public Rangers or its Affiliates as new awards or converted awards in
connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement or the
Contribution Agreement.

principles of general applicability governing the availability of equitable
remedies, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and

(d), for such defaults or rights of termination, cancellation, amendment,
acceleration, violations or Liens as would not reasonably be expected to have

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (i)
result in any payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden
parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any officer, director, employee
or consultant of any Midstream Group Entity or Affiliate thereof; (ii)
materially increase any benefits otherwise payable by any Midstream Group
Entity or Affiliate thereof; or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time

dispute within the past two years and (ii) to the Knowledge of Devon, there
are no current union representation questions or petitions or organizing

4.18 **_Regulatory Matters_**. No Midstream Group Entity is (a) an "investment
company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or (b) a "holding company," a "subsidiary
company" of a "holding company," an "affiliate" of a "holding company," a
"public utility" or a "public-utility company," as each such term is defined
in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. All natural gas pipeline
systems and related facilities constituting the Midstream Business are
"gathering facilities" or "intrastate pipelines" that are exempt from
regulation by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, as amended. None of
the Midstream Group Entities is a "natural gas company" under the Natural Gas
Act of 1938, as amended. No Midstream Group Entity has utilized its facilities
to provide service as a common carrier subject to the jurisdiction of FERC
under the Interstate Commerce Act as such statute is implemented by FERC
pursuant to the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977. None of the
"intrastate pipelines" that are part of the Midstream Business provide
transportation services pursuant to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act
of 1978.

 



 

4.19 **_Insurance_**. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Midstream Group Material Adverse Effect and following the Devon Reorganization
Transactions, (a) each insurance policy under which any Midstream Group Entity
is an insured or otherwise the principal beneficiary of coverage related to
the Midstream Business (collectively, the " _Midstream Group Insurance
Policies_ ") is in full force and effect, all premiums due thereon have been
paid in full and such Midstream Group Entity is in compliance with the terms
and conditions of such Midstream Group Insurance Policy; (b) no Midstream
Group Entity is in breach or default under any Midstream Group Insurance
Policy; and (c) no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time,
would constitute such breach of default, or permit termination or
modification, under any Midstream Group Insurance Policy.

 



      
 

 



 

4.20 **_Ownership of Crosstex Common Stock_**. As of the Execution Date,
neither Devon nor any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns (within the
meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange Act) any of the outstanding shares of
Crosstex Common Stock. No Devon Party nor any of their respective "affiliates"
or "associates" (each as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) is an "interested
stockholder" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) of Crosstex.

 



 

4.21 **_Brokers  Fee_**. Except for the fee payable to Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner and Smith Incorporated which shall be paid by Devon, no broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any
brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of any Devon Party.

 



 

4.22 **_Information Supplied_**. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Devon Parties for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
(a) the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement
and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading and (b) the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to stockholders
and at the time of the Crosstex Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which such statement was made, not misleading.

 



 

4.23 **_Matters Relating to Acquisition of the Devon Merger Consideration_**.
Devon Gas Services has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of their
investment in the Devon Merger Consideration and is capable of bearing the
economic risk of such investment. Devon Gas Services is an "accredited
investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D (without regard
to Rule 501(a)(4)) promulgated under the Securities Act. Devon Gas Services is
acquiring the Devon Merger Consideration for investment for its own account
and not with a view toward or for sale in connection with any distribution
thereof, or with any present intention of distributing or selling the Devon
Merger Consideration in violation of applicable state and federal securities
laws. Devon Gas Services is not a party to any Contract or arrangement with
any Person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such Person or to any
third Person, with respect to the Devon Merger Consideration. Devon Gas
Services acknowledges and understands that (i) the acquisition of the Devon
Merger Consideration has not been registered under the Securities Act in
reliance on an exemption therefrom and (ii) the New Public Rangers Class B
Common Units comprising the Devon Merger Consideration will, upon their sale
by Devon Gas Services, unless such sale is registered under the Securities
Act, be characterized as "restricted securities" under state and federal
securities laws. Devon Gas Services agrees that the New Public Rangers Class
B Common Units comprising the Devon Merger Consideration may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of
except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act or pursuant to an available exemption from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act, and in compliance with other applicable state and
federal securities laws.

 



      
 

 



 

4.24 **_Investigation; No Other Representations or Warranties_**. Each Devon
Party has undertaken such investigation as it has deemed necessary to enable
it to make an informed and intelligent decision with respect to the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements to which it is a party. Devon Gas Services has had an opportunity
to ask questions and receive answers from Crosstex regarding the terms and
conditions of the offering of the Devon Merger Consideration and the business,
properties, prospects, and financial condition of New Public Rangers. The
foregoing investigation, however, does not modify the representations and
warranties of Crosstex in _Article III_. Each of the Devon Parties
acknowledges that such representations and warranties in this Agreement, the
Crosstex Disclosure Letter or in the certificate referenced in _Section
7.2(d)_ constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of
Crosstex to the Devon Parties in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this _Article IV_ , in the Devon
Disclosure Letter or in the certificate referenced in _Section 7.3(d)_ ,
neither the Devon Parties nor any other Person makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty, and Crosstex hereby disclaims reliance on
any other representation or warranty, on behalf of or relating to the Devon
Parties or any of their Affiliates, or their respective businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) or
prospects.

in preparing, and shall cause to be filed with the SEC as promptly as
practicable and, in any event, within twenty (20) Business Days of the
Execution Date, (i) a proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") in order to seek the Crosstex
Stockholder Approval and (ii) a registration statement on Form S-4 to register
the issuance of the New Public Rangers Common Units to be issued pursuant to
the Crosstex Merger (together with all amendments thereto, the " _Registration
Statement_ "), and in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus. Devon and Crosstex will cause the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder and other applicable Law. Each of Devon and
Crosstex will use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration
Statement become effective and the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as is practicable after filing and keep the Registration Statement
effective for so long as necessary to consummate the Crosstex Merger, and
Crosstex shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to the holders of Crosstex Common Stock as promptly as practicable
and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days after the Registration
Statement shall have become effective and the Proxy Statement shall have been
cleared by the SEC. Devon and Crosstex shall also take any action required to
be taken and make any necessary filings under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act or any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the Mergers,
this Agreement or the issuance of New Public Rangers Common Units and New
Public Rangers Class B Units in the Mergers. No amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement shall be filed without the
approval of Devon and Crosstex, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however,_ that, with respect
to documents filed by a party that are incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement or in the Proxy Statement, this right of approval shall
apply only with respect to information relating to the other party and its
Affiliates, their business, financial condition or results of operations or
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, further_ , that following a
determination by the Crosstex Board to make a Crosstex Recommendation Change
in accordance with _Section 6.4(f)_ , Crosstex may file an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement (and the related prospectus) or otherwise
publicly disclose such Crosstex Recommendation Change and disseminate such
information to the stockholders of Crosstex, in each case, without the consent
of Devon ( _provided, however_ , that Crosstex will provide Devon a reasonable
opportunity to review such amendment, supplement or public disclosure prior to
filing or dissemination) in order to (i) effect a Crosstex Recommendation
Change, (ii) describe the reasons for such Crosstex Recommendation Change and
(iii) disclose any additional information reasonably related to the Crosstex
Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _further_ that, in the case of clauses
(ii) and (iii), if making any such disclosure would constitute a breach of the
Confidentiality Agreement, Crosstex shall only be permitted to make such
disclosure to the extent the Crosstex Board determines, after consultation
with its outside legal advisor, that the

 



      
 

 



 

failure to make such disclosure would result in a violation of any applicable
federal securities Laws.

 



 

(b) Devon and Crosstex each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that
none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time
the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing
to stockholders and at the time of the Crosstex Stockholder Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not
misleading.

 



 

(c) If at any time prior to the Devon Effective Time, any party discovers any
information relating to Devon or Crosstex, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to either the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement so that
such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading,
the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
party and the parties will promptly file with the SEC an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminate such information to the stockholders of Crosstex.

 



 

(d) The parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any
correspondence, communications or comments from the SEC or the staff of the
SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or for
additional information and shall supply each other with (i) copies of all
correspondence and a description of all material oral discussions between it
or any of its respective Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the
staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statement or the Crosstex Merger and (ii) copies of all orders of
the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement.

 



 

6.2 **_Stockholders Meeting; Recommendations_**. Crosstex shall take, in
accordance with the DGCL and the Organizational Documents of Crosstex, all
actions reasonably necessary to call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Crosstex Stockholder Meeting_ ") as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective and the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for the purpose of
securing the Crosstex Stockholder Approval and, in any event (subject to the
last sentence of this _Section 6.2_ ), within thirty (30) days of the date the
Proxy Statement is mailed to the holders of Crosstex Common Stock, unless
otherwise agreed by the parties; _provided, however_ , that Crosstex shall
have no obligation to hold the Crosstex Stockholder Meeting prior to sixty
(60) days after the Execution Date. The Proxy Statement shall (i) state that
the Crosstex Board has (x) approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (y) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of Crosstex and its stockholders; (ii) include the recommendation of
the Crosstex Board that the holders of Crosstex Common Stock vote to adopt
this Agreement (such recommendation

 



   

     
 

 



 

described in clause (ii), the " _Crosstex Recommendation_ ") (except in the
case of subclause (i)(y) and clause (ii) to the extent that Crosstex effects a
Crosstex Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 6.4_); and (iii)
subject to the consent of the Crosstex Financial Advisors, include the written
opinions of the Crosstex Financial Advisors, that, as of the Execution Date
and based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations
set forth in such opinion, the Crosstex Merger Consideration to be received by
the holders (other than New Acacia and any direct or indirect subsidiary of
New Acacia) of Crosstex Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from
a financial point of view, to such holders. Unless Crosstex effects a Crosstex
Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 6._4, Crosstex shall use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit from stockholders of Crosstex votes in
favor of the Crosstex Stockholder Approval; _provided, however_ , that if the
Crosstex Board effects a Crosstex Recommendation Change in accordance with
_Section 6.4_, Crosstex may cease to use such efforts. The Crosstex Board
shall not effect a Crosstex Recommendation Change except pursuant to and
solely as permitted by _Section 6.4_. Notwithstanding any Crosstex
Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with the terms hereof, (x) this Agreement shall be submitted to the
stockholders of Crosstex at the Crosstex Stockholder Meeting and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Crosstex of such obligation and
(y) Crosstex shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition
Proposal other than the Mergers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Crosstex may adjourn or postpone the meeting of
Crosstex stockholders to the extent necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to Crosstex
stockholders to provide any disclosure required by applicable Law to be
provided to Crosstex stockholders, or, if as of the time for which the
meeting of Crosstex stockholders is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Crosstex Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to (A) constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct business at such meeting or (B) to approve the Crosstex
Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that, unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties, no adjournment may be to a date on or after three (3) Business Days
prior to the End Date.

 



 

6.3 **_Access to Information; Confidentiality_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.3(b)_ and applicable Law, Crosstex will provide and
will cause Crosstex Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, investment
bankers, advisors, and agents and other representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to provide Devon and its authorized Representatives,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, such
reasonable access to the offices, employees, customers, suppliers, properties,
books and records of Crosstex and its Subsidiaries (so long as such access
does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of Crosstex) as Devon may
reasonably request. Subject to applicable Law, Devon will provide and will
cause Devons Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to
provide Crosstex and its authorized Representatives, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable advance notice, such reasonable access to the
offices, employees, properties, books and records of the Midstream Group
Entities (so long as such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
operations of Devon or the Midstream Group Entities) as Crosstex may
reasonably request. No party shall have access to personnel records of the
other party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or
evaluation records, medical histories or other information that in such other
partys good faith opinion the disclosure of which could

 



      
 

 



 

subject such other party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability. No
party shall be permitted to conduct any sampling or analysis of any
environmental media (including any soils, sediments, groundwater, surface
water or atmosphere) or building materials at any facility of the other party
or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the other party,
which may be granted or withheld in such other partys sole discretion.

 



 

(b) With respect to any information disclosed pursuant to this _Section 6.3_,
each of Devon and Crosstex shall comply with, and shall cause each of its
Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations under the
confidentiality agreement, dated July 19, 2013, previously executed by Devon,
Crosstex and Crosstex MLP (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). No party
shall be required to provide access to or disclose any information where such
access or disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of such
party or any Subsidiary of such party or contravene any Contract or Law (it
being agreed that the parties shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not
result in such jeopardy or contravention).

 



 

6.4 **_No Solicitation_**.

 



 

(a)

 



 

(i) Crosstex shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors and officers, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their Representatives to, (A) immediately cease and terminate
any solicitation, knowing encouragement or knowing facilitation, discussions,
negotiations or other similar activities with any Persons other than Devon and
its Affiliates and its and their Representatives that may be ongoing with
respect to, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal; and (B) immediately revoke or withdraw access of any Person other
than Devon and its Affiliates and its and their Representatives to any data
room (virtual or actual) containing any non-public information with respect to
Crosstex or its Subsidiaries previously furnished in connection with any
activities described in clause (A).

 



 

(ii) Devon shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors and officers, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their Representatives to, (A) immediately cease and terminate
any solicitation, knowing encouragement or knowing facilitation, discussions,
negotiations or other similar activities with any Persons other than Crosstex
and its Affiliates and its and their Representatives that may be ongoing with
respect to, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, a Midstream
Acquisition Proposal; and (B) immediately revoke or withdraw access of any
Person other than Crosstex and its Affiliates and its and their
Representatives to any data room (virtual or actual) containing any non-public
information with respect to the Midstream Business previously furnished in
connection with any activities described in clause (A) with respect to the
Midstream Business; _provided, however_ , that in no event will Devon be
required to withdraw the Midstream Registration Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b)

 



 

(i) Crosstex shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective directors and officers not to, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries regarding, or the
making or submission of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (B) conduct or
engage in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose any information or
data relating to Crosstex or any of its Subsidiaries to, or afford access to
the business, properties, assets, books or records of Crosstex or any of its
Subsidiaries to, or knowingly take any other action to assist, facilitate or
cooperate with any effort by any third party with respect to, or that is
seeking to make or has made, any Acquisition Proposal, or (C) enter into any
agreement, including any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract relating to any Acquisition
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in circumstances
contemplated in _Section 6.4(c)_).

 



 

(ii) Devon shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective directors and officers not to, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries regarding, or the
making or submission of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Midstream Acquisition Proposal, (B)
conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose any
information or data relating to the Midstream Business to, or afford access to
the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Midstream Business
to, or knowingly take any other action to assist, facilitate or cooperate with
any effort by any third party with respect to, or that is seeking to make or
has made, any Midstream Acquisition Proposal, or (C) enter into any agreement,
including any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract relating to any Midstream
Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Crosstex and
its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives may take the actions
described in _Section 6.4(b)(i)(B)_ with respect to a third party prior to,
but not after, the receipt of the Crosstex Stockholder Approval, if (i)
Crosstex (A) has not materially breached this _Section 6.4_, and (B) receives
after the Execution Date a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal from such
third party that did not result from any breach of this _Section 6.4_ and
(ii) before taking any such actions, the Crosstex Board (or the Special
Committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that (A) failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of Crosstex directors
under applicable Law and (B) such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or would be reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal; _provided; however_ , that (1) Crosstex shall not deliver any
information or data to such third party or afford such third party any access
prior to entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such third
party and (2) Crosstex shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours), provide to Devon a copy of such

 



      
 

 



 

executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. Crosstex agrees that it shall
substantially concurrently with delivery to any third party provide to Devon
any information concerning Crosstex or its Subsidiaries that is provided to
any third party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal which information
was not previously provided to Devon.

 



 

(d)

 



 

(i) Crosstex shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours after receipt), advise Devon orally and in writing of
any Acquisition Proposal received by Crosstex, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of its or their Representatives from any Person, or any inquiry, discussions
or negotiations with respect to or that is related to any Acquisition Proposal
or by any party under circumstances reasonably expected to be related to the
evaluation or making of any Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and
conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, discussions or
negotiations, and Crosstex shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt), provide to Devon copies of any
written materials received in connection with any of the foregoing, and the
identity of the Person making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry or with whom any discussions or negotiations are taking place.
Crosstex shall keep Devon reasonably informed of any material developments
regarding the material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal on a
reasonably current basis (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours).
Crosstex agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any
confidentiality or other agreement with any Person subsequent to the Execution
Date that prohibits Crosstex from providing any information to Devon in
accordance with this _Section 6.4_.

 



 

(ii) Devon shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours after receipt), advise Crosstex orally and in writing of any
Midstream Acquisition Proposal received by Devon, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of its or their Representatives from any Person, or any inquiry, request
for information, discussions or negotiations with respect to or that is
related to any Midstream Acquisition Proposal or by any party under
circumstances reasonably expected to be related to the evaluation or making of
any Midstream Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of
such request, Midstream Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, discussions or
negotiations and Crosstex shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt), provide to Crosstex copies of
any written materials received in connection with any of the foregoing and the
identity of the Person making such a request, Midstream Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry or with whom any discussions or negotiations are taking place.
Devon shall keep Crosstex reasonably informed of any material developments,
discussions or negotiations regarding the material terms and conditions of any
Midstream Acquisition Proposal on a reasonably current basis (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours). Devon agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will
not enter into any confidentiality or other agreement with any Person
subsequent to the Execution Date that prohibits Devon from providing any
information to Crosstex in accordance with this _Section 6.4_.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Neither the Crosstex Board nor any committee thereof will (i) fail to
make, change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify the Crosstex Recommendation;
(ii) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange
offer for the shares of Crosstex Common Stock within ten (10) Business Days
after commencement of any such offer; (iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal; (iv) make
any public statement that is materially inconsistent with the Crosstex
Recommendation; or (v) publicly resolve or agree (whether or not publicly) to
take any of the actions described in subclauses (i) through (v) above (actions
described in subclauses (i) through (v) being referred to as a " _Crosstex
Recommendation Change_ ").

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to, but
not after, receipt of the Crosstex Stockholder Approval, the Crosstex Board
(or the Special Committee thereof) may (A) make a Crosstex Recommendation
Change in respect of an Acquisition Proposal or terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.1(g)_ in order to enter into a definitive written
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, in each case, if, prior to
taking such action, the Crosstex Board (or the Special Committee thereof) has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and the failure to make a Crosstex Recommendation Change or terminate
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(g)_ would be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the directors of Crosstex under applicable Law, or (B)
make a Crosstex Recommendation Change if, prior to taking such action, the
Crosstex Board (or the Special Committee thereof) has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that in response to an Intervening Event and in the absence of an
Acquisition Proposal, failure to make a Crosstex Recommendation Change in
response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the directors of Crosstex under applicable Law. The Crosstex Board
(or the Special Committee thereof) shall not make a Crosstex Recommendation
Change pursuant to _Section 6.4(f)(A)_ or terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.1(g)_ unless prior to taking such action (i)
Crosstex has given Devon at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice
of its intention to make a Crosstex Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(g)_ (which notice shall specify the
material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the
identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal)) and has
contemporaneously provided to Devon a copy of any proposed transaction
agreements related to such Superior Proposal, (ii) Crosstex has negotiated,
and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Devon
during such notice period to enable Devon to revise the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal, (iii) following the end of such notice period,
the Crosstex Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement proposed in writing by Devon, and shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that notwithstanding such proposed changes, the third-party proposal
remains a Superior Proposal and failure to make a Crosstex Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(g)_, as
applicable, in response to the Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the Crosstex directors under applicable Law, and (iv)
Crosstex has complied in all material respects with its obligations under this
_Section 6.4_. Any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms
of a Superior Proposal after delivery of a notice in respect of such Superior
Proposal shall require delivery of another notice and shall

 



      
 

 



 

commence a new notice period in respect of such Superior Proposal pursuant to
this _Section 6.4(f)_ except that, commencing with the third notice period
hereunder with respect to a Superior Proposal made by a particular Person, the
notice period shall be one (1) Business Day (rather than the three (3)
Business Days contemplated by clause (i) above). The Crosstex Board shall not
make a Crosstex Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 6.4(f)(B)_ unless
prior to taking such action, (w) Crosstex has given Devon at least three (3)
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to make a Crosstex
Recommendation Change (which notice shall provide a detailed description of
the Intervening Event), (x) Crosstex has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Devon during such notice
period to enable Devon to revise the terms of this Agreement in such a manner
or take other actions that would obviate the need for taking such action as a
result of such Intervening Event, (y) following the end of such notice period,
the Crosstex Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement or other actions proposed in writing by Devon, and shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that notwithstanding such proposed changes or other
actions, failure to make a Crosstex Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, and (z) Crosstex has complied in all material respects
with its obligations under this _Section 6.4_. No Crosstex Recommendation
Change shall change the approval of this Agreement for purposes of Section 251
of the DGCL, and no Crosstex Recommendation Change shall have the effect of
causing any state (including Delaware) corporate Takeover Law or other similar
statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Mergers).

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Crosstex Board or Devon from
complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law,
including (i) taking and disclosing to Crosstex stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen"
communication to the Crosstex stockholders or Devon stockholders, as
applicable, pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; _provided,
however_ , that in no event shall any such requirement affect, eliminate or
modify the obligations of Crosstex or Devon, as applicable, under, or the
effect of any such actions under, this _Section 6.4_; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any such disclosure made by the Crosstex Board will be deemed
to be a Crosstex Recommendation Change unless the Crosstex Board publicly
reaffirms the Crosstex Recommendation in such statement or in connection with
such action.

 



 

(h) Crosstex shall promptly inform its Representatives who have been engaged
or are otherwise providing assistance in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement of Crosstex obligations under this _Section
6.4_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Crosstex acknowledges
and agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section
6.4_ by any Representative of Crosstex or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to
be a breach of this _Section 6.4_ by Crosstex.

 



 

(i) _Definitions of Acquisition Proposal, Intervening Event; Midstream
Acquisition Proposal and Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of
interest relating to any transaction or series of related transactions (other
than the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement) from any third party involving: (a) a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving
Crosstex or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, taken together, constitute
fifteen percent (15%) or more of Crosstex consolidated assets, (b) any
purchase (including any lease, long term supply agreement, mortgage, pledge or
other arrangement having similar economic effect), directly or indirectly, in
any manner of any business or assets (including equity securities or other
interest in one or more Subsidiaries) that constitute fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the consolidated assets of Crosstex or that generate fifteen percent
(15%) or more of Crosstex consolidated revenues or net income, or (c) the
acquisition, directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or control of any
securities of Crosstex after which any person or group would own securities
representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the total voting power of any
class of Crosstex securities (or that are exchangeable for or convertible
into voting securities having such voting power).

 



 

" _Intervening Event_ " means a material Event that did not exist or was not
known to the Crosstex Board or the Special Committee thereof on the Execution
Date (or if known, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably
foreseeable by the Crosstex Board or the Special Committee thereof as of the
Execution Date), which Event, or any material consequences thereof, becomes
known to the Crosstex Board or the Special Committee thereof prior to receipt
of the Crosstex Stockholder Approval; _provided; however_ , that in no event
shall the receipt, existence, potential for or terms of an Acquisition
Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof constitute an
Intervening Event.

 



 

" _Midstream Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer, proposal, inquiry or
indication of interest relating to any transaction or series of related
transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) from
any third party involving: (a) a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation or similar transaction involving any Devon Midstream Entity whose
assets, taken together, constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
consolidated assets of the Devon Midstream Entities, (b) any purchase
(including any lease, long term supply agreement, mortgage, pledge or other
arrangement having similar economic effect), directly or indirectly, in any
manner of any business or assets (including equity securities or other
interest in one or more Subsidiaries) that constitute fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the consolidated assets of the Devon Midstream Entities or that
generate fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated revenues or net
income of the Devon Midstream Entities, or (c) the acquisition, directly or
indirectly, of beneficial ownership or control of any securities of any Devon
Midstream Entity after which any person or group would own securities
representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the total voting power of any
class of securities of any Devon Midstream Entity (or that are exchangeable
for or convertible into voting securities having such voting power). For
purpose of this definition, "Devon Midstream Entity" means any Person that is
or, upon consummation of the Devon Reorganization Transactions, will become, a
Midstream Group Entity; _provided, however,_ that a Midstream Acquisition
Proposal shall not include any offer, proposal, inquiry, or indication of
interest relating to any transaction described in clauses (a), (b) or (c)
above on terms which do not materially

 



      
 

 



 

interfere with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Contribution Agreement.

 



 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, on its
most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified (except that
references in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" to "15%" shall be
replaced with 50%) made by a third party, that the Crosstex Board (or the
Special Committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) (i) would be, if consummated,
more favorable to Crosstex stockholders from a financial point of view than
the Mergers (taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Devon in response to such offer or otherwise) and
relevant legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the
conditions for completion of such proposal; and (ii) is reasonably likely to
be consummated, taking into account the financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal.

 



 

6.5 **_Efforts to Consummate; Notification_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Devon and
Crosstex will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or

transactions contemplated by this Agreement including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) cause the conditions precedent set forth in _Article VII_ to
be satisfied, (ii) obtain all necessary waivers, consents, approvals, permits,
orders or authorizations (including the expiration or termination of any

permits, orders or authorizations from third parties, (iv) defend any
Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or

by any Governmental Entity that could prevent or delay the Mergers or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (v) execute and
deliver additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Crosstex agrees not to
extend any waiting period under HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Entity not to consummate the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, except with the prior written consent of Devon.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Devon and Crosstex
shall (i) make or cause to be made the registrations, declarations and filings
required of such party under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements

contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable and
advisable after the Execution Date and in no event later than fifteen (15)
Business Days after the Execution Date, (ii) furnish to the other party as

or such transactions, (iv) promptly notify the other party of any material
communication between that party and the FTC, the DOJ, or any other

authorizations (including the expiration or termination of any waiting
periods), or any agreement regarding the timing of consummation of the
Mergers), (v) subject to applicable Law, discuss with and permit the other
party (and its counsel) to review in advance, and consider in good faith the
other partys reasonable comments in connection with, any proposed filing or
communication to the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Governmental Entity or, in

the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or inquiry relating to any Regulatory Law or any investigation
or other Proceeding pursuant to any Regulatory Law in connection with this
Agreement or the Mergers unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, telephone
call or discussion, (vii) furnish the other party promptly with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications relating to any Regulatory Law or

their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the Mergers, and (viii) act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the
other party in connection with any such registrations, declarations and
filings and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of
any such agency or other Governmental Entity under the HSR Act or any other
Regulatory Law with respect to any such registration, declaration and filing
or any such transaction; _provided, however_ , that in the event of any
disagreement concerning any such filing, submission, investigation,
Proceeding, communication or meeting, the determination of Devon shall be
final and conclusive; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this Agreement
shall prevent a party from responding to or complying with a subpoena or other
legal process required by Law or submitting documents or factual information
in response therefor. Devon and Crosstex may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this _Section 6.5(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only
Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not

 



      
 

 



 

be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of
the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source
of the materials (Devon or Crosstex, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.5(b)_, materials
provided to the other party or its outside counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of Crosstex and its Subsidiaries or New
Acacia and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Devon shall have the right, but not the obligation, to agree to or take
any action that would result in making or offering proposals, remedies,
commitments or undertakings, executing or carrying out agreements (including
consent decrees) or submitting to Laws (i) providing for the license, sale,
divestiture or other disposition or holding separate (through the
establishment of trust or otherwise) of any business, assets, categories of
assets, or products of Devon, Crosstex or their respective Subsidiaries or the
holding separate of the capital stock or other Equity Interests of a
Subsidiary of Crosstex or Devon, (ii) otherwise imposing or seeking to impose
any limitation on Devon, Crosstex or any of their respective Subsidiaries
freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain, any of the
businesses, assets, categories of assets, or products of Devon, Crosstex, New
Public Rangers or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (iii) entering into,
modifying or terminating any relationship, contract or arrangement between
Devon, Crosstex, New Public Rangers or any of their respective Subsidiaries on
the one hand and any third party on the other hand (any matter referenced in
the foregoing clauses (i)(iii) being a " _Regulatory Divestiture_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ that (A) the consummation of any such Regulatory
Divestiture shall be contingent on the consummation of the Mergers, (B) Devon
may not agree to or effect any Regulatory Divestiture that would be material
to the Midstream Business and Crosstex, taken as a whole, without the prior
written consent of Crosstex and (C) the net proceeds of any such Regulatory
Divestiture with respect to the business, assets, categories of assets or
products of the Midstream Business shall be contributed to the applicable
Midstream Group Entity immediately prior to the Devon Effective Time.

 



 

6.6 **_Certain Notices_**. From and after the Execution Date until the earlier
to occur of (a) the Closing Date and (b) the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_, each of Devon and Crosstex shall promptly notify
the other of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any Event that would be
likely to cause any condition to the obligations of either party to effect the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied, or (ii) the failure of Devon or Crosstex to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any
condition to the obligations of either party to effect the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 6.6_ shall not cure the inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty, the failure to comply with any covenant, the failure to meet any
condition or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice; _provided, further_ , that the failure to comply
with this _Section 6.6_ shall not result in the failure of any of the
conditions to the Closing in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, or give rise to
any right to terminate this Agreement under _Section 8.1_, if the underlying
Event would not in and of itself give rise to such failure or right.

 



 

6.7 **_Public Announcements_**. The initial press release with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a release mutually
agreed upon by Devon and

 



       
 

 



 

Crosstex. Thereafter, except in connection with a Crosstex Recommendation
Change in accordance with _Section 6.4_ (in which case Crosstex will, to the
extent practicable, promptly inform Devon in advance of the substance and
timing of the release or statement), Devon and Crosstex shall consult with and
obtain the approval of the other party (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any other press release or
other public statements with respect to the Mergers or this Agreement, to the
extent they have not been previously issued or disclosed and shall not issue
any such other press release prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable Law or any listing agreement related to the trading of
the shares of either party on any securities exchange, in which case the party
proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall
use reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party
before issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties may respond to inquiries from
securities analysts, and the news media and make such oral and written public
statements, releases or announcements without complying with the preceding
sentence if the substance of such statements, releases or announcements was in
any prior press release or public statement made by a party in accordance with
this _Section 6.7_; _provided, however_ , that such responses shall be in
compliance with applicable securities Laws.

 



 

6.8 **_Indemnification of Directors and Officers_**.

 



 

(a) From and after the Crosstex Effective Time, New Public Rangers shall
indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the
foregoing), in the same manner as provided by Crosstex or any Subsidiary of
Crosstex immediately prior to the Execution Date, each present and former
director, manager, officer and employee of Crosstex and its Subsidiaries and
each person who served as a director, manager, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise if such service was at the request of
Crosstex or any of its Subsidiaries (such persons, in all of their capacities,
together with their respective heirs, executors or administrators,
collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that such Indemnified
Party is or was a director, manager, officer or employee of Crosstex or any of
its Subsidiaries or a director, manager, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit
plan or other enterprise if such service was at the request of Crosstex or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Crosstex Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions by
directors, managers or officers of Crosstex or its Subsidiaries in their
capacities as such arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), and shall provide advancement of expenses to the Indemnified
Parties, in all such cases to the same extent that such persons are
indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the Execution
Date by Crosstex pursuant to Crosstex Organizational Documents and
indemnification agreements, if any, or by any one of Crosstex Subsidiaries
pursuant to such Subsidiarys Organizational Documents and indemnification
agreements of any Subsidiary of Crosstex, if any, in existence on the
Execution Date.

 



 

(b) For six (6) years after the Crosstex Effective Time, New Public Rangers
shall maintain in effect for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties an
insurance and indemnification

 



      
 

 



 

policy with an insurer with the same or better credit rating as the current
carrier for Crosstex that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Crosstex Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") covering each
such person covered by the officers and directors liability insurance policy
of Crosstex on terms with respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable
in the aggregate than those of Crosstex directors and officers insurance
policy in effect on the Execution Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that New
Public Rangers shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by Crosstex
for such coverage; and _provided, further, however_ , that if any annual
premium for such insurance coverage exceeds 250% of such annual premium, New
Public Rangers shall obtain as much coverage as reasonably practicable for a
cost not exceeding such amount. New Public Rangers obligations under this
_Section 6.8(b)_ may be satisfied by New Public Rangers, or, with the
approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) of Devon, Crosstex,
purchasing a "tail" policy from an insurer with substantially the same or
better credit rating as the current carrier for Crosstex existing directors
and officers insurance policy, which (i) has an effective term of six (6)
years from the Crosstex Effective Time, (ii) covers each person covered by
Crosstex directors and officers insurance policy in effect on the Execution
Date or at the Crosstex Effective Time for actions and omissions occurring
prior to the Crosstex Effective Time, and (iii) contains terms that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than those of Crosstex directors and
officers insurance policy in effect on the Execution Date. If such "tail"
policy has been obtained by Crosstex prior to the Crosstex Effective Time, New
Public Rangers shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and
effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by New Public Rangers.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise. New
Public Rangers shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity obligations provided in this _Section 6.8_ unless it
is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to such
indemnity.

 



 

(d) If New Public Rangers, or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of New Public Rangers honor the indemnification
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.8_.

 



 

6.9 **_Employee Benefits_**.

 



 

(a) _Post-closing Employment_. On the Closing Date, Devon shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, make available for hiring by New Public Rangers or
its Subsidiaries all employees (other than corporate general and
administrative personnel) who dedicate their full employment services to the
Midstream Businesses as well as such additional employees as shall be mutually
agreed by Devon and Crosstex between the Execution Date and the Closing Date
(each such employee a " _Transferring Employee_ ") and Crosstex shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, make offers of at-will employment within a
reasonable time prior to the Closing Date to each such

 



      
 

 



 

Transferring Employee with such employment to be effective as of the Closing
Date (to the extent such offers of employment are accepted); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no individual who is collecting payments under any long-term
disability plan or short-term disability plan of Devon or its Affiliates as of
the Closing Date (a " _Disability Employee_ ") shall be a "Transferring
Employee". Each employment offer shall be for a position that has duties that
are materially consistent with the current position held by such Transferring
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and will be made on terms and
conditions sufficient to avoid statutory, contractual, common law or other
severance obligations. In connection with the foregoing offers of employment,
Crosstex shall grant equity awards in the amounts and to such Transferring
Employees as shall be mutually determined by Devon and Crosstex prior to the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Crosstex
and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to hire any Disability Employee
who does not return to bona fide service with Devon or an Affiliate thereof
prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, unless otherwise required
by applicable Law. To the extent a Disability Employee returns to bona fide
service with Devon or an Affiliate thereof prior to the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, Devon or such Affiliate shall provide Crosstex with written
notice thereof as soon as administratively practicable. Upon receipt of such
notice, Crosstex or an Affiliate thereof shall promptly engage in employment
offer and hiring procedures similar to those set forth in this _Section
6.9(a)_ with respect to such Disability Employee.

 



 

(b) _Employee Benefits_. Crosstex shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide to each Transferring Employee (i) for a period of twelve (12) months
after such Transferring Employee commences employment with Crosstex or an
Affiliate thereof under _Section 6.9(a)_, a base salary or wages and bonus
opportunities that are no less favorable than those provided by Devon or its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date (or that would have
reasonably been provided immediately prior to the Closing Date with respect to
a Disability Employee who becomes a Transferring Employee) and (ii) other
employee benefits, plans, programs and arrangements that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees
at Crosstex or its Affiliates under the Crosstex Benefit Plans as in effect on
the Closing Date. Each Transferring Employee shall, effective as of the date
the Transferring Employee commences employment with Crosstex or an Affiliate
hereof under _Section 6.9(a)_, cease to be employed by Devon and its
Affiliates and shall cease all active participation in and accrual of benefits
under the Midstream Group Benefit Plans, except as otherwise provided under
the plan or agreement governing the applicable benefit or required by Law.

 



 

(c) _Severance Obligations_.

 



 

(i) Crosstex or its Affiliates shall bear any costs related to, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Devon or any of its Affiliates from and against,
any claims made by any Midstream Group Employee for any statutory, contractual
or common law severance or separation benefits and other legally mandated
payment obligations (including the employer portion of any employment taxes,
together with any compensation payable during any mandatory termination notice
period related thereto) (collectively, the " _Separation Benefits_ "), in each
case, arising out of or in connection with the failure of Crosstex or its
Affiliates to make offers of employment of any Midstream Group Employee in
accordance with this Agreement and as required by applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) _Section 6.9(c)(ii)_ of the Devon Disclosure Letter lists the plans and
programs in which the Transferred Employees participate immediately prior to
the Effective Date. The Crosstex Entities shall, or shall cause their
Affiliates to, provide each Transferring Employee whose employment is
terminated within twelve (12) months following the Closing Date with severance
and other separation benefits substantially the same as the severance and
other separation benefits, if any, available to such Transferring Employee by
the Midstream Group Entities as in effect prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) _Allocation of Employment Liabilities_. Except with respect to any
liabilities that transfer to Crosstex or its Affiliates pursuant to applicable
Law or as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, Devon or any of
its Affiliates shall retain liability and responsibility for all employment
and employee-benefit related liabilities, obligations, claims or losses that
arise as a result of an event or events that relate to a Transferring Employee
(or any dependent or beneficiary of any Transferring Employee) and that occur
prior to the effective time of such Transferring Employees employment with
Crosstex or an Affiliate thereof. Except with respect to any liabilities that
transfer to Devon or its Affiliates pursuant to applicable Law or as otherwise
specifically provided in this Agreement, Crosstex or any of its Affiliates
shall retain liability and responsibility for all employment and employee-
benefit related liabilities, obligations, claims or losses that arise as a
result of an event or events that relate to the Transferring Employees (or any
dependent or beneficiary of any Transferring Employee) and that occur on or
after the effective time of such Transferring Employees employment with
Crosstex or an Affiliate thereof.

 



 

(e) _Credit for Prior Service_. Crosstex and its Affiliates agree that from
and after the Closing Date, the Transferring Employees shall be credited with
their length of service with the Midstream Group Entities for purposes of
vesting, eligibility and level of benefits under all employee benefit plans,
equity or equity-based awards, bonus plans or agreements, or other programs
and policies (other than employee pension plans subject to Title IV of ERISA)
in which the Transferring Employees may participate in or be covered under
from and after the Closing Date. Such pre-Closing Date service credit shall
also be taken into account for purposes of benefit computation under all
severance or unemployment compensation plans or policies that may apply to the
Transferring Employees after the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) _Vacation Time_. Devon shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, pay an
amount to each Transferring Employee as soon as practical, but in no event
later than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date or such earlier date as
required by applicable Law, equal to the value of the unused paid time off
accrued as of the Closing Date by each Transferring Employee under the paid
time off programs of Devon or its Affiliates. As such, no vacation days, sick
leave, or paid time off accrued under the plans or programs of Devon or its
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date shall roll-over or be credited to the
Transferring Employees under the paid time off plans of Crosstex or its
Affiliates. Accruals of paid time off under the programs of Crosstex or its
Affiliates shall begin following the Closing Date and professional service
credit will be provided to both exempt and non-exempt employees under such
plans.

 



 

(g) _401(k) Plans_. In the event that a Transferring Employee makes a
voluntary election pursuant to Section 401(a)(31) of the Code to roll over his
or her account balance in a tax qualified defined contribution plan sponsored
by Devon or its Affiliates to a tax-qualified

 



      
 

 



 

defined contribution plan sponsored by Crosstex or its Affiliates in which
such Transferring Employee is eligible to participate, Crosstex agrees, or
shall cause its Affiliates to agree, to take commercially reasonable steps to
cause such tax-qualified defined contribution plan to accept such rollover in
cash, but only to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of such
Crosstex Entity plan.

 



 

(h) _Terms of Coverage_. To the extent that any Transferring Employee becomes
covered under a Crosstex Benefit Plan of Crosstex or its Affiliate, any
restrictions on coverage for pre-existing conditions requirements for evidence
of insurability or eligibility waiting periods under such plans will be waived
for such Transferring Employee, to the extent such waiver is permitted under
the applicable Crosstex Benefit Plan. Crosstex or its Affiliates shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide that each Transferring Employee who becomes
covered under a Crosstex Benefit Plan that is a group health plan (including a
"group health plan" as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) shall
receive credit for those sums paid in the current year under the corresponding
Midstream Group Benefit Plan as deductibles, coinsurance and co-payments,
towards any deductible and/or out-of-pocket maximum that may apply under such
Crosstex Benefit Plan.

 



 

(i) _No Assumption of Midstream Group Benefit Plan_. Crosstex and its
Affiliates shall not assume any Midstream Group Benefit Plan or any similar
arrangement of Devon or its Affiliates, and Devon and its Affiliates shall
take all necessary actions to ensure that no such Midstream Group Benefit Plan
or any similar arrangement is assumed by Crosstex or an Affiliate thereof.

 



 

(j) _Additional Information_. The parties agree to furnish each other with
such information concerning employees and employee benefit plans, and to take
all such other action, as is necessary and appropriate to effect the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 6.9_, subject to any applicable
restrictions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996, as amended, and other federal and state privacy Laws. Where any required
information is in the possession of third parties controlled by Crosstex or
Devon, such as insurers or trustees, Crosstex or Devon, as applicable, shall
use reasonable efforts to cause those third parties to cooperate in providing
any such information to the other party.

 



 

(k) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are
solely for the benefit of the respective Parties to this Agreement and nothing
in this _Section 6.9_, express or implied, shall confer upon any Midstream
Group Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or
remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever
under this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 6.9_, express or implied,
shall be (i) deemed an amendment of any plan providing benefits to any
Midstream Group Employee, or (ii) construed to prevent Crosstex or its
Affiliates from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any
benefit plan that they may establish or maintain.

 



 

(l) _Waiver of Acceleration_. Crosstex and its Affiliates shall use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain executed and enforceable Change of Control
Waivers from all executives of Crosstex set forth on _Section 6.9(l)_ of the
Crosstex Disclosure Letter.

 



      
 

 



 

6.10 **_Section 16(b) Matters_**. Prior to the Crosstex Effective Time, Devon
and Crosstex shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of equity securities of Crosstex (including derivative securities
with respect thereto) or acquisitions of equity securities of New Public
Rangers (including derivative securities with respect thereto) resulting from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to Crosstex or who will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to New Public Rangers to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act.

 



 

6.11 **_Takeover Laws_**. If any Takeover Laws or any anti-takeover provision
or restriction on ownership in the Organizational Documents of Crosstex is or
may become applicable to the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Crosstex and the Crosstex Board shall grant such approvals and
take all such actions as are necessary or advisable so that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute, regulation or provision in Crosstex Organizational Documents on such
transactions.

 



 

6.12 **_Transaction Litigation_**. Subject to applicable Law, in the event
that any Proceeding related to this Agreement, the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transaction Litigation_ ") is
brought, or, to the Knowledge of Devon or Crosstex, threatened in writing,
against a party and/or the members of the partys Board of Directors prior to
the Devon Effective Time, such party against which the Proceeding has been
brought or which has Knowledge of such threat shall promptly notify the other
party of such Transaction Litigation and shall keep the other party reasonably
informed with respect to the status thereof. Each of Devon and Crosstex shall
give the other party the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any Transaction Litigation, but no party shall settle,
compromise, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to settle, compromise or
come to an arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation, without the other
partys prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); _provided, however_ , that a party may settle any Transaction
Litigation without the prior written consent of the other party if such
settlement provides (a) for a complete release of the claims, if any, related
to or against such other party and (b) that the sole remedy shall be monetary
damages, the cost of which is borne entirely by the settling party.

 



 

6.13 **_Exchange Listing_**. Each of Devon and Crosstex shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the New Public Rangers Common Units issuable
to stockholders of Crosstex in the Crosstex Merger, the New Public Rangers
Common Units to be issued upon conversion of the New Public Rangers Class B
Units in accordance with the New Public Rangers Limited Liability Company
Agreement and such other New Public Rangers Common Units reserved for issuance
upon exercise or settlement of options and other equity awards of Crosstex to
be approved for listing on a national securities exchange agreed to in writing
by Devon and Crosstex (the " _Agreed Securities Exchange_ "), subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Devon Effective Time.

 



 

6.14 **_Books and Records; Financial Statements._**

 



 

(a) The parties shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, use their
reasonable best efforts to cooperate in the preparation of any financial
statements that may be required to be filed

 



      
 

 



 

with the SEC by any party hereto or any of their respective Affiliates as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby, as necessary to satisfy any
rule or regulation of the SEC or to satisfy relevant disclosure obligations of
any party or any of its Affiliates under the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act.

 



 

(b) The Devon Parties, on the one hand, and Crosstex, on the other hand,
hereby consent to the inclusion or incorporation by reference of any such
financial statements contemplated by _Section 6.14(a)_ in any registration
statement, report or other filing of such other party or any of its
Affiliates, as such other party reasonably determines are required to be
included or incorporated by reference to satisfy any rule or regulation of the
SEC or to satisfy relevant disclosure obligations under the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act. The Devon Parties, on the one hand, and Crosstex, on the
other hand, shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
independent accountants to consent to the inclusion or incorporation by
reference of its audit opinion with respect to any of the financial statements
of such parties or their respective Subsidiaries in any such registration
statement, report or other filing, and the Devon Parties, on the one hand, and
Crosstex, on the other hand, shall cause representation letters, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to its independent accountants, to be
executed and delivered to its independent accountants in connection with
obtaining any such consent from its independent accountants.

 



 

(c) The parties shall cooperate in connection with the preparation of any pro
forma financial statements that are derived in part from the financial
statements of the Devon Parties and any of their Affiliates, on the one hand,
or Crosstex and any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, as the Devon Parties
or Crosstex reasonably determine are required to be included or incorporated
by reference in any registration statement, report or other filing of such
party to satisfy any rule or regulation of the SEC or to satisfy relevant
disclosure obligations under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

 



 

6.15 **_Tax-Free Qualification_**. Each of Devon and Crosstex shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take such actions and refrain from taking such
actions as are reasonably within its control so as to cause it and each of its
Subsidiaries to cause the Devon Merger to qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and to cause both Mergers together
to qualify as a transaction described in Section 351(a) of the Code.

 



 

6.16 **_Tax Representation Letters_**. Each of Devon and Crosstex shall use
its reasonable best efforts to deliver to each of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. ("
_Vinson and Elkins_") and Baker Botts L.L.P. (" _Baker Botts_ ") a tax
representation letter, dated as of the Closing Date and signed by an officer
of Devon or Crosstex, as the case may be, containing such representations as
shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable Vinson and Elkins and
Baker Botts to render the respective opinions described in _Section 7.2(f)_
and _Section 7.3(f)_ of this Agreement (each a " _Tax Representation Letter_
").

similar taxes, together with any

 



      
 

 



 

interest, additions or penalties with respect thereto and any interest in
respect of such additions or penalties, resulting directly and solely from the
Mergers (the " _Transfer Taxes_ "), shall be borne 50% by the Devon Parties,
on the one hand, and 50% by Crosstex, on the other hand. All Transfer Taxes
resulting from the Devon Reorganization Transactions shall be borne 100% by
the Devon Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
6.18_, any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes
shall be prepared and filed when due by the party primarily or customarily
responsible under the applicable local law for filing such Tax Returns, and
such party will use reasonable best efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the
other party at least ten days prior to the due date for such Tax Returns. Upon
the filing of Tax Returns in connection with Transfer Taxes, the filing party
shall provide the other party with evidence satisfactory to the other party
that such Transfer Taxes have been filed and paid.

 



 

6.19 **_Contribution Transactions_**. Unless this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.1_, Crosstex shall, to the fullest extent permitted
under the Crosstex GP LLC Agreement and the Crosstex MLP Partnership
Agreement, but subject to the terms hereof including _Section 6.4_, take all

Agreement, each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Devon and Devon Gas Services shall from time to
time after the Closing, execute, deliver, acknowledge, file and record, or
cause to be executed, delivered, acknowledged, filed and recorded, such
further instruments of sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery and
such further consents, certifications, affidavits and assurances as New Public
Rangers may reasonably request in order to vest in New Public Rangers and its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective successors and assigns all right,
title and interest in the Midstream Business or otherwise to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements
upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. The parties will coordinate
and cooperate with each other in exchanging such information and assistance as

not involve fraud or a Willful and Material Breach as described in _Section
8.2(b)_, for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone

Material Breach and upon payment of such amounts Crosstex shall have no

consent of the other parties, and any attempted or purported assignment
without such consent shall be null and void.

 



 

10.6 **_Extension; Waiver_**. At any time prior to the Devon Effective Time,
the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, managers, general partner

 



      
 

 



 

or other applicable governing body, may to the extent legally allowed, (a)
extend the time for performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other parties hereunder, (b) waive any breach or inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other of
any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by any party in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right hereunder. No
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any extension or waiver shall be
valid unless set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party.

 



 

10.7 **_Third Party Beneficiaries_**. Subject to _Section 10.5_, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure solely to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except
(a) with respect to the Indemnified Parties solely pursuant to _Section 6.8_
(which shall have no effect until the Devon Effective Time) and (b) from and
after the Crosstex Effective Time, the right of the Crosstex stockholders to
receive the Crosstex Merger Consideration, nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 



 

10.8 **_Interpretation_**.

 



 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to an Article, Section, Schedule, Exhibit or Annex,
such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of, a Schedule to, an
Exhibit to or Annex to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the
words " _include,_ " " _includes_ " or " _including_ " are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words " _without
limitation_."

 



 

(b) Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all references to currency,
monetary values and dollars set forth herein shall mean United States (U.S.)
dollars, " _$_ " refers to United States dollars and all payments hereunder
shall be made in United States dollars by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to such account as shall have been specified in writing by the
recipient thereof.

 



 

10.9 **_Governing Law and Venue; Consent to Jurisdiction_**.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN DELAWARE, AND IN ALL RESPECTS
SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY CONFLICTS OF LAW
PRINCIPLES TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF
THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action, suit or
proceeding with respect to the interpretation and enforcement of this
Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the

 



       
 

 



 

negotiations thereof, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the
state of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware, including any applicable appellate court). Each of the
parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert, as a defense in any legal action, suit or Proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement or of any document referred to
in this Agreement, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such courts. The parties consent to and
grant to the extent permitted by Law, any said court jurisdiction over the
subject matter of any dispute contemplated by this _Section 10.9_ and agree
that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action,
suit or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 10.1_ or in such other
manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 10.9(c)_.

 



 

10.10 **_Disclosure Letters_**. The statements in the Crosstex Disclosure
Letter and the Devon Disclosure Letter relate to the provisions in the section
of this Agreement to which they expressly relate; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any information set forth in one section of the Crosstex Disclosure
Letter or the Devon Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, shall also be
deemed to apply to each other section to which its relevance is reasonably
apparent. In the Crosstex Disclosure Letter and the Devon Disclosure Letter,
(a) all capitalized terms used but not defined therein shall have the meanings
assigned to them in this Agreement; (b) the section numbers correspond to the
section numbers in this Agreement; and (c) inclusion of any item in a
disclosure letter (i) does not represent a determination that such item is
material or establish a standard of materiality, (ii) does not represent a
determination that such item did not arise in the ordinary course of business
and (iii) shall not constitute, or be deemed to be, an admission to any third
party concerning such item.

 



      
 

 



 

10.11 **_Specific Performance_**. The parties acknowledge and agree that each
would be irreparably damaged in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached and that any non-performance or breach of this Agreement by
any party could not be adequately compensated by money damages alone and that
the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law. Each party agrees that,
in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any
provisions contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether
in law or equity, including monetary damages, except as limited by _Section
8.3_) to seek (a) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the
observance and performance of such provisions, and (b) an injunction
restraining such breach or threatened breach. Each party further agrees that
no other party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10.11_, and each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. The parties further agree
that they shall not object to the granting of injunctive relief on the basis
that an adequate remedy at law may exist.

 



 

10.12 **_Joint Obligation_**. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of
Crosstex or Devon to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Crosstex or Devon, as appropriate, to
cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 



 

10.13 **_Facsimiles; Counterparts_**. Delivery of an executed signature page
of this Agreement by facsimile or other customary means of electronic
transmission (e.g., pdf) shall be deemed binding for all purposes hereof,
without delivery of an original signature page being thereafter required. This
Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which, when
executed, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall
constitute one and the same document.

 



 

10.14 **_Amendment_**. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law, and except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Crosstex
Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only
by a written instrument executed and delivered by all the parties, whether
before or after stockholder approval of the Devon Merger and/or Crosstex
Merger; _provided, however_ , that, after any such approval, no amendment
shall be made for which applicable Law or the rules of any relevant stock
exchange requires further approval by stockholders without such further
approval.

 



 

10.15 **_Representation by Counsel_**. Each of the parties agrees that it has
been represented by independent counsel of its choice during the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein. Each
party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this
Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts
relating thereto shall be deemed the work product of the parties and may not
be construed against any party by reason of its preparation. Therefore, the
parties waive the application of any Law providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.
